1
00:01:28,231 --> 00:01:29,816
Would you like
something sweet?

2
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:30,942
Oh.

3
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:50,002
What do we got here, fellas,
an antique show?

4
00:01:50,086 --> 00:01:51,796
All right, boys, fan out!

5
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:54,257
What a wrinkle fest this is.

6
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:01,472
Hey, beat it, you broads!
Come on!

7
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:03,975
All right, sit down
and shut up!

8
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,729
We're the Red Eyes.
So, everybody, freeze!

9
00:02:07,812 --> 00:02:11,232
Get their valuables, boys. I
want watches, wallets, jewelry.

10
00:02:11,315 --> 00:02:14,861
Get me some silver chains.
I want wigs. I want toupees.

11
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,324
Keep an eye out
for me, will ya?

12
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:24,454
No, not mine! Leave me alone!
I'm a veteran!

13
00:02:24,537 --> 00:02:27,540
No! Not that!

14
00:02:28,499 --> 00:02:30,668
I love crashing parties!

15
00:02:32,754 --> 00:02:35,173
Hey, cake!

16
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:40,636
Pardon me, Fatty.

17
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,683
But if you're going to eat
cake, you ought to use a fork.

18
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:49,312
You might just as well
shovelflin.

19
00:02:53,524 --> 00:02:56,444
People who don't close
their mouths when they chew

20
00:02:56,527 --> 00:02:58,863
make me furious.

21
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:10,625
One for you. Drat.

22
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,418
And for you!

23
00:03:14,212 --> 00:03:16,214
Come on, come on.

24
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:20,134
Want a little whipped cream,
Mr. Cherry Top?

25
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:23,387
Get him, get him.

26
00:03:26,015 --> 00:03:28,935
Is that all you got, huh?
Is that all you...

27
00:03:34,774 --> 00:03:35,817
Throw it!

28
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,236
Not today,
my vermilion-eyed varlet.

29
00:03:39,237 --> 00:03:41,697
Oh, blast.

30
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,242
Out of the way!

31
00:03:54,585 --> 00:03:56,546
Yes, this one should stick.

32
00:04:01,884 --> 00:04:05,388
Oh, my! That's way
too tight, man!

33
00:04:24,115 --> 00:04:25,616
It's Captain Amazing!

34
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:29,120
It's Amazing! I'm out of here!

35
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:54,645
C.A., you were,
if I may say, amazing.

36
00:04:54,812 --> 00:04:55,897
Yeah?
Yeah.

37
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,857
Let's go meet the press.

38
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,443
He is good.

39
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,653
He is rather ripping,
isn't he?

40
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:05,281
The spinning and the hurting
and the kicking.

41
00:05:05,489 --> 00:05:08,159
I guarantee you he hogs
the credit on this one.

42
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:10,286
Well, I think we have to

43
00:05:10,369 --> 00:05:12,872
at least concede him
the assist here, Roy.

44
00:05:13,372 --> 00:05:16,250
No, no. You see? That's exactly
what's holding us back.

45
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:19,253
Don't put him on the pedestal,
put us on the pedestal.

46
00:05:19,337 --> 00:05:20,922
Here he comes.

47
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,217
Bravo and huzzah, Captain.
Splendid work, as usual.

48
00:05:25,301 --> 00:05:27,970
No autographs till
we finish with the press.

49
00:05:28,054 --> 00:05:30,723
We're not...
Allow me to introduce myself.

50
00:05:30,806 --> 00:05:32,725
Blue Raja,
master of silverware,

51
00:05:32,808 --> 00:05:34,644
forks a specialty,
at your service.

52
00:05:34,727 --> 00:05:36,103
My colleague, the Shoveler.

53
00:05:36,187 --> 00:05:37,521
Big fan of your work.

54
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:41,150
And standing rather painfully
aside is our cohort, Mr. Furious.

55
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:42,276
How's it hanging?

56
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,527
SQ you guys...

57
00:05:44,862 --> 00:05:47,406
They're superheroes.

58
00:05:47,698 --> 00:05:50,326
VVe fight crime. Call it what you will.
Quite right.

59
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:52,870
That's great. Just, you know,

60
00:05:53,204 --> 00:05:55,122
keep up the good work.

61
00:05:55,748 --> 00:05:59,043
You as well, sir. You as well.

62
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:04,131
Did you see... Did you...

63
00:06:04,215 --> 00:06:06,801
Did you hear that?
"Keep up the good work."

64
00:06:06,926 --> 00:06:07,927
The good work.

65
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,053
He's making fun of us.

66
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:11,806
No,Roy He saluted us.
That was real.

67
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:13,808
I thought he was sincere.
What's up, fellas?

68
00:06:13,891 --> 00:06:15,851
Hello.
Nice to see you.

69
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:19,271
I saw the action
out there tonight.

70
00:06:19,355 --> 00:06:22,650
What you guys need is
a little bit of firepower.

71
00:06:22,775 --> 00:06:23,901
Well...

72
00:06:23,985 --> 00:06:25,736
I'm a weapons designer.

73
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:28,364
I've got what you need.

74
00:06:28,447 --> 00:06:30,825
All right.
We'll come back.

75
00:06:30,908 --> 00:06:34,537
We'll visit all of you people later.
Thank you, sir.

76
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,832
I don't live here.
I'm here for the ladies.

77
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,919
Here, take my card.

78
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:45,756
My name's Heller.
Say it with me.

79
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:47,508
Heller.
Heller.

80
00:06:47,591 --> 00:06:50,136
All right. Thank you.

81
00:06:51,929 --> 00:06:53,014
Goodnight.

82
00:06:53,097 --> 00:06:54,765
I don't know why you encourage
those people.

83
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:56,684
Those people look up to us.

84
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,436
Oh, that's true.

85
00:06:59,603 --> 00:07:00,688
You know the drill.

86
00:07:00,771 --> 00:07:02,815
Please sign my hat,
Captain Amazing.

87
00:07:03,607 --> 00:07:05,276
Herman, give me a flash.

88
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,029
Hey, how are you tonight?

89
00:07:08,112 --> 00:07:10,990
Captain, how did you know
where to find the Red Eyes?

90
00:07:11,073 --> 00:07:13,826
Becky, it's what I do.

91
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:15,828
Thanks to you,
the city's almost crime-free.

92
00:07:15,911 --> 00:07:18,205
So what do you do
with your free time?

93
00:07:18,622 --> 00:07:20,374
I wish that I had
some free time.

94
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:24,045
People are saying that you're so "amazing"
you're gonna put yourself out of a job.

95
00:07:24,128 --> 00:07:25,463
Have any comments on that?

96
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:27,923
That's one problem
I look forward to.

97
00:07:28,007 --> 00:07:31,719
And is it true that you lost
your Pepsi endorsement?

98
00:07:33,596 --> 00:07:35,389
I hadn't heard that.

99
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:37,725
Thanks so muoh for your questions.
Thank all of you so muoh.

100
00:07:37,808 --> 00:07:41,645
You sure, you have no comments
regarding your Pepsi situation?

101
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,031
Look who we got.

102
00:07:52,114 --> 00:07:54,658
You again. Wannabes.

103
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:57,411
This city already
has a superhero.

104
00:07:57,495 --> 00:08:00,247
Perhaps you've heard of him.
Captain Amazing.

105
00:08:00,331 --> 00:08:01,582
Thank you.

106
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,086
Do yourself a favor, Maguire.

107
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:07,129
Don't flip my switch tonight.

108
00:08:07,213 --> 00:08:11,717
And what exactly
would that do?

109
00:08:12,218 --> 00:08:15,346
Don't turn around, Roy. Don't do it.
Don't turn around.

110
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:17,765
It's nothing. Keep walking, Roy.
Keep walking.

111
00:08:17,848 --> 00:08:19,809
It's not worth it.

112
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,941
I think you know exactly what
that would do, checkerhead.

113
00:08:30,694 --> 00:08:31,946
What?

114
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:35,825
Don't mess with
the volcano, my man.

115
00:08:37,868 --> 00:08:41,872
'Cause I will go Pompeii
on your butt.

116
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:47,169
Oh, my golly.
Good grief.

117
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:50,881
You keep dreaming, wannabe.

118
00:08:53,342 --> 00:08:56,512
Let's go.
Dream on, moron.

119
00:08:56,846 --> 00:08:59,974
I will keep dreaming. I will
keep dreaming, my friend.

120
00:09:00,349 --> 00:09:02,893
And when I wake up,
you better hope,

121
00:09:04,061 --> 00:09:06,021
you better hope you're asleep.

122
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:08,315
Don't reengage him.
He's a silly...

123
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,483
Sweet dreams!

124
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:10,568
He's immature.

125
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:11,777
Lilac.

126
00:09:15,531 --> 00:09:17,283
C.A., I'm doing my best.

127
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:22,246
Your best? Quick question:
Is this your best?

128
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,165
I realize you're upset.

129
00:09:24,248 --> 00:09:25,833
Victor, I'm positioned.

130
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:30,379
Do you understand what that means?
On a very personal level here,

131
00:09:30,462 --> 00:09:33,174
to know that the companies
that make these fine products

132
00:09:33,257 --> 00:09:36,260
want me to be their spokesperson?
Their voice?

133
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,346
I think right now we should
focus on the positive.

134
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,098
Tonight was good.

135
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:43,017
Yeah? You think so?

136
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:47,813
'Cause I was worried it was,
I don't know, pathetic!

137
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,648
"Amazing triumphs
at a nursing home!"

138
00:09:49,732 --> 00:09:51,400
That's great copy, Vic.

139
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:53,611
I'm a publicist,
not a magician.

140
00:09:53,736 --> 00:09:55,821
You want big news,
you have to have big fights.

141
00:09:55,905 --> 00:09:59,867
A superhero needs a supervillain and,
thanks to you, we've got none left.

142
00:10:00,284 --> 00:10:03,454
Then get the Death Man.

143
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:04,705
Death Man is dead.

144
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:06,498
Okay. Father Doom.

145
00:10:06,582 --> 00:10:07,917
Life without parole.

146
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,212
Apocalypta's doing 50 years.
Armagezzmo's in exile.

147
00:10:11,295 --> 00:10:13,005
Baron Von Chaos got the chair.

148
00:10:13,088 --> 00:10:14,089
Really?

149
00:10:14,173 --> 00:10:16,508
Casanova Frankenstein
is locked up in a nuthouse.

150
00:10:16,592 --> 00:10:18,385
Casanova Frankenstein.

151
00:10:18,928 --> 00:10:21,222
Now, there was a supervillain.

152
00:10:21,305 --> 00:10:24,266
You know, he just...

153
00:10:24,516 --> 00:10:26,977
He's got those eyes, you know?

154
00:10:27,144 --> 00:10:29,355
I can't do it, but...

155
00:10:29,688 --> 00:10:31,398
And that voice...
Such pure evil.

156
00:10:31,482 --> 00:10:34,235
The battles we used to have.
Extraordinary.

157
00:10:34,318 --> 00:10:35,653
"Used to."

158
00:10:35,986 --> 00:10:39,114
That's the problem,
Captain. "Used to."

159
00:11:13,983 --> 00:11:15,276
<i>Let the record show</i>

160
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:17,611
<i>that this parole hearing
has officially begun.</i>

161
00:11:34,253 --> 00:11:39,383
We now commence the 17th parole
hearing of Casanova Frankenstein.

162
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:42,011
Dr. Leek, you may begin.

163
00:11:43,387 --> 00:11:44,471
Thank you.

164
00:11:46,181 --> 00:11:49,310
Gentlemen of the board,
the man who sits before you,

165
00:11:49,393 --> 00:11:54,064
the once infamous evil genius,
is entirely cured.

166
00:11:54,398 --> 00:11:55,441
What?

167
00:11:55,524 --> 00:11:56,483
I give you my word

168
00:11:56,567 --> 00:12:00,863
that he's of no more danger
to the city than I am.

169
00:12:01,572 --> 00:12:02,573
This is outrageous.

170
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:04,033
Yes.

171
00:12:04,742 --> 00:12:06,535
Mr. Casanova
Frankenstein,

172
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:10,372
do you have anything to say
on your own behalf?

173
00:12:10,914 --> 00:12:14,960
Blessed disciples
of Hippocrates,

174
00:12:17,546 --> 00:12:20,883
my heart is split in two.

175
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:24,595
It brims

176
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:29,183
with such sorrow
for my abominable crimes.

177
00:12:29,892 --> 00:12:31,101
And yet,

178
00:12:31,435 --> 00:12:33,395
it swells with love

179
00:12:33,771 --> 00:12:35,439
for you,

180
00:12:36,482 --> 00:12:39,193
for this sanctuary,

181
00:12:39,276 --> 00:12:42,154
this place of healing.

182
00:12:43,238 --> 00:12:46,992
Within my soul,
I feel the choir singing

183
00:12:47,618 --> 00:12:50,454
Beethoven's immortal
Ode to Joy

184
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:54,500
where all men

185
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,628
become brothers.

186
00:13:00,631 --> 00:13:03,467
Am I too late to cast my vote?

187
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:08,430
Not at all, Lance. I was just
about to remind the board

188
00:13:08,764 --> 00:13:12,935
that Casanova once had our city
in a stranglehold of terror.

189
00:13:13,018 --> 00:13:17,648
Parole is not an option
for this man, this monster.

190
00:13:18,148 --> 00:13:20,150
We cannot risk
the danger of releasing him.

191
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:22,736
I could not agree
with you more.

192
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,821
ExceHenL

193
00:13:24,113 --> 00:13:29,618
However, I did just have dinner
with an old friend recently.

194
00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:32,579
Maybe you've heard of him?
Captain Amazing.

195
00:13:32,663 --> 00:13:33,789
Captain Amazing?

196
00:13:33,872 --> 00:13:37,501
He asked if I would read this.

197
00:13:40,671 --> 00:13:42,297
"Dear members of the board,

198
00:13:42,381 --> 00:13:44,758
"we all know that society
cannot exist

199
00:13:44,842 --> 00:13:47,052
"without absolute justice,

200
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:53,183
"but society is also
built upon compassion.

201
00:13:53,851 --> 00:13:56,478
"Let us set the tone
for the new millennium

202
00:13:56,562 --> 00:13:58,981
"by making a historic
gesture of forgiveness.

203
00:13:59,064 --> 00:14:01,608
"Ladies and gentlemen,
I implore you,

204
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,946
"let us grant
Casanova Frankenstein

205
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,032
"a second chance."

206
00:14:10,868 --> 00:14:16,498
With Captain Amazing's
recommendation and protection,

207
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:20,544
I suppose we could consider.

208
00:14:21,712 --> 00:14:23,714
I pronounce you

209
00:14:27,885 --> 00:14:29,052
cured.

210
00:14:34,057 --> 00:14:37,227
Hello, Champion City.

211
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:43,817
Daddy is home.

212
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,251
<i>Hi, everybody.</i>

213
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:03,921
<i>You know, tooth decay
and gingivitis can be a crime.</i>

214
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:06,423
<i>That's why I use
Mighty Whity toothpaste.</i>

215
00:15:06,798 --> 00:15:10,427
<i>Because I want my teeth
to look amazing.</i>

216
00:15:12,763 --> 00:15:14,014
I'm gonna bring this up again.

217
00:15:14,097 --> 00:15:16,266
It's 150 bucks apiece.
We each chip in.

218
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,685
My cousin knows this guy who
knows a publicist.

219
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:22,564
What are we gonna publicize? The fact
that we get our butts kicked a lot.

220
00:15:22,648 --> 00:15:25,484
Maybe if you didn't smack me in the face
with the shovel every time we went out...

221
00:15:25,609 --> 00:15:27,569
All right now....we'd have
some more wins to brag about.

222
00:15:27,653 --> 00:15:30,447
I'm sorry, I just have
atendencytolose my concentration

223
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:32,616
when I've got a salad fork
stuck in my rear end.

224
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,786
I get it. Your shovel
in his face is my fault.

225
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:39,081
You threw a spoon
at the guy, Jeff.

226
00:15:39,164 --> 00:15:40,290
What was up with that?

227
00:15:40,374 --> 00:15:41,416
I'm embarrassed about that.

228
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,543
I thought it was a fork.

229
00:15:42,626 --> 00:15:43,627
You're the master of cutlery.

230
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,964
You can't throw a knife sometimes
when someone's trying to kill me?

231
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:48,840
You can't use
a rake sometimes?

232
00:15:48,924 --> 00:15:49,925
No, I'm the Shoveler.

233
00:15:50,008 --> 00:15:52,302
I'm the Blue Raja.
I'm not Stab Man.

234
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:55,347
I'm not Knifey Boy.
I'm the Blue Raja.

235
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,390
That's another thing.

236
00:15:56,473 --> 00:15:57,474
What?

237
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:59,893
You could get a little bit of
blue in the uniform somewhere.

238
00:15:59,977 --> 00:16:03,522
You've got green. There's
a little flowery thing.

239
00:16:03,605 --> 00:16:06,400
It doesn't make
alotofsense.

240
00:16:06,483 --> 00:16:09,278
Just step out of our literal
minds for a moment.

241
00:16:09,945 --> 00:16:11,989
Hey, look what I'm doing.
Look at that.

242
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:14,283
I'm putting 150 right on the table.
Who's in with me?

243
00:16:14,366 --> 00:16:16,410
I don't have 150, do I?

244
00:16:16,493 --> 00:16:19,079
If I did, I wouldn't have
plundered my mother's silverware.

245
00:16:19,162 --> 00:16:20,247
It's a waste of money.

246
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,166
You know who doesn't think
it's a waste of money?

247
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:24,585
Little Mr. Captain Amazing.

248
00:16:24,668 --> 00:16:25,669
Well, Captain...

249
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:28,422
If we had a billionaire like
Lance Hunt as our benefactor,

250
00:16:28,505 --> 00:16:30,424
yeah, we could spend 150.

251
00:16:30,507 --> 00:16:32,259
Lance Hunt is Captain Amazing.

252
00:16:32,342 --> 00:16:35,178
Don't start that again.

253
00:16:35,846 --> 00:16:39,808
Lance Hunt wears glasses. Captain
Amazing doesn't wear glasses.

254
00:16:39,891 --> 00:16:41,810
He takes them off
when he transforms.

255
00:16:41,893 --> 00:16:45,314
That doesn't make any sense.
He wouldn't be able to see.

256
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,277
Hi, thanks for waiting.

257
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,195
Hey, thanks for dropping by.

258
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:54,239
Do you know what you want?

259
00:16:54,323 --> 00:16:56,241
Allow me to begin, my dear.

260
00:16:56,325 --> 00:16:58,619
The Blue Raja is quite partial
to the salad nigoise.

261
00:16:58,702 --> 00:17:01,204
My dressing of choice
is ranch lite,

262
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:04,374
and I'd appreciate it
if you'd hold the Bacon Bits.

263
00:17:04,499 --> 00:17:08,086
Seeing as it's your first night and
all, I suppose I'll "fork-give" you

264
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,213
if you "fork-get."

265
00:17:11,465 --> 00:17:12,549
Who's next?

266
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:15,510
Can I get a meatball sandwich
on white with mayo?

267
00:17:15,594 --> 00:17:18,597
I'll have a steak, please. Very rare.
That means pink, not bloody.

268
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,223
And could I get some ice?

269
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:23,310
I had a little mishap defending
justice at the nursing home.

270
00:17:23,393 --> 00:17:26,229
I thought I heard on TV
that was Captain Amazing.

271
00:17:28,857 --> 00:17:33,195
Let's all be good little automaton droids
and believe everything we hear on TV.

272
00:17:35,238 --> 00:17:38,408
I'll just go place
your order now.

273
00:17:40,452 --> 00:17:43,622
A trifle strident with that bit
of crumpet, weren't we, Furious?

274
00:17:43,705 --> 00:17:46,416
I am a ticking
time bomb of fury.

275
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:49,878
All I'm saying is, when we
split the check three ways,

276
00:17:49,961 --> 00:17:52,547
the steak-eater picks
the pocket of the salad man.

277
00:17:52,631 --> 00:17:54,174
Just give me the money, Jeff.

278
00:17:54,257 --> 00:17:55,467
Yes, fine.

279
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,928
Every time we split it
three ways.

280
00:17:58,011 --> 00:17:59,012
It's flipping robbery.

281
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:01,682
Well, you should order more.

282
00:18:04,935 --> 00:18:06,520
Do you see what I see?

283
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:08,939
RAJAI Hello?

284
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:10,190
SHOVELERI It's Tony C.

285
00:18:10,273 --> 00:18:13,819
And Tony P,
leader of the Disco Boys.

286
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:27,624
But why, pray tell,
would he be back in town?

287
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,586
Maybe it's time to do a
little following to find out.

288
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,463
No,
it's already 10:30.

289
00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:35,716
I'm gonna get killed
by my wife as it is.

290
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:39,469
Yes, and I've had quite enough
excitement for one night, thank you.

291
00:18:39,636 --> 00:18:43,724
My mistake. I thought I was hanging
out with serious superheroes:

292
00:18:43,807 --> 00:18:45,392
the Shoveler
and the Blue Raja.

293
00:18:45,475 --> 00:18:49,479
But, apparently, I'm hanging
out with Lazy Boy and...

294
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:50,564
Good night, Roy.

295
00:18:50,647 --> 00:18:51,690
Yes, toodle-oo.

296
00:18:51,773 --> 00:18:54,109
Hang on a second.
Lazy Boy and the...

297
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:57,404
And the Recliner!

298
00:18:57,487 --> 00:19:00,574
Yeah, Lazy Boy
and the Recliner!

299
00:19:00,782 --> 00:19:03,118
Guys, are you coming?
Are you...

300
00:19:07,164 --> 00:19:10,751
Okay, fine. I guess tonight

301
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:12,919
the lone wolf

302
00:19:13,003 --> 00:19:15,672
hunts alone.

303
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:27,142
Testicles rising.

304
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:30,645
Can't breathe. Can't breathe.

305
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:15,816
Butch needs his vest back.
He's got a game on Saturday.

306
00:20:16,274 --> 00:20:18,819
Well, it's my vest too.
I bought it for him.

307
00:20:18,902 --> 00:20:21,530
The only thing I need...

308
00:20:21,738 --> 00:20:22,864
Okay.

309
00:20:22,948 --> 00:20:24,574
How long you gonna
do this, Eddie?

310
00:20:25,408 --> 00:20:27,369
It's been 12 years.

311
00:20:27,452 --> 00:20:28,453
I know.

312
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:32,082
You got a family
to look after, Eddie.

313
00:20:32,249 --> 00:20:34,793
The kids are worried sick
aboutyou.

314
00:20:35,043 --> 00:20:39,089
But still you go out, night after night,
running around the city for what?

315
00:20:39,381 --> 00:20:43,343
Lucille, God gave me a gift.

316
00:20:43,593 --> 00:20:47,013
I shovel well.
I shovel very well.

317
00:20:47,097 --> 00:20:52,185
Oh, baby, you shovel better
than any man I've known

318
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:54,938
but that does not make you
a superhero.

319
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:56,189
All I...

320
00:20:56,273 --> 00:20:57,274
Oh, no.

321
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,360
You're a good husband

322
00:21:00,443 --> 00:21:02,779
and a good father,

323
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:06,283
but that's all, nothing more.

324
00:21:10,453 --> 00:21:12,747
You're right.

325
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:15,417
I believe in you, Daddy.

326
00:21:16,418 --> 00:21:19,421
Roland, do not
encourage your father.

327
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:27,929
Well, if it isn't
our old friends, the Red Eyes.

328
00:21:28,013 --> 00:21:31,600
Good evening. VVe weren't expecting
to see you again so spoon...

329
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:38,982
Red Eyes, Red Eyes.
What a treat.

330
00:21:39,232 --> 00:21:43,069
We weren't expecting to
see you again so spoon.

331
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:45,780
Jeffrey.
Yeah?

332
00:21:45,864 --> 00:21:49,284
Mom, how many times have I asked
you not to barge in here?

333
00:21:49,951 --> 00:21:51,202
What's burning?

334
00:21:51,286 --> 00:21:52,287
Incense.

335
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,915
I can't even count how many rules
you're breaking right now.

336
00:21:54,998 --> 00:21:58,001
One: Always knock. Two: Don't
sniff around outside my door.

337
00:21:58,084 --> 00:22:00,253
Three: Do not interrogate me.

338
00:22:00,337 --> 00:22:01,338
Jeffrey.

339
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:02,505
What?

340
00:22:02,714 --> 00:22:04,424
Are you into marijuana?

341
00:22:05,216 --> 00:22:07,510
You're cheesing me off
so bad right now.

342
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:09,095
Just, please... Good night.

343
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:11,306
I'm sorry.
Jeffrey, please...

344
00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:12,390
Goodnight.

345
00:22:12,474 --> 00:22:13,516
Okay. Goodnight.

346
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,355
God, she's just so...

347
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:56,643
All right, let's see
what's shaking

348
00:22:56,893 --> 00:23:00,230
at the Chez Casa Casanova.

349
00:23:49,362 --> 00:23:53,074
Ah! The old disco room.

350
00:23:58,621 --> 00:24:01,041
Just as I left it.

351
00:24:01,124 --> 00:24:05,795
You've been locked up for 20 years. A
lot of things have changed since then.

352
00:24:06,796 --> 00:24:11,342
It must have been hard for you, the
way times and styles have changed,

353
00:24:12,969 --> 00:24:16,056
to hear the people saying
that disco is dead.

354
00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:19,184
Disco is not dead!
Disco is life!

355
00:24:19,476 --> 00:24:22,854
Yes, Tony, that is the passion
I remember.

356
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,321
Stick with me, Tony,
and you will dance again

357
00:24:32,322 --> 00:24:34,324
when I rule this town.

358
00:24:39,871 --> 00:24:42,332
Have you met
my psychiatrist?

359
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:47,587
Come out, come out
wherever you...

360
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,589
There we go.

361
00:24:50,131 --> 00:24:51,800
Looks like we got
a little terrace party.

362
00:24:51,883 --> 00:24:55,136
I want you to spread
the word to all of my gangs.

363
00:24:55,845 --> 00:24:59,099
Tell them that
Casanova Frankenstein is back

364
00:24:59,307 --> 00:25:02,602
and that Casanova Frankenstein
is planning something

365
00:25:02,685 --> 00:25:04,687
a little bit different.

366
00:25:05,897 --> 00:25:07,357
Kaboom.

367
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,534
Mama pajama!

368
00:25:20,703 --> 00:25:23,581
What kind of crazy man
blows up a crazy house?

369
00:25:23,665 --> 00:25:26,960
And now, if you will excuse
me, I am expecting a visit

370
00:25:27,043 --> 00:25:29,129
from a very old friend.

371
00:25:39,973 --> 00:25:43,226
Look what we got. A little booty
oall from Captain Amazing.

372
00:25:47,147 --> 00:25:51,484
This is a fine,
elegant Harvey Wallbanger.

373
00:25:53,486 --> 00:25:56,239
Even when it's sucked
by scum like you?

374
00:25:56,698 --> 00:25:59,325
Captain Amazing.
What a surprise.

375
00:26:00,368 --> 00:26:03,246
Really? I'm not
so sure about that.

376
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:07,876
Your first night of freedom,
and you blow up the asylum.

377
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:10,795
Interesting choice.
I knew you couldn't change.

378
00:26:11,045 --> 00:26:12,172
I knew you'd know that.

379
00:26:12,255 --> 00:26:13,298
Oh, I know that.

380
00:26:13,381 --> 00:26:16,092
And I knew you'd know
I'd know you knew.

381
00:26:16,342 --> 00:26:20,513
But I didn't. I only knew
that you'd know that I knew.

382
00:26:21,764 --> 00:26:23,474
Did you know that?

383
00:26:25,935 --> 00:26:26,936
Of course.

384
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,605
Please, won't you join me?

385
00:26:28,897 --> 00:26:29,898
With pleasure.

386
00:26:30,315 --> 00:26:32,108
Oh, quick thought.

387
00:26:32,192 --> 00:26:35,069
Would you mind removing
the submicronic laser

388
00:26:35,153 --> 00:26:37,697
in the ring on the index
finger of your left hand?

389
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,241
Of course. And, if it
wouldn't be too much trouble,

390
00:26:40,325 --> 00:26:42,243
go ahead and disengage

391
00:26:42,327 --> 00:26:46,206
the psychotropic bacterium
dart-launchers in your slippers.

392
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:47,749
Done.

393
00:26:47,832 --> 00:26:52,837
The cold fusion ultrasonic neuro-stunner
in your drink stirrer, turn it off.

394
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:55,965
We know each other so well,
don't we, Lance?

395
00:26:56,674 --> 00:27:00,261
We've always been each other's
greatest nemesises.

396
00:27:00,762 --> 00:27:01,930
Nemesis...

397
00:27:02,972 --> 00:27:04,766
What's the plural on that?

398
00:27:06,017 --> 00:27:07,310
Nemeses.

399
00:27:07,977 --> 00:27:09,020
Whatever.

400
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:12,065
You're going to prison
for life this time, Casanova.

401
00:27:12,148 --> 00:27:13,566
You see, here in
Champion City,

402
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,527
we still do
a fairly brisk trade

403
00:27:17,487 --> 00:27:18,738
in justice.

404
00:27:18,821 --> 00:27:22,825
I thought it was all about the publicity
and keeping your sponsors happy.

405
00:27:22,992 --> 00:27:25,370
See, it's that kind
of cynicism that I truly feel

406
00:27:25,453 --> 00:27:28,081
is starting to poison society.

407
00:27:28,164 --> 00:27:30,083
Oh, looky here.

408
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:33,253
A multi-frequency
radio detonator.

409
00:27:33,336 --> 00:27:36,422
You should be more careful when
discarding incriminating evidence.

410
00:27:36,506 --> 00:27:39,926
Oh, no. This is
an amusing little gizmo.

411
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:42,011
It's really quite cool.

412
00:27:42,845 --> 00:27:45,181
Yeah? What is it?

413
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:49,602
Yuck.

414
00:27:49,852 --> 00:27:54,148
It's a chloroform-deploying
portable enticement snare.

415
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,821
Ah, dang!

416
00:28:03,324 --> 00:28:05,118
Oh, Lancie,

417
00:28:05,618 --> 00:28:07,537
you really are so predictable.

418
00:28:21,718 --> 00:28:22,927
Morning, Sally.

419
00:28:23,011 --> 00:28:24,012
You're late!

420
00:28:24,095 --> 00:28:25,388
Yes, I know.

421
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:27,974
I was up all night, trying to
defend the city from evil,

422
00:28:28,057 --> 00:28:29,976
but I'm sure you don't
really care about that.

423
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:33,313
Work starts at 9:00!
It's 9:25!

424
00:28:33,396 --> 00:28:35,690
So I guess all the junk's
probably ruined by now.

425
00:28:35,773 --> 00:28:39,152
Sucker, when are you gonna tear
down that jeep like I told you to?

426
00:28:39,235 --> 00:28:41,154
I thought we went
through this yesterday.

427
00:28:41,237 --> 00:28:44,907
That old jeep is actually
an armored car of some type.

428
00:28:44,991 --> 00:28:47,368
It was meant to withstand bombs. I
c:an'tjust rip it apart with a crowbar.

429
00:28:47,452 --> 00:28:49,287
Just junk it.

430
00:28:49,412 --> 00:28:51,914
If you gave me
the proper tools, I could...

431
00:28:51,998 --> 00:28:52,999
Junkifl

432
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,919
I'm willing to have
this discussion with you,

433
00:28:57,003 --> 00:29:00,590
but I think we should deal with
it like two people who respect...

434
00:29:02,383 --> 00:29:04,010
I want it junked.

435
00:29:04,093 --> 00:29:06,012
Okay.

436
00:29:06,095 --> 00:29:08,473
Right now, I'm kind of like
a powder keg

437
00:29:08,598 --> 00:29:10,892
and you're the match.

438
00:29:10,975 --> 00:29:13,436
If you tell me to
junk it one more time...

439
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:16,898
Junk it now! You got that?

440
00:29:33,081 --> 00:29:35,458
That little sucker
just saved your life.

441
00:29:37,126 --> 00:29:40,088
Just junk it,
you miserable cuss.

442
00:30:01,734 --> 00:30:04,445
<i>We interrupt this
program to bring you breaking news.</i>

443
00:30:04,529 --> 00:30:08,366
<i>Champion City's best-known billionaire,
Lance Hunt, has disappeared.</i>

444
00:30:08,616 --> 00:30:11,744
<i>Police hope to enlist the help of
Captain Amazing in the search for Hunt,</i>

445
00:30:11,828 --> 00:30:16,124
<i>but have, so far, failed to contact
the city's beloved superhero.</i>

446
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:22,630
He makes a wonderful trophy,
don't you think?

447
00:30:24,507 --> 00:30:27,051
I really think we need
to talk about your plans here.

448
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:29,512
Here are my plans, Lancie.

449
00:30:30,012 --> 00:30:33,724
Tomorrow night,
I'm going to kill you.

450
00:30:33,808 --> 00:30:36,477
Right. That's the part that
really doesn't work for me.

451
00:30:36,561 --> 00:30:41,607
When the clock strikes 12:00,
cuckoo,cuckoo,

452
00:30:41,858 --> 00:30:43,151
you will be dead,

453
00:30:43,234 --> 00:30:46,779
and my city will be given
a new state of mind.

454
00:30:46,904 --> 00:30:48,948
Clearly you gotta go with
what you're comfortable with,

455
00:30:49,031 --> 00:30:51,784
but, I don't know, I just keep
coming back to this place.

456
00:30:51,868 --> 00:30:53,953
I'm spitballing here,
but maybe

457
00:30:54,036 --> 00:30:58,624
we release the captain
to the authorities.

458
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:01,210
I say that you're completely reformed.
Wink, wink.

459
00:31:01,294 --> 00:31:03,212
There is rejoicing
in the streets.

460
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:07,717
At that point, you do the whole
destruction of the city thing.

461
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,679
I mean, is it
a perfect plan? No.

462
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,557
And I think that's what
I like about it.

463
00:31:15,141 --> 00:31:17,018
Jeez. Okay.

464
00:31:18,227 --> 00:31:20,730
That's great.
Turn off the lights now.

465
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:24,066
It was just an idea!
Wait, I got a better one.

466
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:27,487
You let me live,
I am your sidekick.

467
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:31,824
I'm like Amazing Boy
or... Casanova?

468
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:34,744
Are you sure
Captain Amazing is in there?

469
00:31:34,827 --> 00:31:36,913
Yeah, I'm sure.
Let's go.

470
00:32:14,492 --> 00:32:16,327
Wait! Hear that?

471
00:32:16,994 --> 00:32:18,913
We must have hit
a trip wire.

472
00:32:19,288 --> 00:32:21,791
It could be a photon
eviscerator heating up.

473
00:32:21,874 --> 00:32:25,211
It could be a cybernetic atom scrambler.
They target moving objects.

474
00:32:25,294 --> 00:32:28,130
Sounds more like a heat-seeking
anthrax projection gun to me.

475
00:32:28,256 --> 00:32:30,258
Quickly, cover your mouth.
No, let's bolt!

476
00:32:30,341 --> 00:32:31,342
Don't move!
Don't breathe!

477
00:32:31,425 --> 00:32:32,385
Let's bolt!

478
00:32:32,468 --> 00:32:33,469
Don't move!
Don't breathe!

479
00:32:33,553 --> 00:32:34,554
Let's bolt!

480
00:32:36,681 --> 00:32:38,641
It's the sprinkler.

481
00:32:41,936 --> 00:32:45,523
Isn't that just fabu?
I'm positively soaked.

482
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:52,321
What do we got here?

483
00:32:52,405 --> 00:32:55,658
I think they're supposed to be
jive superheroes.

484
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,203
They made a big mistake
coming to Casanova's place.

485
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:05,084
What's so funny?

486
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:07,837
That's your power?
You have guns?

487
00:33:08,212 --> 00:33:10,298
Couldn't you be a little more
creative than that?

488
00:33:10,381 --> 00:33:12,341
Do forgive the impertinence,

489
00:33:12,508 --> 00:33:15,261
but what the devil does a
pistol have to do with disco?

490
00:33:15,344 --> 00:33:16,345
Weak.

491
00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:17,513
At best.

492
00:33:18,389 --> 00:33:21,934
Check out the guy with the pipe.
Are you the disco plumber?

493
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:24,812
There's no theme
at all here, mates.

494
00:33:24,895 --> 00:33:28,274
Buddy, if you're gonna carry a
chain, make it a gold chain.

495
00:33:28,357 --> 00:33:30,943
See what I'm saying? And that's
just off the top of my head.

496
00:33:31,027 --> 00:33:32,570
Yo, what's up, Tiger Lily?

497
00:33:32,653 --> 00:33:34,447
The top of your head, huh?

498
00:33:41,454 --> 00:33:44,332
VVe'll never get in there.
There are too many Disco Boys.

499
00:33:44,415 --> 00:33:47,460
Look, I'm telling you.
Amazing's in there. I saw him go in.

500
00:33:47,543 --> 00:33:49,754
There's never any evil trios,
are there?

501
00:33:49,837 --> 00:33:53,507
No, they've all got to travel
in gangs like little babies.

502
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,844
Maybe it's time
to level the playing field.

503
00:33:56,927 --> 00:33:57,928
H ow?

504
00:33:59,764 --> 00:34:01,390
I'm talking about recruiting.

505
00:34:01,474 --> 00:34:04,268
There's plenty of guys out there who
would kill to get in on our action.

506
00:34:04,352 --> 00:34:06,312
Plenty of posers,
you mean.

507
00:34:06,395 --> 00:34:07,688
Yeah, maybe a few.

508
00:34:07,772 --> 00:34:10,608
But there's got to be a couple
of guys out there, like,

509
00:34:10,691 --> 00:34:12,526
like a human torch.

510
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:16,697
Or like a guy who can shoot
stinging foam into your eyes

511
00:34:16,781 --> 00:34:18,532
or something like that.

512
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:22,161
There's the Sphinx,
of course.

513
00:34:22,244 --> 00:34:23,245
The what?

514
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:24,538
The Sphinx.

515
00:34:24,622 --> 00:34:25,706
I know this guy.

516
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:29,168
Big crime fighter from down south.
Big-league hitter down there.

517
00:34:29,251 --> 00:34:30,628
What's his power?

518
00:34:30,711 --> 00:34:32,088
He's terribly mysterious.

519
00:34:32,755 --> 00:34:34,715
That's it? That's his power?

520
00:34:34,799 --> 00:34:36,217
He's mysterious?

521
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,260
Terribly mysterious.

522
00:34:38,344 --> 00:34:40,012
Plus, he can, like,

523
00:34:40,346 --> 00:34:42,973
cut guns in half
with his mind.

524
00:34:43,099 --> 00:34:46,185
Really? I hadn't heard that.
Ithink.

525
00:34:46,435 --> 00:34:48,187
We'll have to track
this Sphinx guy down.

526
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:51,899
Meantime, I have an idea
where we can get another guy.

527
00:34:52,608 --> 00:34:55,486
I'm free for lunch tomorrow.
How about you?

528
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,197
Nothing I couldn't
move around.

529
00:35:09,834 --> 00:35:11,502
Why don't you guys
go on ahead?

530
00:35:11,585 --> 00:35:14,463
I gotta take care
of something.

531
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,799
Oh, I see.

532
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:29,437
Good cause there,
saving homeless animals.

533
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:31,147
Yeah.

534
00:35:32,648 --> 00:35:34,525
HO9 queen?

535
00:35:35,484 --> 00:35:36,527
What?

536
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,945
You're into motorcycles.

537
00:35:38,571 --> 00:35:41,240
Oh. No. Not really.

538
00:35:41,949 --> 00:35:43,659
'Cause I got a motorcycle.

539
00:35:44,827 --> 00:35:46,495
Yeah, what kind?

540
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:47,747
It's a Harley.

541
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:48,914
A Harley.

542
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:54,211
Compatible. It's a Harley compatible.
Basically, the same engineer.

543
00:35:55,463 --> 00:35:56,714
Look,

544
00:35:56,797 --> 00:35:59,633
I hope we're cool
about last night.

545
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:01,552
Last night?

546
00:36:01,635 --> 00:36:05,347
Like I said, I was kind of
in scary mode back there.

547
00:36:05,765 --> 00:36:09,351
Sometimes that comes off as a
little threatening or whatever.

548
00:36:09,894 --> 00:36:11,103
I don't find you threatening.

549
00:36:11,187 --> 00:36:14,607
You're very kind.

550
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:15,983
At all.

551
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:18,903
Listen, I still feel like

552
00:36:18,986 --> 00:36:22,364
I should make it up to you
somehow, just in some way.

553
00:36:23,324 --> 00:36:26,494
I should take you out to dinner or
something to make up for being so scary,

554
00:36:26,577 --> 00:36:27,620
or whatever.

555
00:36:27,703 --> 00:36:28,996
I'm really busy.

556
00:36:34,168 --> 00:36:35,544
Right.

557
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,881
Our little chess game
continues.

558
00:36:41,634 --> 00:36:42,635
Yeah?

559
00:36:42,718 --> 00:36:46,096
We're looking for the one
they call "The Invisible Boy."

560
00:36:47,014 --> 00:36:49,475
All my life,
I've been ignored by people.

561
00:36:49,558 --> 00:36:52,061
Finally, after years
of being overlooked,

562
00:36:52,144 --> 00:36:55,523
I found I have
the power to disappear.

563
00:36:56,065 --> 00:36:57,983
It's real ironic how
it happened 'cause...

564
00:36:58,067 --> 00:36:59,068
Can we come in?

565
00:37:00,361 --> 00:37:01,487
Yeah, sure. Come on.

566
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:02,613
Thank you.

567
00:37:02,696 --> 00:37:05,908
Dad, I'm going to my room
with three strange men.

568
00:37:08,285 --> 00:37:09,453
And that's pretty much it.

569
00:37:09,537 --> 00:37:12,248
So, let me get this straight.

570
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:15,000
You do have the ability
to become invisible?

571
00:37:15,584 --> 00:37:16,669
Yes.

572
00:37:16,752 --> 00:37:18,629
But you can't give us
a demonstration?

573
00:37:18,712 --> 00:37:22,758
No, I can only become invisible
when no one's watching.

574
00:37:23,759 --> 00:37:26,595
So, you're only invisible
to yourself?

575
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:31,100
No. If I look at myself,
I become visible again.

576
00:37:32,685 --> 00:37:37,690
So, you oan only become invisible when
absolutely nobody is watching you?

577
00:37:39,525 --> 00:37:41,026
Yes.

578
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,778
Do forgive our incredulity,

579
00:37:42,987 --> 00:37:47,575
but I'm wondering how you can be certain
you've achieved transparency at all?

580
00:37:49,535 --> 00:37:53,497
When you go invisible,
you can feel it.

581
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,126
I'm leaving.

582
00:37:57,209 --> 00:37:58,502
Thanks a lot.
It was nice to have met you.

583
00:37:58,586 --> 00:38:01,714
Wait, guys. Don't go. Where
you guys going? Don't go.

584
00:38:01,797 --> 00:38:03,757
Can I come?

585
00:38:05,259 --> 00:38:06,844
Look, no offense, kid,

586
00:38:06,927 --> 00:38:09,597
we're about to go up against a
really powerful supervillain,

587
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,724
Casanova Frankenstein.

588
00:38:11,807 --> 00:38:14,560
That means we gotta find a lot
of superheroes really quickly.

589
00:38:14,643 --> 00:38:17,021
And to tell you the truth, we have
no idea where to even start, so...

590
00:38:17,104 --> 00:38:18,898
I know tons of superheroes.

591
00:38:19,815 --> 00:38:21,025
I'm sure
you know a lot...

592
00:38:21,108 --> 00:38:22,109
No, no, no, seriously.

593
00:38:22,192 --> 00:38:25,404
I'm out there all the time at the
costume shops, martial arts stores

594
00:38:25,487 --> 00:38:27,448
talking to guys
and making connections.

595
00:38:27,531 --> 00:38:30,075
If you want to break in,
you gotta network,

596
00:38:30,701 --> 00:38:33,078
and I know how to network.

597
00:38:33,162 --> 00:38:34,455
Sorry, kid.

598
00:38:34,955 --> 00:38:36,165
Come on.

599
00:38:36,582 --> 00:38:38,667
Haven't you guys
ever been a kid?

600
00:38:39,501 --> 00:38:42,338
Haven't you guys
ever had a dream?

601
00:38:51,388 --> 00:38:53,933
Let me see, who else have I met?
There's the Pincher.

602
00:38:54,016 --> 00:38:55,017
"Pincher."

603
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,101
The Pickler.

604
00:38:56,185 --> 00:38:57,603
Princess Headbutt.

605
00:38:57,686 --> 00:38:59,688
White Flight and the Black Menace.
They work together.

606
00:38:59,772 --> 00:39:01,273
Slow down, slow down.

607
00:39:01,607 --> 00:39:04,026
Then there's,
Professor Pink Belly,

608
00:39:04,151 --> 00:39:06,528
and Lucky Pierre
and The French Tickler.

609
00:39:06,779 --> 00:39:08,572
"French Tickler."

610
00:39:08,989 --> 00:39:11,116
You've got all
their telephone numbers?

611
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,201
Yeah, most of them.

612
00:39:12,326 --> 00:39:14,620
We've got to figure out a way
to get them all in one place.

613
00:39:14,703 --> 00:39:16,163
That's quite right.

614
00:39:16,288 --> 00:39:17,748
Some kind of a tryout.

615
00:39:17,831 --> 00:39:19,333
Yes, a tryout.

616
00:39:20,042 --> 00:39:22,503
Throw in a barbecue and a couple
of kegs, they'll all show up.

617
00:39:22,586 --> 00:39:24,797
The mooch factor's pretty high
with this crowd.

618
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,882
A barbecue,
that's a good idea.

619
00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:31,470
What? Bugger all, it's the Spleen.
Play dead.

620
00:39:31,553 --> 00:39:32,513
Who's that?

621
00:39:32,596 --> 00:39:34,390
Turn your head.
Don't say anything.

622
00:39:49,238 --> 00:39:50,364
Hiya, fellas.

623
00:39:50,447 --> 00:39:53,826
VVord on the street is you're
looking for superheroes.

624
00:39:53,909 --> 00:39:54,910
Not really.

625
00:39:55,035 --> 00:39:56,245
Actually,
we're just leaving.

626
00:39:56,328 --> 00:39:58,330
Rotten luck.

627
00:39:58,414 --> 00:40:00,499
Oh, here we go.

628
00:40:00,582 --> 00:40:01,625
Perfect timing.

629
00:40:01,709 --> 00:40:02,751
That's for you.

630
00:40:03,961 --> 00:40:05,170
Hamburger, right?

631
00:40:05,254 --> 00:40:06,338
Yes, thank you.

632
00:40:06,463 --> 00:40:07,840
Enjoy.

633
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:11,719
Why are you guys always dissing me?
It hurts my feelings.

634
00:40:11,802 --> 00:40:14,054
I'm a superhero too.
I have powers.

635
00:40:14,138 --> 00:40:16,473
Really? Like what?

636
00:40:16,557 --> 00:40:17,933
So glad you asked.

637
00:40:18,017 --> 00:40:19,018
Oh, no.

638
00:40:19,101 --> 00:40:20,060
Excuse me.

639
00:40:20,144 --> 00:40:21,937
Excuse me. Excuse me.

640
00:40:24,314 --> 00:40:27,776
It all started when I was
just 13 years of age.

641
00:40:28,152 --> 00:40:29,737
One day, while walking
with some friends,

642
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,197
I accidentally cut the cheese.

643
00:40:32,322 --> 00:40:35,367
Well, in my
adolescent awkwardness,

644
00:40:35,451 --> 00:40:38,954
I blamed it on an old gypsy woman
who happened to be passing by.

645
00:40:39,163 --> 00:40:41,165
Big mistake!

646
00:40:41,665 --> 00:40:44,585
The gypsy woman placed a curse
upon my head.

647
00:40:44,668 --> 00:40:46,545
Because I smelled it,

648
00:40:46,628 --> 00:40:51,133
she decreed I would forevermore
be he who dealt it!

649
00:40:51,925 --> 00:40:52,968
Let me illustrate.

650
00:40:53,052 --> 00:40:54,053
No,
you don't have to.

651
00:40:54,136 --> 00:40:56,096
It's not necessary, really.

652
00:40:57,639 --> 00:41:00,017
Let's see.

653
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,353
Distance: 7 meters.

654
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,148
Air speed: normal.

655
00:41:07,024 --> 00:41:09,026
Compensate for
air conditioning.

656
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,112
Pull my fingers.

657
00:41:12,196 --> 00:41:13,197
SHOVELERI Don't do it.

658
00:41:13,697 --> 00:41:15,657
Oh, dear God.

659
00:41:16,366 --> 00:41:19,369
S.B.D.!

660
00:41:27,461 --> 00:41:29,338
Silent but deadly.

661
00:41:29,421 --> 00:41:31,006
That's good shooting.

662
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,132
That was amazing!

663
00:41:32,216 --> 00:41:34,676
It's disgusting.
Don't encourage him.

664
00:41:35,803 --> 00:41:39,014
You guys are recruiting
for superheroes.

665
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,642
Where you holding
the tryouts?

666
00:41:41,725 --> 00:41:43,102
We don't know yet,

667
00:41:43,185 --> 00:41:46,021
as soon as we figure that out,
we'll get in touch immediately.

668
00:41:46,688 --> 00:41:51,026
Bet we'd get a big turnout if we did
it somewhere with a swimming pool.

669
00:41:51,693 --> 00:41:53,821
Oh, no. No, no, no.

670
00:41:54,154 --> 00:41:57,699
Absolutely not. Nope. No.

671
00:42:03,872 --> 00:42:05,290
I don't deserve this.

672
00:42:05,374 --> 00:42:06,500
I know.

673
00:42:08,293 --> 00:42:10,420
A lot of other men
I could have married.

674
00:42:10,504 --> 00:42:11,713
I understand.

675
00:42:11,797 --> 00:42:16,009
If one person vomits in my
pool, I'm gonna divorce you.

676
00:42:16,552 --> 00:42:18,178
That's fair.

677
00:42:18,387 --> 00:42:20,347
Come on, kids!

678
00:42:26,895 --> 00:42:28,647
State your name and power.

679
00:42:29,064 --> 00:42:30,566
I am the Waffler.

680
00:42:30,649 --> 00:42:33,819
With my griddle ofjustice,
I bash the enemy in the head

681
00:42:33,902 --> 00:42:35,737
or I burn them like so.

682
00:42:36,905 --> 00:42:38,866
Don't do that.

683
00:42:38,949 --> 00:42:43,078
I also have my truth
syrup, which is low fat.

684
00:42:43,162 --> 00:42:45,164
And I've been working
on a theme song.

685
00:42:45,247 --> 00:42:48,083
<i>Waffle man,
I am the Waffler</i>

686
00:42:48,167 --> 00:42:51,545
<i>Golden crispy,
bad guys are history</i>

687
00:42:53,046 --> 00:42:55,257
And I'm running.
Just think about it.

688
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,718
Do you have a health plan?
Maybe dental? Eye?

689
00:42:57,801 --> 00:42:58,802
Next.

690
00:42:58,886 --> 00:43:01,889
Hi. I am Pencilhead.

691
00:43:02,431 --> 00:43:04,850
And I am
Son of Pencilhead!

692
00:43:05,142 --> 00:43:06,143
We erase crime.

693
00:43:06,226 --> 00:43:07,269
Two generations of...

694
00:43:07,352 --> 00:43:09,021
Right.
Yes, thank you.

695
00:43:09,104 --> 00:43:10,105
Did I do all right?

696
00:43:10,189 --> 00:43:12,024
Yeah, I think they liked us.

697
00:43:12,107 --> 00:43:14,151
Now, say...

698
00:43:14,401 --> 00:43:16,570
I'm the Ballerina Man.

699
00:43:19,114 --> 00:43:21,241
I don't need to see that.

700
00:43:30,626 --> 00:43:31,668
Thanks.

701
00:43:32,294 --> 00:43:33,629
lam...
Hey!

702
00:43:33,921 --> 00:43:35,964
You copied me.
You copied me.

703
00:43:36,048 --> 00:43:37,382
Did not!
Liar!

704
00:43:37,466 --> 00:43:40,052
Ladies, now let's play nicely.

705
00:43:51,063 --> 00:43:52,814
I'd say there's potential.

706
00:43:53,649 --> 00:43:58,237
I be the Bullfighter.
I fight the bull!

707
00:43:58,737 --> 00:44:01,531
Greetings, fellow crime fighters.
I am Radio Man.

708
00:44:02,324 --> 00:44:03,408
I am Squeegeeman.

709
00:44:03,492 --> 00:44:04,660
Do you sense its power?

710
00:44:04,743 --> 00:44:05,744
Yes.

711
00:44:05,827 --> 00:44:10,415
P.M.S. Avenger. I work 4 days a month.
Is there a problem with that?

712
00:44:10,624 --> 00:44:12,084
No.
No.

713
00:44:12,167 --> 00:44:13,126
Whatever you say.

714
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:14,294
We'll get back to you.

715
00:44:14,378 --> 00:44:15,420
Quite all right.

716
00:44:15,504 --> 00:44:16,505
Whatever.

717
00:44:16,588 --> 00:44:18,173
Okay, that's it.

718
00:44:29,226 --> 00:44:31,353
That was
a complete waste of time.

719
00:44:31,687 --> 00:44:33,730
Like so many things we do.

720
00:44:35,857 --> 00:44:39,444
Hi. Hi, you guys.
Am I too late to try out?

721
00:44:39,528 --> 00:44:41,488
What time is it?
I don't have a watch on.

722
00:44:41,571 --> 00:44:45,659
Yeah. Sorry. You'll have to pretend
to be a superhero somewhere else.

723
00:44:45,826 --> 00:44:48,078
Really? I see.

724
00:44:48,787 --> 00:44:50,706
That's fine.

725
00:45:11,226 --> 00:45:12,728
Look out!

726
00:45:14,771 --> 00:45:16,231
Look out!

727
00:45:26,908 --> 00:45:29,786
I guess I'll just have to
take my ball and go home.

728
00:45:30,162 --> 00:45:32,247
No. You can't go.
Miss, please.

729
00:45:32,331 --> 00:45:34,249
Where you going?
That was cool.

730
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:36,043
Stop her.
Wait.

731
00:45:36,335 --> 00:45:38,712
Hold on. Stop her.
Settle down.

732
00:45:38,795 --> 00:45:40,547
That was great.

733
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:42,090
We might be able to squeeze in
one more interview.

734
00:45:42,174 --> 00:45:44,926
Yes, seeing as how you schlepped
your ball all this way.

735
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:46,053
Appreciate that. Thanks.

736
00:45:46,136 --> 00:45:47,596
You're really good.

737
00:45:47,846 --> 00:45:49,931
What's up?
I'm the Spleen.

738
00:45:50,474 --> 00:45:52,851
I'm the Bowler.
How you doing?

739
00:45:52,934 --> 00:45:54,561
You're very attractive.

740
00:45:56,229 --> 00:45:57,481
That's because
it's ambrosia.

741
00:45:57,564 --> 00:46:00,567
Why don't you tell us
a little bit about yourself.

742
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:03,153
Help us understand why
we should choose you

743
00:46:03,236 --> 00:46:05,280
over all the other
qualified applicants.

744
00:46:05,364 --> 00:46:06,365
What other
qualified applicants?

745
00:46:06,448 --> 00:46:08,158
Eddie, please.

746
00:46:09,242 --> 00:46:11,953
Start at the top.
Where did you get your powers?

747
00:46:12,829 --> 00:46:14,831
I got my powers
from my father.

748
00:46:15,457 --> 00:46:16,792
Okay. Who's he?

749
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:19,169
Have you ever heard of
Carmine the Bowler?

750
00:46:19,252 --> 00:46:20,545
Have we ever heard...

751
00:46:20,629 --> 00:46:24,508
Cor blimey, don't tell us
you're the Bowler's daughter.

752
00:46:24,591 --> 00:46:27,844
I seem to remember there being a
little controversy around his death.

753
00:46:27,928 --> 00:46:29,638
That's right. The police
said it was an accident.

754
00:46:29,721 --> 00:46:32,849
He'd oome home late one night
and fell down an elevator shaft

755
00:46:32,933 --> 00:46:34,393
onto some bullets.

756
00:46:34,476 --> 00:46:37,604
I've always suspected
a bit of foul play.

757
00:46:37,687 --> 00:46:39,314
As have I.

758
00:46:39,731 --> 00:46:41,650
So now daddy's little girl
is all grown up,

759
00:46:41,733 --> 00:46:43,985
looking for a little revenge,
is that it?

760
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:46,822
Yeah, that is it.
Is there a problem with that?

761
00:46:46,947 --> 00:46:47,948
Why don't you tell me?

762
00:46:48,031 --> 00:46:49,074
I don't know. You tell me.

763
00:46:49,157 --> 00:46:55,664
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?

764
00:46:59,251 --> 00:47:01,420
All right. You've seen
what I can do.

765
00:47:01,503 --> 00:47:03,588
You either want to use
my talents or you don't.

766
00:47:03,672 --> 00:47:06,258
If you don't, I seek another
cabal, and we do it that way.

767
00:47:06,341 --> 00:47:08,468
We need you.
We definitely need you.

768
00:47:08,552 --> 00:47:09,553
Indeed.

769
00:47:09,761 --> 00:47:11,221
Bowler... Evelyn...

770
00:47:11,555 --> 00:47:13,598
Carol.

771
00:47:13,682 --> 00:47:16,560
Will you join
our little ragtag trio?

772
00:47:16,935 --> 00:47:18,478
I think you mean quartet...

773
00:47:18,562 --> 00:47:21,273
What are you talking about?
There's five of us.

774
00:47:22,274 --> 00:47:26,111
Nobody's green lit new
memberships, sojustchfllout

775
00:47:27,195 --> 00:47:29,614
Granted, you've got a good arm.
I'll give you that.

776
00:47:29,698 --> 00:47:31,366
But we're in a lead cad...

777
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:32,868
Cadre.

778
00:47:32,951 --> 00:47:34,244
You're in.
Welcome aboard.

779
00:47:34,327 --> 00:47:36,163
Guys, would you...

780
00:47:36,246 --> 00:47:38,206
What? What's the problem?

781
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:39,875
Welcome.

782
00:47:40,292 --> 00:47:41,376
<i>SHOVELER'. What'?</i>

783
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:44,212
Nothing. No problem.
Welcome aboard.

784
00:47:53,346 --> 00:47:55,265
So what's up? Are
Spleen and I on the team or not?

785
00:47:55,348 --> 00:47:58,101
In my opinion, which used
to matter around here,

786
00:47:58,185 --> 00:47:59,811
we shouldn't be
flinging memberships

787
00:47:59,895 --> 00:48:02,647
at every guy who puts together a
pair of matching gloves and boots.

788
00:48:02,731 --> 00:48:05,609
You guys just be sure to jump
in when the action starts.

789
00:48:05,692 --> 00:48:07,527
You do your share,
we'll keep you around.

790
00:48:07,611 --> 00:48:08,612
Maybe.

791
00:48:08,737 --> 00:48:11,698
So you're a British man who converted
to Islam like Cat Stevens?

792
00:48:11,781 --> 00:48:17,579
No. Until the early part of this century,
India was part of the British Empire,

793
00:48:17,829 --> 00:48:20,123
whose government there
was called the British Raj,

794
00:48:20,207 --> 00:48:22,501
after the Hindi word
for "sovereignty."

795
00:48:22,584 --> 00:48:23,627
Furthermore...

796
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,170
Wait. So sorry. What?

797
00:48:26,129 --> 00:48:27,339
Dad.

798
00:48:27,422 --> 00:48:29,925
No, he's not
a commie nor a fruit.

799
00:48:30,592 --> 00:48:32,052
Sorry.

800
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:35,305
His ignorance embarrasses me.

801
00:48:35,388 --> 00:48:39,518
Sorry, but am I to understand
you've inserted your father's skull

802
00:48:39,601 --> 00:48:41,561
inside of that ball
for bowling?

803
00:48:41,645 --> 00:48:44,147
No. The guy at
the pro shop did it.

804
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,860
That was Casanova's limo.

805
00:48:48,944 --> 00:48:52,113
You bet your sweet bippy it was.
Let's turn this suoker around!

806
00:48:52,197 --> 00:48:54,366
He's probably got
Amazing in there.

807
00:48:58,620 --> 00:48:59,746
Here we go.

808
00:48:59,829 --> 00:49:01,831
I feel carsick.

809
00:49:01,915 --> 00:49:03,041
Great.

810
00:49:04,584 --> 00:49:08,129
So tell me, who oan we count on
seeing at my banquet tomorrow?

811
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,757
All the top gangs
are gonna be there, Cas.

812
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,802
They want to know
what you got up your sleeve.

813
00:49:16,012 --> 00:49:19,975
Mr. Casanova,
I think we're being followed.

814
00:49:36,992 --> 00:49:39,160
Let us say hello.

815
00:49:46,334 --> 00:49:47,669
What's he doing?

816
00:49:48,003 --> 00:49:50,171
He's either very smart
or very dumb.

817
00:50:06,271 --> 00:50:07,522
Hello.

818
00:50:07,772 --> 00:50:10,609
I would like a double burger
with the large fries.

819
00:50:11,026 --> 00:50:13,486
Do you boys
want something to drink?

820
00:50:14,988 --> 00:50:17,824
We think you did something
bad to Captain Amazing.

821
00:50:17,949 --> 00:50:19,909
We would like you
to tell us where he is.

822
00:50:19,993 --> 00:50:23,204
Captain who? This name does
not ring any bells with me.

823
00:50:23,622 --> 00:50:26,041
I don't like your tone,
Frankenpuss.

824
00:50:26,708 --> 00:50:28,585
Do yourself a favor
and don't punch my clock.

825
00:50:28,668 --> 00:50:31,212
I'm a Pantera's box
you do not want to open.

826
00:50:31,379 --> 00:50:32,631
It is Pandora.

827
00:50:32,714 --> 00:50:35,175
Please don't correct me.

828
00:50:35,258 --> 00:50:36,509
It sickens me.

829
00:50:36,593 --> 00:50:38,970
You guys never learn, do you?

830
00:50:39,346 --> 00:50:42,057
Apparently we don't, ass.

831
00:50:42,891 --> 00:50:43,892
I know you.

832
00:50:43,975 --> 00:50:45,143
You don't know me.

833
00:50:45,935 --> 00:50:47,479
You knew my father.
Sal.

834
00:50:47,562 --> 00:50:48,938
Carmine.
Carmine.

835
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:52,067
Carmine? The Bowler?

836
00:50:52,192 --> 00:50:53,151
Yep.

837
00:50:53,234 --> 00:50:54,653
You're Baby Bowler?

838
00:50:54,736 --> 00:50:55,862
Is that a problem?

839
00:50:55,945 --> 00:50:57,030
Hello.

840
00:50:57,822 --> 00:51:00,408
I'm the guy that gave
your daddy the shaft.

841
00:51:01,076 --> 00:51:03,620
This is the last time
I'm going to ask you:

842
00:51:04,454 --> 00:51:05,997
Where is Captain Amazing?

843
00:51:06,081 --> 00:51:08,833
And a diet Pepsi
with a little bit of ice.

844
00:51:14,422 --> 00:51:16,341
Hey,Shove!

845
00:51:22,806 --> 00:51:24,683
Boys, let's go.

846
00:51:26,935 --> 00:51:28,603
Fork yourself!

847
00:51:33,942 --> 00:51:35,276
Pull!

848
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:55,255
Come on, Roy,
let's get out of here.

849
00:51:55,338 --> 00:51:57,465
Come on, Furious! Let's go!

850
00:51:58,383 --> 00:52:00,510
People who live
in glass houses, shouldn't.

851
00:52:00,593 --> 00:52:02,470
Because this is what happens!

852
00:52:04,139 --> 00:52:05,515
Come on!
That's enough!

853
00:52:05,598 --> 00:52:07,517
Come on. Get out of the way.

854
00:52:09,561 --> 00:52:11,604
The roof is on fire! The roof!

855
00:52:11,688 --> 00:52:14,816
The roof is on fire!

856
00:52:14,899 --> 00:52:18,611
We don't need no water.
We don't need no water.

857
00:52:19,738 --> 00:52:21,448
Here comes Daddy.

858
00:52:34,878 --> 00:52:36,421
Go, go, go!

859
00:52:55,815 --> 00:52:58,985
I would like to make a toast
to our first straightout victory.

860
00:52:59,068 --> 00:53:00,445
Stunning victory.
Here, here.

861
00:53:00,528 --> 00:53:02,363
The relationship you have
with your mother

862
00:53:02,447 --> 00:53:04,449
affects every other
dynamic in your life.

863
00:53:04,532 --> 00:53:06,701
What? What?
It's true, quite true.

864
00:53:07,702 --> 00:53:11,456
Yes, a father's role is vital in a
child's life as well. I know this.

865
00:53:11,664 --> 00:53:13,666
No, I'm not disrespecting you.

866
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:17,837
You have to respect me too. You have to
allow me to have conversations in a bar

867
00:53:17,921 --> 00:53:20,006
and talk to my new friends.

868
00:53:20,089 --> 00:53:22,217
Anyway, I'm an adult now.

869
00:53:23,384 --> 00:53:24,969
Do you want to go
back in the bag?

870
00:53:25,053 --> 00:53:28,181
Is that how we're gonna do it now?
You make the rules.

871
00:53:28,598 --> 00:53:30,558
If you don't zip it...

872
00:53:35,146 --> 00:53:37,106
Sheesh.

873
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:40,860
I was going to say that
parents can be quite problematic.

874
00:53:40,944 --> 00:53:42,278
Tell me about it.

875
00:53:46,908 --> 00:53:50,954
There's not enough beer in the world.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

876
00:53:51,037 --> 00:53:53,373
It's okay. It's okay.
Listen.

877
00:53:53,456 --> 00:53:55,375
You've got to live
in truth. Correct?

878
00:53:55,458 --> 00:53:58,253
The woman's a tiger.

879
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,802
Barkeep, another round

880
00:54:05,885 --> 00:54:09,764
for my sweet team
of superfriends.

881
00:54:09,931 --> 00:54:12,725
Barkeep, another round
for the super,

882
00:54:14,018 --> 00:54:16,104
super bellies.

883
00:54:17,438 --> 00:54:19,315
That's what's so cool
about this team:

884
00:54:19,399 --> 00:54:23,319
Everyone has their own powers for
all these different sfluafions.

885
00:54:23,611 --> 00:54:25,029
Pull my finger.

886
00:54:31,452 --> 00:54:32,537
What?

887
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,622
I was just thinking.

888
00:54:34,789 --> 00:54:38,293
I was wondering when we might
see your super power.

889
00:54:40,628 --> 00:54:43,882
It'll happen, kid.
Don't worry.

890
00:54:45,884 --> 00:54:48,928
I say, "sabatage."
"Sabatage?"

891
00:54:49,012 --> 00:54:51,180
The Shoveler
is hammered!

892
00:54:51,264 --> 00:54:53,600
The Shoveler is hammered!

893
00:55:02,066 --> 00:55:03,359
So what's the name
of this team?

894
00:55:03,443 --> 00:55:04,611
How about the Super Squad?

895
00:55:04,694 --> 00:55:08,156
How about the Six Dead Guys
in Their Stupid Costumes?

896
00:55:08,531 --> 00:55:11,743
No. The Magnificent Dead Guys.
How about that?

897
00:55:11,826 --> 00:55:14,078
What about
the Legendary Superfreaks?

898
00:55:14,203 --> 00:55:16,789
Way too positive.
They totaled our car.

899
00:55:26,507 --> 00:55:27,800
Ready?

900
00:55:27,884 --> 00:55:28,968
Ready!

901
00:55:30,678 --> 00:55:31,679
TONY P; Aim.

902
00:55:31,763 --> 00:55:32,889
Aim!

903
00:55:34,182 --> 00:55:35,433
I love you!

904
00:55:36,351 --> 00:55:37,352
Fire!

905
00:55:46,486 --> 00:55:49,697
Six Very Nearly Dead Guys With
a Temporary Reprieve.

906
00:55:49,781 --> 00:55:51,282
That's it. That's your name.

907
00:55:51,366 --> 00:55:52,742
Six Jive Turkeys.

908
00:55:52,825 --> 00:55:53,826
Dig, man?

909
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:55,203
Yeah! Dig, man!

910
00:55:55,286 --> 00:55:59,666
That's your name.
Kill you later, superlosers!

911
00:56:04,712 --> 00:56:08,257
Criminy.
You're the Sphinx.

912
00:56:08,383 --> 00:56:10,134
And you are fools.

913
00:56:10,802 --> 00:56:12,261
Tonight

914
00:56:12,553 --> 00:56:14,305
you proved

915
00:56:15,014 --> 00:56:17,058
your inexperience.

916
00:56:17,392 --> 00:56:20,812
The wise man knows
that he is weakest

917
00:56:21,354 --> 00:56:23,731
when he thinks himself strong.

918
00:56:23,898 --> 00:56:25,024
Whoa.

919
00:56:25,108 --> 00:56:26,943
This is serious.

920
00:56:27,568 --> 00:56:29,070
Terribly mysterious.

921
00:56:29,237 --> 00:56:31,197
Casanova Frankenstein

922
00:56:31,406 --> 00:56:33,157
is no ordinary villain.

923
00:56:33,574 --> 00:56:35,034
To fight him,

924
00:56:35,535 --> 00:56:38,913
you must have
extraordinary skill.

925
00:56:38,997 --> 00:56:41,457
Thank you for that
little piece of information.

926
00:56:41,541 --> 00:56:43,209
I wouldn't have thought...

927
00:56:43,292 --> 00:56:44,669
Excuse me!

928
00:56:44,752 --> 00:56:46,337
Does anybody have any manners?

929
00:56:46,421 --> 00:56:47,463
I don't know. Do I?

930
00:56:47,547 --> 00:56:48,715
I don't know. Do you?
Do I?

931
00:56:48,798 --> 00:56:51,592
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?

932
00:56:51,676 --> 00:56:53,511
I don't know. You tell me.
Do I mind what? Do I?

933
00:56:53,594 --> 00:56:54,846
SHence!

934
00:56:54,929 --> 00:56:57,890
We'll have to
separate you two.

935
00:56:57,974 --> 00:57:00,727
Is that what you want?
You want to be separated?

936
00:57:00,977 --> 00:57:02,395
He started it.

937
00:57:03,604 --> 00:57:07,775
You must be
like the wolf pack,

938
00:57:08,484 --> 00:57:11,112
not like the six pack.

939
00:57:11,195 --> 00:57:12,947
Teamwork. Yes!

940
00:57:13,114 --> 00:57:16,784
You were not ready to face
so great an enemy.

941
00:57:17,368 --> 00:57:21,581
Not until you have vanquished
the enemy within yourselves.

942
00:57:21,998 --> 00:57:22,999
Yes!

943
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:25,043
It's cool, isn't it?

944
00:57:25,168 --> 00:57:29,630
It goes right up to the point
of being, like, confusing.

945
00:57:30,089 --> 00:57:33,718
It's leadership.
It's what we've been missing.

946
00:57:34,135 --> 00:57:36,012
Yes, I quite agree.

947
00:57:36,637 --> 00:57:40,224
Sphinx, will you guide our motley
little gang of men at arms?

948
00:57:40,308 --> 00:57:43,019
Hey! Wait a minute.

949
00:57:43,102 --> 00:57:45,021
Are you serious? Come on.

950
00:57:45,354 --> 00:57:47,315
Will you shape us,
mold us?

951
00:57:47,398 --> 00:57:50,359
Please unify us
and make us whole.

952
00:57:50,443 --> 00:57:52,320
To learn my teachings,

953
00:57:52,904 --> 00:57:55,490
I must first teach you

954
00:57:56,282 --> 00:57:57,492
how to learn.

955
00:58:09,003 --> 00:58:11,422
Learn to hide your strikes
from your opponent,

956
00:58:11,506 --> 00:58:14,634
and you'll more easily
strike his hide.

957
00:58:24,143 --> 00:58:25,978
How many weapons do you wield?

958
00:58:26,062 --> 00:58:27,146
Just one, Sphinx.

959
00:58:27,605 --> 00:58:30,983
No. The fist, the knee,
the elbow, the head!

960
00:58:31,192 --> 00:58:32,819
You must lash out
with every limb

961
00:58:32,902 --> 00:58:35,488
like the octopus
who plays the drums.

962
00:58:40,368 --> 00:58:42,120
Why am I doing this again?

963
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:44,622
When you can balance
a tack hammer on your head,

964
00:58:44,705 --> 00:58:47,875
you will head off your foes
with a balanced attack.

965
00:58:48,835 --> 00:58:51,754
And why am I wearing the
watermelon on my feet?

966
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:01,973
I don't remember
telling you to do that.

967
00:59:04,058 --> 00:59:07,186
Wait a minute. Wait. Wait.

968
00:59:26,038 --> 00:59:28,082
I believe in my powers.

969
00:59:28,374 --> 00:59:30,585
I believe in my powers.

970
00:59:30,918 --> 00:59:34,088
I believe in the powers
of my teammates.

971
00:59:34,422 --> 00:59:37,466
I believe in the powers
of my teammates.

972
00:59:37,758 --> 00:59:42,138
I trust in my powers.

973
00:59:42,305 --> 00:59:45,141
I trust in the powers
of my teammates.

974
00:59:45,433 --> 00:59:49,061
I trust in the powers
of my teammates.

975
00:59:50,771 --> 00:59:53,608
This team must learn
to work together

976
00:59:53,691 --> 00:59:57,862
or, mark my words,
it will be torn apart!

977
00:59:59,447 --> 01:00:02,158
Now, gather round.

978
01:00:03,075 --> 01:00:05,203
Gather round.
Embrace one another.

979
01:00:05,536 --> 01:00:08,664
Gather round.
Embrace one another quickly.

980
01:00:08,748 --> 01:00:10,041
Roy.

981
01:00:13,961 --> 01:00:16,297
Why do you stand aside
while the others practice?

982
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,174
"Practice?"

983
01:00:18,466 --> 01:00:20,801
That's not practicing.
That's group hugging.

984
01:00:20,885 --> 01:00:23,512
We should be busting in
on Casanova right now.

985
01:00:23,804 --> 01:00:28,309
He who questions training, only
trains himself at asking questions.

986
01:00:30,561 --> 01:00:31,979
What?

987
01:00:37,735 --> 01:00:39,946
Who was looking for
the pinking shears?

988
01:00:40,029 --> 01:00:41,072
Oh, that was me.

989
01:00:41,155 --> 01:00:45,826
Yes, work well on
your new costumes, my friends.

990
01:00:46,661 --> 01:00:49,163
For when you care
for what is outside,

991
01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:52,583
what is inside cares for you.

992
01:00:53,084 --> 01:00:54,627
The clock is ticking here.

993
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:58,256
Are we gonna sew dresses all day
or are we gonna rescue Amazing?

994
01:00:58,339 --> 01:00:59,924
I need a thimble.
Does anybody...

995
01:01:00,007 --> 01:01:01,300
Patience, my son.

996
01:01:01,384 --> 01:01:03,469
To summon your power for
the conflict to come,

997
01:01:03,552 --> 01:01:06,681
you must first have power
over that which conflicts you.

998
01:01:07,014 --> 01:01:10,643
Am I the only one who finds these
sayings just a little formulaic?

999
01:01:10,851 --> 01:01:13,437
"If you want to push something
down, you have to pull it up."

1000
01:01:13,521 --> 01:01:15,481
"If you want to go left,
you have to go right."

1001
01:01:15,564 --> 01:01:20,278
Your temper is very quick, but until
you learn to master your rage...

1002
01:01:20,361 --> 01:01:22,863
Your rage will
become your master?

1003
01:01:24,031 --> 01:01:25,700
That's what you
were gonna say, right?

1004
01:01:25,783 --> 01:01:27,159
Right?

1005
01:01:27,243 --> 01:01:28,536
Not necessarily.

1006
01:01:29,203 --> 01:01:31,289
That's it. I'm out of here.

1007
01:01:31,664 --> 01:01:35,126
Thanks for all the advice, Mr. Misterioso,
but it's time to get busy with it.

1008
01:01:35,209 --> 01:01:36,294
Come on, Eddie.
Let's go.

1009
01:01:36,377 --> 01:01:37,336
No, Roy.

1010
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:38,796
I think he's getting results.

1011
01:01:38,879 --> 01:01:40,673
Yeah, and the biggest one is
that we're all out of here.

1012
01:01:40,756 --> 01:01:44,302
Come on, Jeff. Let's peel some wheelies.
Let's go.

1013
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,013
I don't want to leave
the Sphinx.

1014
01:01:47,096 --> 01:01:48,973
Okay, how about
the rest of you?

1015
01:01:49,056 --> 01:01:51,642
Do you want to play Suzie
Homemaker with Captain Conundrum

1016
01:01:51,726 --> 01:01:53,853
or do you want
to be superheroes?

1017
01:02:01,444 --> 01:02:05,489
Okay, I don't need a compass to
tell rne which way the wind shines.

1018
01:02:06,365 --> 01:02:08,242
Roy, wait.
Let's talk about this.

1019
01:02:08,326 --> 01:02:10,077
No, let's not talk about it!

1020
01:02:10,161 --> 01:02:12,496
You want to sit here, make Halloween
outfits with Little Red Riding Hood

1021
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:15,082
or you want to
take care of business?

1022
01:02:17,376 --> 01:02:21,130
Well, I guess from now on I
ride in a wolf pack of one.

1023
01:02:30,097 --> 01:02:31,307
We should go after him.

1024
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:33,434
He's okay. Just let him go.
He's a baby.

1025
01:02:33,517 --> 01:02:35,603
We've never gone
into battle without him.

1026
01:02:35,686 --> 01:02:37,271
If you love him so much,
why don't you marry him?

1027
01:02:37,355 --> 01:02:39,148
I don't know. Why don't you marry him?
VVhy don't you?

1028
01:02:39,231 --> 01:02:40,733
<i>Whv dfilfltyou'?
WW fimftyou'?</i>

1029
01:02:40,816 --> 01:02:42,693
Bowler, Shoveler, please!

1030
01:02:42,777 --> 01:02:47,698
Sphinx, what wisdom can you give
us in this, our most clouded hour?

1031
01:02:47,782 --> 01:02:49,492
Yeah, what do we do?

1032
01:02:50,826 --> 01:02:53,287
The loss of manpower
can be replaced

1033
01:02:53,371 --> 01:02:55,498
by the addition
of firepower.

1034
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:01,337
Well, I won't use guns. I've
been crystal clear aboutthat

1035
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:02,671
He won't even
use a knife.

1036
01:03:02,755 --> 01:03:05,216
You're not going to start
with that again, are you?

1037
01:03:05,299 --> 01:03:07,301
Casanova will have
many weapons.

1038
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:12,223
To beat him, you will have to have
more than forks and flatulence.

1039
01:03:16,602 --> 01:03:18,062
Heller.

1040
01:03:25,528 --> 01:03:29,323
"Dr. A. Heller:
weapons designer,

1041
01:03:29,532 --> 01:03:32,326
"innovator, inventor,
world changer."

1042
01:03:53,764 --> 01:03:56,142
Why does he live in a
deserted amusement park?

1043
01:03:56,225 --> 01:03:58,310
Because he's
an eccentric genius.

1044
01:03:58,477 --> 01:04:01,272
I'll take point. You two flank.
Let's triangulate.

1045
01:04:01,355 --> 01:04:03,107
Equilateral or isosceles?

1046
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:04,316
Just go.

1047
01:04:20,708 --> 01:04:23,127
Who would want
to rent a chicken?

1048
01:04:25,212 --> 01:04:28,340
This is weird in here.
It's scary and weird.

1049
01:04:39,768 --> 01:04:41,520
Oh, there's
another chicken.

1050
01:04:41,604 --> 01:04:43,606
Crazy chicken world.

1051
01:04:55,117 --> 01:04:56,452
Dr. Heller?

1052
01:04:58,412 --> 01:05:00,080
We come in peace.

1053
01:05:01,665 --> 01:05:02,833
ShovelHead?

1054
01:05:02,917 --> 01:05:05,586
The Shoveler. Yes, sir.
We met at the old folks' home.

1055
01:05:05,669 --> 01:05:08,756
Of course.
Fork Man?

1056
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:12,468
I'm the Spleen. If you want to know
what my power is, pull my finger.

1057
01:05:12,551 --> 01:05:14,678
Please, don't!
Don't, sir. Don't.

1058
01:05:14,762 --> 01:05:18,766
Dr. Heller, we're on a mission.
We've come for weapons.

1059
01:05:18,849 --> 01:05:22,186
Shouldn't we see a diploma
or something first?

1060
01:05:22,269 --> 01:05:25,981
You came to the right place,
baby. Step into my office.

1061
01:05:29,777 --> 01:05:31,779
Where are your friends?

1062
01:05:33,239 --> 01:05:34,448
What friends?

1063
01:05:35,115 --> 01:05:39,537
Your friends. I thought you guys
were in a olub or something.

1064
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:42,122
You mean a team? A Super Team?

1065
01:05:42,206 --> 01:05:43,207
Yeah.

1066
01:05:43,290 --> 01:05:47,878
Apparently, it's now the Super
Sphinx Team or something.

1067
01:05:48,128 --> 01:05:49,421
You had a falling out?

1068
01:05:49,505 --> 01:05:50,965
Yeah, kind of.

1069
01:05:54,051 --> 01:05:56,011
Is it okay if I just
have the coffee?

1070
01:05:56,095 --> 01:05:57,054
I'm not very hungry.

1071
01:05:57,137 --> 01:05:58,430
Sure.

1072
01:06:01,392 --> 01:06:02,643
HEY,

1073
01:06:04,603 --> 01:06:06,689
what time do you get off work?

1074
01:06:07,106 --> 01:06:10,276
Half hour. Why?

1075
01:06:11,402 --> 01:06:14,488
No reason. I was just thinking
maybe I could...

1076
01:06:14,572 --> 01:06:16,907
It might be a good idea
if I walked you home.

1077
01:06:16,991 --> 01:06:19,535
The city's been
real, real dangerous

1078
01:06:19,618 --> 01:06:21,662
since Amazing went M.I.A.

1079
01:06:25,165 --> 01:06:27,293
I've been working on
some jujitsu moves that...

1080
01:06:27,376 --> 01:06:31,463
Just probably be safer on
everybody's part if...

1081
01:06:31,547 --> 01:06:36,635
Also, it would be great
to just walk you home.

1082
01:06:38,762 --> 01:06:40,055
Sure.

1083
01:06:45,019 --> 01:06:48,856
This will even things up
a little bit. What is it?

1084
01:06:49,189 --> 01:06:50,357
Look at this!

1085
01:06:51,567 --> 01:06:52,776
Don't point at me.

1086
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:55,613
You're gonna kill somebody.

1087
01:06:55,821 --> 01:06:58,741
Listen, everything here
is nonlethal.

1088
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:01,785
"Nonlethal"? What?

1089
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:04,622
I don't make anything
that's deadly.

1090
01:07:04,705 --> 01:07:08,125
I see.
How delightfully eccentric,

1091
01:07:08,375 --> 01:07:10,794
while, simultaneously, being a
complete waste of our time.

1092
01:07:10,878 --> 01:07:12,671
No offense. Shall we?
Thank you, Doctor.

1093
01:07:12,755 --> 01:07:13,756
I said good day.

1094
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:14,965
See you, Doc.

1095
01:07:15,049 --> 01:07:18,802
That is why, in general, a mad
scientist is less desirable

1096
01:07:18,886 --> 01:07:21,639
than a garden-variety
scientist.

1097
01:07:24,308 --> 01:07:25,768
Incoming!

1098
01:07:30,564 --> 01:07:32,816
Look out! Out of the way!
Watch out!

1099
01:07:55,589 --> 01:07:57,591
Doc, you're a genius.

1100
01:07:58,092 --> 01:07:59,760
A canned tornado, huh?

1101
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:03,180
Totally nonlethal,
but totally effective.

1102
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:05,182
What is this thing you were
handling before?

1103
01:08:05,265 --> 01:08:06,725
That's a shrinker.

1104
01:08:06,809 --> 01:08:09,770
How do you know?
Oh, a manual. Cool.

1105
01:08:10,187 --> 01:08:13,732
That's a high-temperature fabric
adhesive liquid projector

1106
01:08:13,816 --> 01:08:16,944
based on simple
dry-cleaning technology.

1107
01:08:17,945 --> 01:08:21,365
You aim that at a guy,
and I'll tell you something

1108
01:08:21,448 --> 01:08:24,743
his clothes get so tight
he can't even breathe.

1109
01:08:24,827 --> 01:08:26,286
I can trick that out
with a clam shell holster.

1110
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:28,455
It comes with
a leather carrying case.

1111
01:08:28,539 --> 01:08:30,874
It's got a wad cutter
and a full warranty.

1112
01:08:30,958 --> 01:08:32,000
Nicely done.

1113
01:08:32,084 --> 01:08:33,544
What do you call this?

1114
01:08:33,627 --> 01:08:35,421
Careful, careful.
That's a blame-thrower.

1115
01:08:35,504 --> 01:08:38,382
"A blamethrower"?
I'm sorry.

1116
01:08:38,465 --> 01:08:40,426
Your bad attitude
is hurting this team!

1117
01:08:40,509 --> 01:08:42,344
Stop spitting on me!
I already took a shower!

1118
01:08:42,428 --> 01:08:44,722
You need another shower
'cause you stink!

1119
01:08:44,805 --> 01:08:46,306
Want me to get
that zit for you?

1120
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:47,683
I'm really shaking!

1121
01:08:47,766 --> 01:08:50,644
I'm sorry! I'm sorry if
I spit all the time!

1122
01:08:53,981 --> 01:08:56,150
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1123
01:08:56,233 --> 01:08:58,694
No,no,no.No.

1124
01:09:00,112 --> 01:09:02,948
Doctor, you are a genius.

1125
01:09:03,031 --> 01:09:04,283
That's what the card says.

1126
01:09:05,826 --> 01:09:08,996
I still want to be with them
when they go rescue Amazing.

1127
01:09:09,288 --> 01:09:11,206
So why don't you just go back?

1128
01:09:11,290 --> 01:09:13,500
No, I couldn't go back. I just left
this morning. That would be...

1129
01:09:13,584 --> 01:09:14,710
This is my place.

1130
01:09:14,793 --> 01:09:16,128
That would be ridiculous.

1131
01:09:16,336 --> 01:09:18,088
They're your friends.
They'll understand.

1132
01:09:18,172 --> 01:09:21,216
It's clearly what
you want to do.

1133
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:25,471
That actually could work.
I'm Mr. Furious, right?

1134
01:09:25,554 --> 01:09:27,431
I'm unpredictable.
I'm a loose cannon.

1135
01:09:27,514 --> 01:09:29,641
I go storming off. Why can't
I come storming back?

1136
01:09:29,725 --> 01:09:31,935
I mean, it's all in
how you play it, right?

1137
01:09:32,019 --> 01:09:33,771
Or don't play it.

1138
01:09:33,854 --> 01:09:38,400
Just go back, say you're sorry and
help them save Captain Amazing.

1139
01:09:38,942 --> 01:09:42,154
You think there's a really angry
way I could say I'm sorry?

1140
01:09:42,237 --> 01:09:43,822
Just 'cause
that's kind of my...

1141
01:09:43,906 --> 01:09:47,201
I gotta stick with the anger
thing 'cause people like that.

1142
01:09:51,413 --> 01:09:53,999
Maybe people like you for
who you really are.

1143
01:09:54,833 --> 01:09:56,251
You know?

1144
01:09:58,170 --> 01:10:00,130
Okay, I'm gonna go.

1145
01:10:05,511 --> 01:10:07,679
You should go find
your friends.

1146
01:10:20,567 --> 01:10:21,485
Good.

1147
01:10:21,568 --> 01:10:25,531
Now, the three of you will be
like the eagle's claw.

1148
01:10:25,739 --> 01:10:28,826
You will snatch up the hostage
and carry him to safety.

1149
01:10:28,992 --> 01:10:33,956
We three scouts are like the eagle's
eye: ever watchful for danger.

1150
01:10:35,207 --> 01:10:36,208
Are you ready?

1151
01:10:36,291 --> 01:10:37,417
Yes.
Ready.

1152
01:10:37,501 --> 01:10:41,922
Then let operation Three-Eyed,
Three-Legged Eagle begin.

1153
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:47,886
Shotgun!

1154
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:49,930
I think not, my friend.

1155
01:10:58,438 --> 01:11:00,315
Silly twit.

1156
01:11:01,275 --> 01:11:02,860
Give me a second.

1157
01:11:07,531 --> 01:11:08,532
Hey.

1158
01:11:08,615 --> 01:11:09,658
What's up?

1159
01:11:09,783 --> 01:11:11,827
Not a lot.
What's up with you?

1160
01:11:12,494 --> 01:11:13,996
Nothing much.

1161
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:18,542
Have you seen
my address book?

1162
01:11:18,625 --> 01:11:20,085
No. What did it IO0k like?

1163
01:11:21,295 --> 01:11:25,632
It's denim. It says "Hangloose"onit
with a picture of a kitten.

1164
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,135
No.

1165
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:33,056
You should probably think
about where you saw it last.

1166
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:34,474
Right.

1167
01:11:42,149 --> 01:11:44,234
I should probably...

1168
01:11:46,862 --> 01:11:50,657
Eddie, there's something
I want to say, okay?

1169
01:11:51,158 --> 01:11:54,620
I'm angry about being
left out of this mission,

1170
01:11:54,995 --> 01:11:57,039
and I'm angry about what's
happening with this team,

1171
01:11:57,122 --> 01:11:59,875
but I'm... I'm...

1172
01:12:02,669 --> 01:12:04,588
Oh, boy.

1173
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:08,842
Temperature rising.

1174
01:12:10,218 --> 01:12:11,887
Vision blurring.

1175
01:12:12,804 --> 01:12:15,432
Rage taking over.

1176
01:12:15,515 --> 01:12:16,725
Roy, I got an idea.

1177
01:12:16,808 --> 01:12:17,768
Why don't you come with us?

1178
01:12:17,851 --> 01:12:18,936
Okay.

1179
01:12:19,353 --> 01:12:21,146
Rage subsiding.

1180
01:12:22,648 --> 01:12:24,858
Pulse slowing.

1181
01:12:25,817 --> 01:12:27,361
Anger fading.

1182
01:12:31,156 --> 01:12:33,742
That was
quick thinking, Eddie.

1183
01:12:37,162 --> 01:12:39,706
I wouldn't want anyone
to get hurt.

1184
01:13:08,402 --> 01:13:09,403
Drink, drink!

1185
01:13:09,486 --> 01:13:10,570
Mazel tov!

1186
01:13:16,118 --> 01:13:18,412
Right then. I'll go and
scout out a way in.

1187
01:13:18,495 --> 01:13:19,705
What should the signal be?

1188
01:13:19,788 --> 01:13:21,331
"Karee, karee, karoo."

1189
01:13:21,415 --> 01:13:23,750
No, no, what about,
"Whippoorwill, whippoorwill"?

1190
01:13:23,834 --> 01:13:25,002
No. "Karee karoo."

1191
01:13:25,085 --> 01:13:26,086
Yes, but isn't that better?

1192
01:13:26,253 --> 01:13:27,838
Not interested.

1193
01:13:27,921 --> 01:13:30,007
Enough with the cuckoo!

1194
01:13:30,257 --> 01:13:31,174
We have to find
an open window.

1195
01:13:31,258 --> 01:13:32,384
That's what I just said.

1196
01:13:32,467 --> 01:13:34,344
Go, go!

1197
01:13:40,267 --> 01:13:42,060
Does everyone have a drink?

1198
01:13:42,602 --> 01:13:44,062
Yes, we all do!

1199
01:13:44,146 --> 01:13:45,230
You're all good?

1200
01:13:45,522 --> 01:13:48,692
Good. Well, it is wonderful
in my heart

1201
01:13:49,776 --> 01:13:53,280
to see so many
familiar faces once again.

1202
01:13:53,363 --> 01:13:56,366
The Susies,
assassins from the East.

1203
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:02,914
The Suits, downsizing all
those who dare oppose them.

1204
01:14:02,998 --> 01:14:06,334
And the Furriers,
always dressed to kill.

1205
01:14:11,006 --> 01:14:16,261
And the Frat Boys, still on
probation for lethal hazing.

1206
01:14:16,344 --> 01:14:17,345
Phi Zeta!

1207
01:14:17,429 --> 01:14:20,766
And, of course,
the Not So Goody Mob,

1208
01:14:21,892 --> 01:14:24,227
putting the rhyme into crime!

1209
01:14:24,311 --> 01:14:26,396
The pleasure's all mine,
Frankenstein.

1210
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:29,399
We're about to perpetrate some evil
on these Champion City people.

1211
01:14:29,483 --> 01:14:31,902
Rappin9, snapping, ¢apping.

1212
01:14:31,985 --> 01:14:36,740
Tonight, we are having quite
a party, a surprise party.

1213
01:14:37,824 --> 01:14:40,327
I have a little something
up my sleeve,

1214
01:14:40,577 --> 01:14:44,122
and I'm notjust talking about
the wart on my elbow.

1215
01:14:49,669 --> 01:14:53,298
I have created
a beautiful machine

1216
01:14:53,548 --> 01:14:56,760
that is going to encourage
our fellow citizens,

1217
01:14:57,302 --> 01:14:59,930
to share my vision

1218
01:15:00,013 --> 01:15:01,556
of the world!

1219
01:15:03,266 --> 01:15:04,935
Can you dig it?

1220
01:15:07,187 --> 01:15:09,314
What about Captain Amazing?

1221
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:13,735
That is an excellent
question, Big Tobacco.

1222
01:15:14,361 --> 01:15:18,657
What are we gonna do about the greatest
superhero Champion City has ever known?

1223
01:15:19,241 --> 01:15:23,787
For the answer, I want you
all to walk this way.

1224
01:15:24,204 --> 01:15:26,790
Dude, can we bring
the brewskis?

1225
01:15:27,666 --> 01:15:31,086
Yes, of course. You may
absolutely bring the brewskis.

1226
01:15:39,678 --> 01:15:41,972
Things look
pretty quiet to me.

1227
01:15:46,434 --> 01:15:48,353
Invisible Boy,
did you just let one go?

1228
01:15:48,436 --> 01:15:49,855
No, that wasn't me.

1229
01:15:49,938 --> 01:15:51,106
Well, it wasn't me.

1230
01:15:57,237 --> 01:15:59,406
Don't run! He'll shoot!

1231
01:16:09,166 --> 01:16:11,376
Is he doing what
I think he's doing?

1232
01:16:16,339 --> 01:16:18,216
Just go with it.

1233
01:16:28,852 --> 01:16:30,020
Can anybody see anything?

1234
01:16:30,103 --> 01:16:31,188
Hey!

1235
01:16:31,271 --> 01:16:32,981
Who said, "Hey"?
Not me.

1236
01:16:33,064 --> 01:16:35,942
Eddie, you don't
have to say, "Not me," okay?

1237
01:16:36,276 --> 01:16:37,861
If someone says, "Who?"
and you say...

1238
01:16:37,944 --> 01:16:39,696
Hey, morons,
over here.

1239
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:42,324
It's Captain Amazing!

1240
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,659
We've been looking for you.

1241
01:16:44,743 --> 01:16:47,245
Turn on the light switch
behind you.

1242
01:16:49,331 --> 01:16:54,294
My, my. Well, well.
We meet again, Captain?

1243
01:16:54,628 --> 01:16:55,795
We're here
to rescue you.

1244
01:16:55,879 --> 01:16:57,005
Yeah.

1245
01:16:58,215 --> 01:17:01,301
I'm Blue Raja. Do you recall me?
Master of silverware.

1246
01:17:01,384 --> 01:17:04,137
You told me to keep up the good
work after the Red Eye skirmish.

1247
01:17:04,221 --> 01:17:07,557
I meet so many people in this
business, but I think so.

1248
01:17:07,641 --> 01:17:10,810
Could you two looate the master
ignition switch on the main console?

1249
01:17:10,894 --> 01:17:12,938
Maybe you could open that up?

1250
01:17:13,021 --> 01:17:14,981
Have you out in two shakes
of a lamb's tail.

1251
01:17:15,148 --> 01:17:16,399
Frightfully uncomfortable.
Great.

1252
01:17:16,483 --> 01:17:17,651
How does this work?

1253
01:17:17,734 --> 01:17:19,277
I've seen one of these things.

1254
01:17:19,361 --> 01:17:22,072
You've got to push
this thing in and twist it.

1255
01:17:22,155 --> 01:17:23,365
Don't force it!

1256
01:17:23,448 --> 01:17:24,866
She's right,
my little friend.

1257
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:27,827
This contraption is, in fact,
a weapon of mass destruction.

1258
01:17:27,911 --> 01:17:30,121
Casanova plans to turn it
against the city at midnight.

1259
01:17:30,205 --> 01:17:32,165
Something's happening.

1260
01:17:32,666 --> 01:17:37,337
Okay, very good. On the wall to your left
you should see two toggles side-by-side.

1261
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:40,548
"Toggles"? What do you mean?
You talking about switches?

1262
01:17:41,174 --> 01:17:42,217
I see them, Captain.

1263
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:43,343
Thank you.

1264
01:17:43,426 --> 01:17:44,886
Flip the first toggle.

1265
01:17:44,970 --> 01:17:46,012
Flipping.

1266
01:17:48,348 --> 01:17:49,516
Excellent work.

1267
01:17:49,599 --> 01:17:50,600
Now, flip the...

1268
01:17:50,684 --> 01:17:51,685
Jolly good work, team!

1269
01:17:51,768 --> 01:17:54,854
Could you just
stay over there, please?

1270
01:17:55,105 --> 01:17:56,731
Of course.

1271
01:17:59,526 --> 01:18:00,777
Sorry.

1272
01:18:01,319 --> 01:18:03,321
Now flip the second toggle.

1273
01:18:03,405 --> 01:18:04,739
Do as he says.

1274
01:18:04,823 --> 01:18:06,866
The man knows
what of he speaks.

1275
01:18:07,325 --> 01:18:09,577
I'm just gonna
ask you directly:

1276
01:18:09,661 --> 01:18:11,538
Do you know billionaire
Lance Hunt?

1277
01:18:11,621 --> 01:18:13,164
It's me.

1278
01:18:14,291 --> 01:18:16,626
No, I'm kidding with you.
I've always wanted to do that.

1279
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:17,752
What's next?

1280
01:18:17,836 --> 01:18:19,754
I just told you,
flip the second toggle.

1281
01:18:20,130 --> 01:18:21,381
Again?

1282
01:18:21,464 --> 01:18:22,549
What do you mean?

1283
01:18:23,466 --> 01:18:24,718
Flip the toggle twice?

1284
01:18:24,801 --> 01:18:25,885
No,no,no.

1285
01:18:25,969 --> 01:18:29,222
Don't do that. Just flip it
again now, one time. Flip it.

1286
01:18:29,723 --> 01:18:31,266
Does he understand
what I'm asking?

1287
01:18:31,349 --> 01:18:35,687
Hold on a second. Exactly how
many toggle flips in total,

1288
01:18:35,770 --> 01:18:37,772
are involved
in this procedure?

1289
01:18:37,897 --> 01:18:41,693
L just... It's... Seven!

1290
01:18:42,277 --> 01:18:43,695
Seven?
Flip it!

1291
01:18:43,778 --> 01:18:44,988
Seven?

1292
01:18:45,071 --> 01:18:46,906
Everybody, hold the phone.

1293
01:18:46,990 --> 01:18:50,827
You phrased that incorrectly. We need to
know how many toggle flips are needed,

1294
01:18:50,910 --> 01:18:53,997
notcounfing the gratuitous toggle
flip you may have asked for

1295
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:55,040
in a moment of panic.

1296
01:18:55,123 --> 01:18:56,082
Flip it!

1297
01:18:56,708 --> 01:18:58,251
Could we just start again?

1298
01:18:58,335 --> 01:19:00,295
Is there some sort of
reset button on this thing?

1299
01:19:00,378 --> 01:19:02,839
No, you little freak,
there's no button for resetting.

1300
01:19:02,922 --> 01:19:04,758
Flip the switch, lady.
Don't stare at me.

1301
01:19:04,841 --> 01:19:06,259
Lift your left arm.
Flip it, you moron!

1302
01:19:06,343 --> 01:19:07,594
You're a moron!

1303
01:19:07,677 --> 01:19:08,678
lam not a moron.

1304
01:19:08,762 --> 01:19:10,972
Do not oall her a moron. That's not oool.
Thank you.

1305
01:19:11,056 --> 01:19:12,682
I Will do it!

1306
01:19:12,766 --> 01:19:14,351
Flip the switch, lady!
Don't look at me like that!

1307
01:19:14,434 --> 01:19:16,269
It's this one, yes?

1308
01:19:18,229 --> 01:19:19,731
Wrong switch.

1309
01:19:37,499 --> 01:19:40,168
Everybody heard me say
"reset button," right?

1310
01:19:40,251 --> 01:19:43,129
Oh, my God,
we killed him.

1311
01:19:43,505 --> 01:19:45,924
What do you mean "we"?
I was right here.

1312
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:03,316
I'm gonna check his pulse.

1313
01:20:08,613 --> 01:20:10,573
I don't think
he's gonna pull through.

1314
01:20:10,657 --> 01:20:13,159
Somebody's coming.
We gotta get outta here.

1315
01:20:13,493 --> 01:20:16,204
Everybody should just keep
holding their horses.

1316
01:20:17,497 --> 01:20:19,999
Go, go, go.

1317
01:20:24,546 --> 01:20:26,965
What the hell, man?

1318
01:20:34,514 --> 01:20:35,849
This sucker's dead.

1319
01:20:35,932 --> 01:20:37,725
What happened to him?

1320
01:20:39,018 --> 01:20:43,523
As you can see,
I have taken Captain Amazing

1321
01:20:44,482 --> 01:20:45,942
out of the picture.

1322
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:49,028
It's time for us to rule.

1323
01:20:51,948 --> 01:20:55,577
Tonight at midnight, I'm
going to do to Champion City

1324
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:58,204
what I have done
to its greatest superhero.

1325
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:03,376
And there'll still be time
to go up, get down and boogie.

1326
01:21:04,961 --> 01:21:06,379
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

1327
01:21:06,463 --> 01:21:08,214
Where's
Captain Amazing?

1328
01:21:08,756 --> 01:21:10,216
There's been
a bit of a cock-up.

1329
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:13,761
Guys, I think we got a
little bigger fish to fry right now.

1330
01:21:14,471 --> 01:21:16,473
What the hell was
that machine in there?

1331
01:21:16,556 --> 01:21:19,225
I don't know. But I know
where we can go to find out.

1332
01:21:25,398 --> 01:21:28,067
The vermin are back, Tony.

1333
01:21:29,444 --> 01:21:32,572
Vermin should be
exterminated, Casanova.

1334
01:21:34,032 --> 01:21:38,077
A fish fork is no match
for my machine!

1335
01:21:39,496 --> 01:21:42,332
But I think we should take out
some insurance.

1336
01:21:43,374 --> 01:21:45,043
Don't you think?

1337
01:21:45,126 --> 01:21:46,878
It's
a psychofrakulator.

1338
01:21:46,961 --> 01:21:51,216
It creates a cloud of radically
fluctuating free-deviant chaotrons

1339
01:21:51,299 --> 01:21:53,176
which penetrate
the synaptic relays.

1340
01:21:53,259 --> 01:21:56,554
It's concatenated with a
synchronous transport switoh

1341
01:21:57,096 --> 01:21:59,891
that creates
a virtual tributary.

1342
01:22:00,808 --> 01:22:03,686
It's focused onto
a biobolic reflector.

1343
01:22:03,770 --> 01:22:08,191
And what happens is that
hallucinations become reality

1344
01:22:08,942 --> 01:22:11,027
and the brain is literally
fried from within.

1345
01:22:11,110 --> 01:22:12,070
Where would you get
something like that?

1346
01:22:12,153 --> 01:22:13,154
I don't know.

1347
01:22:13,238 --> 01:22:15,198
They used to say
it couldn't be built.

1348
01:22:15,281 --> 01:22:18,993
The equations were so complex that most
of the scientists who worked on it

1349
01:22:19,077 --> 01:22:20,453
wound up in the insane asylum.

1350
01:22:20,537 --> 01:22:23,957
Which is where Casanova's been
hanging for the last 20 years.

1351
01:22:24,123 --> 01:22:26,709
If he turned that thing on the city,
it'll waste everything in sight.

1352
01:22:26,793 --> 01:22:27,877
BOWLERI Not "if." When.

1353
01:22:27,961 --> 01:22:29,045
We need Captain Amazing.

1354
01:22:29,128 --> 01:22:31,339
Yes, but, unfortunately,
we just killed him.

1355
01:22:31,422 --> 01:22:33,633
Unfortunately,
you killed him.

1356
01:22:33,925 --> 01:22:35,426
Just because you're having
problems at home

1357
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:36,886
don't mean you can go around
killing people.

1358
01:22:36,970 --> 01:22:41,474
"Oh, sorry. Mummy. I'm English.
I didn't mean it."

1359
01:22:41,683 --> 01:22:44,394
K-I-L-L-E-D.
You killed him.

1360
01:22:44,477 --> 01:22:46,896
You killed him. You did. You were
the one who flicked the switch.

1361
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:50,149
It's the same difference.
He's still dead.

1362
01:22:50,858 --> 01:22:51,901
You did kind of...

1363
01:22:51,985 --> 01:22:53,194
Sphinx!

1364
01:22:55,572 --> 01:22:58,199
What in heaven's name
do we do?

1365
01:22:58,283 --> 01:22:59,742
Sometimes,

1366
01:23:00,118 --> 01:23:04,330
the true hero is the one
with the courage to run away.

1367
01:23:04,789 --> 01:23:06,541
I like the way
this man thinks.

1368
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:07,792
Let's run.

1369
01:23:08,710 --> 01:23:09,794
We can't run.

1370
01:23:09,877 --> 01:23:12,672
Oh, yes. It's been
established that we can run.

1371
01:23:14,716 --> 01:23:19,053
This is egg salad loaded with cholesterol.
The wife won't even let me touch it.

1372
01:23:20,179 --> 01:23:24,642
Hardly seems to matter now. 'Cause
chances are, we're already dead.

1373
01:23:25,518 --> 01:23:26,978
Amazing is gone.

1374
01:23:27,061 --> 01:23:30,023
There's no use waiting for the
cavalry, because as of this moment,

1375
01:23:30,106 --> 01:23:31,983
the cavalry is us.

1376
01:23:32,066 --> 01:23:33,943
Yeah, but I don't
wanna get frakulated.

1377
01:23:34,027 --> 01:23:35,445
Psychofrakulated.

1378
01:23:35,528 --> 01:23:36,779
We still get frakulated.

1379
01:23:36,863 --> 01:23:38,489
This is our fight,
whether we like it or not.

1380
01:23:38,573 --> 01:23:40,074
Just we few.

1381
01:23:40,158 --> 01:23:42,368
We're not your
classic superheroes.

1382
01:23:42,827 --> 01:23:45,580
We're not the favorites.
We're the other guys.

1383
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:49,125
We're the guys nobody
ever bets on.

1384
01:23:50,627 --> 01:23:52,295
But I tell you what I think.

1385
01:23:52,378 --> 01:23:56,174
You and that ball of yours have an
appointment that you've gotta keep.

1386
01:23:56,549 --> 01:23:59,344
Invisible Boy, I think
it's time you were seen.

1387
01:23:59,927 --> 01:24:02,055
Sphinx, you have
trained us well.

1388
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:06,809
Dr. Heller, you might just have
given us the edge we need.

1389
01:24:06,893 --> 01:24:09,979
Spleen, I don't wanna
stand behind you.

1390
01:24:10,271 --> 01:24:12,523
But I'll fight beside you
with pride.

1391
01:24:12,982 --> 01:24:15,568
Jeff, you've got
a rare and beautiful gift.

1392
01:24:16,277 --> 01:24:19,072
The city needs you
tonight. And, Roy,

1393
01:24:19,405 --> 01:24:20,948
in all the years
I've known you,

1394
01:24:21,032 --> 01:24:23,534
I've never seen you
walk away from a fight.

1395
01:24:23,785 --> 01:24:25,953
Why, you lifted
a city bus once, man.

1396
01:24:26,037 --> 01:24:29,248
I think you've got what it
takes to handle Casanova.

1397
01:24:30,416 --> 01:24:33,002
We're all in over our
heads, and we know it.

1398
01:24:33,211 --> 01:24:36,297
But if we take on this fight,
those of us who survive it

1399
01:24:36,381 --> 01:24:40,760
will forever after show our scars
with pride and say, "That's right.

1400
01:24:41,135 --> 01:24:44,013
"L was there.
I fought the good fight."

1401
01:24:44,555 --> 01:24:46,015
So, what do you say?

1402
01:24:46,099 --> 01:24:51,104
Do we all gather together and
go kick some Casanova butt,

1403
01:24:51,813 --> 01:24:54,399
or do I eat this sandwich?

1404
01:24:54,482 --> 01:24:58,111
I say, what the fork.
Let's do it.

1405
01:25:00,530 --> 01:25:01,948
If we're gonna bust
into that mansion,

1406
01:25:02,031 --> 01:25:03,574
you're gonna need more than
a station wagon.

1407
01:25:03,658 --> 01:25:05,618
At the auto yard, there's this
old Herkimer battle jitney.

1408
01:25:05,702 --> 01:25:06,953
Sally's always telling me
to junk it.

1409
01:25:07,036 --> 01:25:09,455
Wait. You have
a Herkimer battle jitney?

1410
01:25:09,539 --> 01:25:12,625
That's the finest non-lethal
military vehicle ever made.

1411
01:25:12,709 --> 01:25:15,461
All right, we'll meet at the junkyard.
VVe'll go from there.

1412
01:25:15,545 --> 01:25:17,922
I shall need more forks,
I'm afraid.

1413
01:25:18,423 --> 01:25:20,883
Those of you with loved ones,
say good-bye before we go.

1414
01:25:20,967 --> 01:25:22,927
You may not get
another chance.

1415
01:25:29,142 --> 01:25:31,102
<i>Seigesund.</i>

1416
01:25:40,653 --> 01:25:41,988
Hey, Mom.

1417
01:25:43,030 --> 01:25:44,949
Jeffrey, what are you doing?

1418
01:25:45,283 --> 01:25:47,410
I was just...

1419
01:25:55,209 --> 01:25:56,919
I'm a superhero, Mother.

1420
01:25:57,503 --> 01:25:59,088
A superhero?

1421
01:25:59,172 --> 01:26:01,299
An effete British superhero,
to be precise.

1422
01:26:01,382 --> 01:26:04,510
I am pilfering your tableware
because I hurl it.

1423
01:26:04,927 --> 01:26:08,973
I hurl it with a deadly accuracy.
The Blue Raja is my name.

1424
01:26:09,056 --> 01:26:11,976
Yes, I know. I don't wear much blue,
and I speak in a British accent.

1425
01:26:12,059 --> 01:26:13,936
But if you know your history, it
really does make perfect sense.

1426
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:17,607
The point is, your boy's a
limey fork-flinger, Mother.

1427
01:26:17,690 --> 01:26:20,443
Hard cheese to swallow,
but there it is.

1428
01:26:20,526 --> 01:26:22,695
What will the bridge
club think?

1429
01:26:26,949 --> 01:26:29,035
You need more forks?

1430
01:26:32,789 --> 01:26:35,875
These belonged to your
great-great grandmother.

1431
01:26:36,167 --> 01:26:38,461
I was saving these
for your wedding day.

1432
01:26:38,544 --> 01:26:43,549
But from the looks of it, that
day, it's probably a long way off.

1433
01:26:44,133 --> 01:26:47,804
Mom, you're taking this
incredibly well.

1434
01:26:48,387 --> 01:26:50,556
I've always known
you were special,

1435
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:54,560
but I just never realized
how special.

1436
01:27:00,149 --> 01:27:01,692
I'd better get going.

1437
01:27:02,485 --> 01:27:03,694
I've got a city to save.

1438
01:27:03,778 --> 01:27:05,530
Jeffrey?
Yeah?

1439
01:27:05,696 --> 01:27:07,240
Do the accent.

1440
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:13,204
I'd love to stay and chitchat,
but I fear I must away with me.

1441
01:27:13,287 --> 01:27:16,415
Our metropolis is in
the clutches of madmen.

1442
01:27:16,499 --> 01:27:18,751
Jeffrey? Cheerio.

1443
01:27:18,835 --> 01:27:19,919
I really should get going.

1444
01:27:20,002 --> 01:27:21,379
Okay.

1445
01:27:24,632 --> 01:27:26,592
Thanks, Ma.

1446
01:27:35,601 --> 01:27:38,646
I said I was gonna leave
you, and I meant it.

1447
01:27:40,147 --> 01:27:44,110
The city's in peril, Lucille.
We're the best hope they've got.

1448
01:27:44,861 --> 01:27:47,446
Eddie, please don't start.

1449
01:27:47,905 --> 01:27:49,866
I don't expect you
to believe me.

1450
01:27:49,949 --> 01:27:53,619
L just came by
to tell you that I love you.

1451
01:27:54,370 --> 01:27:56,122
Tell the kids I love them.

1452
01:27:56,622 --> 01:27:59,792
And now, good-bye.

1453
01:28:00,459 --> 01:28:01,961
Good-bye, Eddie.

1454
01:28:03,421 --> 01:28:05,590
I won't be here
when you come home.

1455
01:28:06,048 --> 01:28:08,134
Well, that's a chance
I'm gonna have to take.

1456
01:28:08,217 --> 01:28:12,013
Otherwise, there may not be
a home to come back to.

1457
01:28:21,981 --> 01:28:23,691
Wish me luck.

1458
01:28:32,033 --> 01:28:34,201
Hi.

1459
01:28:34,285 --> 01:28:35,244
You Okay?

1460
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:37,455
I wanted to say
I had a great time tonight.

1461
01:28:37,538 --> 01:28:39,624
And you were
really nice to me.

1462
01:28:39,707 --> 01:28:43,169
And I would love to,
to ask you out sometime.

1463
01:28:43,252 --> 01:28:46,631
But if I don't call you, I want you
to know it's because I'm dead.

1464
01:28:46,714 --> 01:28:49,884
Me and my team, we're gonna
take on Casanova Frankenstein.

1465
01:28:49,967 --> 01:28:52,553
And it's pretty much
a suicide mission.

1466
01:28:52,637 --> 01:28:56,849
So, if there is anything that
you wanna say to me,

1467
01:28:57,141 --> 01:29:00,811
now would probably be a good
time to say it, just 'cause...

1468
01:29:00,895 --> 01:29:02,897
Yeah, I got
a question for you.

1469
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:04,148
Cool. Kick it.

1470
01:29:04,231 --> 01:29:05,942
What's your name?

1471
01:29:06,067 --> 01:29:08,903
Do you mean my secret identity?
'Cause I couldn't.

1472
01:29:09,028 --> 01:29:11,739
No, I just,
you know, mean your name.

1473
01:29:13,074 --> 01:29:14,575
My name.

1474
01:29:16,494 --> 01:29:17,703
Okay.

1475
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:22,875
It's Phoenix.

1476
01:29:24,085 --> 01:29:26,379
Phoenix Dark.

1477
01:29:27,380 --> 01:29:29,715
Dirk. Phoenix...

1478
01:29:30,925 --> 01:29:31,968
Dark-Dirk.

1479
01:29:32,051 --> 01:29:35,346
It was...
I was christened Dirk Steele,

1480
01:29:35,429 --> 01:29:36,639
and I changed it to Phoenix.

1481
01:29:36,722 --> 01:29:38,849
Forget about it.
It's okay.

1482
01:29:45,731 --> 01:29:47,191
It's Roy.

1483
01:29:48,859 --> 01:29:50,987
That's my name.
My name is...

1484
01:29:52,405 --> 01:29:54,824
My real name is Roy.

1485
01:30:14,385 --> 01:30:16,971
Just be Roy.

1486
01:30:26,939 --> 01:30:30,776
Roy, the Roy. Yes, I'm Roy.

1487
01:30:30,860 --> 01:30:32,445
Who is Roy? Roy is who?

1488
01:30:32,528 --> 01:30:34,321
He's freaking out, man.

1489
01:30:34,405 --> 01:30:37,033
Where's the guy who pretends
not to be Roy?

1490
01:30:37,116 --> 01:30:39,201
We've had quite enough
of that. Just stop it.

1491
01:30:39,285 --> 01:30:42,204
Just snap out of it.
We're tired of it.

1492
01:30:42,288 --> 01:30:46,792
I'm a wannabe. A true wannabe,
in the worst sense of the...

1493
01:30:46,959 --> 01:30:48,919
You guys are gonna have to go
fight this battle without me.

1494
01:30:49,003 --> 01:30:51,422
You start doubting your super
powers, you are shafted.

1495
01:30:51,505 --> 01:30:54,925
If I had any super powers, I guess I
would be in trouble, but I don't.

1496
01:30:55,009 --> 01:30:56,635
What do I do?
I go...

1497
01:30:58,012 --> 01:31:00,389
What are you talking about?
You lifted a bus once.

1498
01:31:00,473 --> 01:31:03,225
Precisely.
That story's legendary.

1499
01:31:03,309 --> 01:31:06,437
It was really more of a push,
really, than a lift.

1500
01:31:06,645 --> 01:31:09,356
That still takes incredible
superhuman strength.

1501
01:31:09,732 --> 01:31:12,068
It does, to push
an entire bus out the way.

1502
01:31:12,151 --> 01:31:15,154
Actually, the driver kind of had
his foot on the accelerator,

1503
01:31:15,237 --> 01:31:17,364
just in the beginning, just to get
it going, then it actually was me.

1504
01:31:17,448 --> 01:31:19,575
But he kind of...

1505
01:31:22,161 --> 01:31:23,746
Oh, shit.

1506
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,127
Excuse me.

1507
01:31:32,588 --> 01:31:36,133
It's a process which results in
an accelerated flow of electrons

1508
01:31:36,217 --> 01:31:38,302
that creates such
a powerful magnetic force.

1509
01:31:38,385 --> 01:31:40,971
This is basically
like a huge electromagnet.

1510
01:31:41,138 --> 01:31:44,266
Actually, it's
an electro-nuclear-magnet.

1511
01:31:44,517 --> 01:31:45,935
It's the next
inevitable phase.

1512
01:31:46,018 --> 01:31:48,437
Vis, can you
close up those jockey boxes?

1513
01:31:48,521 --> 01:31:49,522
Right On it.

1514
01:31:49,647 --> 01:31:53,150
Let's get suited up.
We're out of here in five.

1515
01:31:57,613 --> 01:31:59,031
It's time.

1516
01:32:01,117 --> 01:32:02,535
Let's go.

1517
01:32:54,378 --> 01:32:55,504
Shotgun!

1518
01:32:55,588 --> 01:32:57,131
I've already called it,
didn't I?

1519
01:32:57,214 --> 01:32:58,257
Have a seat, my friend.

1520
01:32:58,340 --> 01:32:59,675
Everybody ready?

1521
01:33:00,176 --> 01:33:02,011
And we have lift-off.

1522
01:33:02,094 --> 01:33:04,013
May the forks
be with us.

1523
01:33:09,018 --> 01:33:10,853
I'm sorry.
Too much throttle.

1524
01:33:10,936 --> 01:33:12,521
That's cool.
I'm just gonna go.

1525
01:33:12,605 --> 01:33:13,981
Yo, sit down!

1526
01:33:14,064 --> 01:33:15,357
All right,
here we go.

1527
01:33:29,663 --> 01:33:31,457
<i>Va ya con Dios.</i>

1528
01:33:35,836 --> 01:33:37,796
Somebody do something.
We need him.

1529
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:40,382
Let's do this.
You're a very furious man.

1530
01:33:40,466 --> 01:33:42,343
Do you understand that?
No.

1531
01:33:42,426 --> 01:33:45,554
You got a lot to be furious
about, and I'll tell you why.

1532
01:33:45,638 --> 01:33:49,725
You're not well-liked. You're
abrasive and off-putting.

1533
01:33:49,808 --> 01:33:52,102
You try and say pithy things,
but your wit is a hindrance,

1534
01:33:52,186 --> 01:33:54,104
and so therefore,
nothing is provocative.

1535
01:33:54,188 --> 01:33:57,233
It's just mixed metaphors. Now,
doesn't that make you angry?

1536
01:33:57,316 --> 01:33:59,193
Does it infuriate you?
No.

1537
01:33:59,276 --> 01:34:02,321
It should. Are you angry?
Come on, man!

1538
01:34:02,488 --> 01:34:04,490
Your penmanship is atrocious.

1539
01:34:04,573 --> 01:34:06,492
You dress
like a male prostitute.

1540
01:34:11,664 --> 01:34:14,875
Get real! I have
no powers whatsoever.

1541
01:34:15,251 --> 01:34:17,753
If he has no powers,
maybe I've got no powers.

1542
01:34:17,836 --> 01:34:19,546
Maybe I can't turn
invisible at all.

1543
01:34:19,630 --> 01:34:21,340
Do not go there,
my son.

1544
01:34:21,423 --> 01:34:24,301
When you doubt your powers,
you give power to your doubts.

1545
01:34:24,385 --> 01:34:28,430
I don't mean to be alarmist,
but it's half 11:00 already.

1546
01:34:28,514 --> 01:34:31,016
Thirty minutes till Casanova
blows up the city.

1547
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:35,229
Listen. We've got
a blind date with destiny.

1548
01:34:36,772 --> 01:34:39,692
And it looks like
she's ordered the lobster.

1549
01:34:43,112 --> 01:34:45,114
We're gonna ram the gate!

1550
01:35:03,048 --> 01:35:06,719
What do you think? Should we
knock or just let ourselves in?

1551
01:35:22,985 --> 01:35:24,570
Hit the ground!

1552
01:35:41,295 --> 01:35:43,088
They're shooting!

1553
01:35:59,855 --> 01:36:02,941
I hope this magnet
thing works.

1554
01:36:16,747 --> 01:36:19,208
It's working.

1555
01:36:29,802 --> 01:36:31,303
GO! GQ!

1556
01:36:33,764 --> 01:36:36,475
Everybody, into
the disco room.

1557
01:36:40,187 --> 01:36:43,399
Everyone, through here.
Keep moving.

1558
01:36:44,024 --> 01:36:46,235
Focus, people. Focus.
Let's go.

1559
01:36:52,825 --> 01:36:54,159
Hello?

1560
01:37:02,584 --> 01:37:03,836
Wait!

1561
01:37:12,428 --> 01:37:14,221
Laser eye.

1562
01:37:25,858 --> 01:37:27,943
I knew I should have brought
my large pie server.

1563
01:37:28,026 --> 01:37:31,113
If we can't get through that
door, this battle is over.

1564
01:37:35,242 --> 01:37:38,412
This is it? My time has come.

1565
01:37:39,830 --> 01:37:42,583
What are you
talking about?

1566
01:37:42,958 --> 01:37:44,668
Wait. Invisible Boy.

1567
01:37:44,751 --> 01:37:45,836
I wouldn't do that, if...

1568
01:37:45,919 --> 01:37:47,588
Come back here.
You'll be cremated.

1569
01:37:47,671 --> 01:37:49,131
It's all about me now.

1570
01:37:49,214 --> 01:37:50,966
I'm the only one
that can save us.

1571
01:37:51,049 --> 01:37:52,134
He's right.

1572
01:37:52,217 --> 01:37:53,594
Good luck, son.

1573
01:37:53,677 --> 01:37:54,803
Nobody look at me.

1574
01:37:54,887 --> 01:37:57,473
Don't look at him,
or it won't work.

1575
01:37:57,556 --> 01:37:59,141
I am transparent.

1576
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:02,853
lam like the window.
I am see-through.

1577
01:38:03,103 --> 01:38:04,897
I'm like Saran Wrap.

1578
01:38:14,907 --> 01:38:18,243
I did it! I'm invisible!
I really do have super powers.

1579
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:20,412
Can you see me?

1580
01:38:20,662 --> 01:38:22,331
Yes.

1581
01:38:23,499 --> 01:38:25,250
Two hands there, son.

1582
01:38:25,334 --> 01:38:29,588
Maybe you should put some shorts on
if you wanna keep fighting evil.

1583
01:38:30,589 --> 01:38:33,425
Furriers, you will stay here
and delay the attackers.

1584
01:38:33,509 --> 01:38:38,514
Not So Goody Mob, fight from behind.
The rest of you, into the atrium.

1585
01:38:38,597 --> 01:38:41,517
And spread yourself out
for a second wave of attack.

1586
01:38:52,778 --> 01:38:55,113
The door. Door.

1587
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:59,451
On three. One, two, three.

1588
01:39:13,507 --> 01:39:14,967
Shrink them.

1589
01:39:28,063 --> 01:39:32,234
I say, they've gone from
junior to missy petite.

1590
01:39:33,527 --> 01:39:36,071
Now that's a wedgie
she won't soon forget.

1591
01:39:36,780 --> 01:39:39,825
My pants feel like
they're shrinking too.

1592
01:39:45,497 --> 01:39:47,207
This way!

1593
01:39:47,291 --> 01:39:48,500
Look out!

1594
01:39:53,922 --> 01:39:55,299
I got a bone to pick with you.

1595
01:39:55,382 --> 01:39:58,010
Hold it, Little Daddy.

1596
01:39:58,093 --> 01:40:00,679
You know what?
Y'all make me sick.

1597
01:40:10,022 --> 01:40:12,733
Give me that gun.

1598
01:40:16,069 --> 01:40:17,279
I got them.

1599
01:40:17,362 --> 01:40:18,363
Disco forever!

1600
01:40:18,739 --> 01:40:21,199
Invisible Boy, Spleen.
Susies.

1601
01:41:12,125 --> 01:41:14,211
Dig this, Shovel Man.

1602
01:41:22,177 --> 01:41:23,720
Duck! It's the Susies!

1603
01:41:23,804 --> 01:41:25,055
Grab the gun.

1604
01:41:25,138 --> 01:41:26,139
It's stuck.

1605
01:41:26,932 --> 01:41:28,308
Coast clear?

1606
01:41:28,392 --> 01:41:30,102
Shoot anyway.

1607
01:41:32,938 --> 01:41:34,106
I'm scared.

1608
01:41:34,189 --> 01:41:35,565
No, you're not scared.
Be strong.

1609
01:41:35,649 --> 01:41:38,318
Say it with me
"I ain't scared of no Susies."

1610
01:41:38,402 --> 01:41:39,403
I am scared of the Susies.

1611
01:41:39,486 --> 01:41:40,654
Say "I'm not scared
of no Susies."

1612
01:41:40,737 --> 01:41:42,698
Come on. You ready?

1613
01:41:43,198 --> 01:41:44,741
Let's go!

1614
01:41:52,874 --> 01:41:55,127
Dive! Dive!

1615
01:42:06,012 --> 01:42:07,639
I'm hit!

1616
01:42:07,764 --> 01:42:08,724
Where?

1617
01:42:08,807 --> 01:42:10,934
I'm hit! Medic!
Medic! Man down!

1618
01:42:11,017 --> 01:42:13,228
Man down! I can't feel my ass.
What?

1619
01:42:13,311 --> 01:42:15,230
I can't feel my ass.
What?

1620
01:42:15,313 --> 01:42:16,606
Your powers still work?

1621
01:42:16,690 --> 01:42:17,899
My powers?
Yeah.

1622
01:42:17,983 --> 01:42:19,609
Weapons check.

1623
01:42:21,361 --> 01:42:23,572
Fire in the hole! Pull!

1624
01:42:28,243 --> 01:42:29,578
It'll do.

1625
01:42:30,162 --> 01:42:33,832
Go check on Spleen, okay?
Okay. All right.

1626
01:42:37,169 --> 01:42:38,670
You ought to run, Tony P.

1627
01:42:38,754 --> 01:42:41,173
You can't hurt me,
Baby Bowler.

1628
01:42:42,466 --> 01:42:44,217
'Cause I'm protected

1629
01:42:46,011 --> 01:42:49,848
by the god of hair care.

1630
01:42:50,599 --> 01:42:52,934
And it's time to send you
back to your daddy.

1631
01:42:53,018 --> 01:42:54,102
You killed my father.

1632
01:42:54,186 --> 01:42:56,688
That's right.
'Cause I'm a killer.

1633
01:42:56,855 --> 01:43:00,233
And you're not.
Let's face it, kid.

1634
01:43:00,317 --> 01:43:02,486
You don't have
the guts to kill me.

1635
01:43:02,778 --> 01:43:05,947
You're right. I don't have
the guts to kill you.

1636
01:43:06,031 --> 01:43:09,034
Because I'm better than you.
Yeah, that's right.

1637
01:43:09,326 --> 01:43:10,702
A lot better.

1638
01:43:11,703 --> 01:43:15,540
You know, I may even find the
courage to forgive you someday.

1639
01:43:24,549 --> 01:43:28,637
Carmine, on the other hand, feels
differently than I do about forgiveness.

1640
01:43:30,764 --> 01:43:33,892
Now I'm going back to graduate school.
That was the agreement.

1641
01:43:33,975 --> 01:43:36,853
We're doing it. We're winning.
We're gonna pull this off.

1642
01:43:36,937 --> 01:43:39,189
I wouldn't be so sure
about that.

1643
01:43:39,898 --> 01:43:43,735
Tell your funny-looking friends to
put down their weapons, Mr. Furious.

1644
01:43:43,819 --> 01:43:46,279
Just get out of here. He's crazy.
Save yourselves.

1645
01:43:46,363 --> 01:43:50,659
Put them down or I will slash your
girlfriend's pretty little throat.

1646
01:43:51,034 --> 01:43:53,578
Eddie, Jeff, do what he says.

1647
01:43:58,208 --> 01:43:59,918
Thank you.

1648
01:44:00,252 --> 01:44:04,130
It's so easy to get the best of people
when they care about each other.

1649
01:44:05,173 --> 01:44:07,759
Which is why evil
will always have the edge.

1650
01:44:08,218 --> 01:44:11,847
You good guys are always
so bound by the rules.

1651
01:44:18,770 --> 01:44:21,398
You see, I kill my own men.

1652
01:44:27,821 --> 01:44:29,781
And lucky me.

1653
01:44:30,282 --> 01:44:32,242
I get the girl.

1654
01:44:33,201 --> 01:44:35,412
No!

1655
01:45:02,022 --> 01:45:06,902
Don't worry. It will all
be over so very quickly.

1656
01:45:11,323 --> 01:45:12,574
What are you doing?

1657
01:45:12,657 --> 01:45:15,243
They must have ripped the "Q"
section out of my dictionary,

1658
01:45:15,327 --> 01:45:18,622
'cause I don't know the
meaning of the word "quit."

1659
01:45:32,510 --> 01:45:35,597
You want
a little fisticuffs? Okay.

1660
01:45:39,309 --> 01:45:40,977
Get him, Roy.

1661
01:45:46,191 --> 01:45:47,859
Come on, Roy!

1662
01:46:01,831 --> 01:46:03,541
It's the funkyskunkulator!

1663
01:46:03,667 --> 01:46:04,709
We've got to stop it.

1664
01:46:04,793 --> 01:46:06,378
Don't touch any toggles.

1665
01:46:08,046 --> 01:46:10,715
Rage taking over.

1666
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:13,259
Ja. We've heard
all that before.

1667
01:46:14,886 --> 01:46:16,304
No, no.

1668
01:46:16,554 --> 01:46:19,057
Rage really taking over.

1669
01:47:09,691 --> 01:47:12,485
Frak-you later, Frankenpuss.

1670
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:21,327
Yeah!

1671
01:47:39,888 --> 01:47:41,473
Get out of here.

1672
01:47:46,770 --> 01:47:48,438
Hit the deck.

1673
01:47:52,275 --> 01:47:54,319
How do we shut
this thing down?

1674
01:47:55,320 --> 01:47:57,447
Group hug!

1675
01:47:57,530 --> 01:47:59,324
Yeah! Okay!
Yeah!

1676
01:48:05,205 --> 01:48:06,247
Hurry UP!

1677
01:48:06,331 --> 01:48:08,166
Get her closer to the hole!

1678
01:48:11,586 --> 01:48:14,255
Dad, this is the way
it has to be.

1679
01:48:14,547 --> 01:48:17,967
The upshot is you won't be killed
because you're already dead.

1680
01:48:18,176 --> 01:48:19,928
No, I'm not going with you.

1681
01:48:20,011 --> 01:48:23,807
If there's a time for separation, let
me tell you something, this is it.

1682
01:48:23,890 --> 01:48:24,933
Lift me up.

1683
01:48:25,016 --> 01:48:26,017
Push her up.

1684
01:48:26,101 --> 01:48:28,978
Help me lift her up.
Help her.

1685
01:48:29,062 --> 01:48:32,816
You can do it. Hold on.

1686
01:48:35,610 --> 01:48:37,445
Do it!

1687
01:48:37,529 --> 01:48:38,696
I love you, Dad!

1688
01:48:49,457 --> 01:48:51,459
Run! Run!

1689
01:48:51,543 --> 01:48:52,794
Let's get out of here!

1690
01:48:52,919 --> 01:48:55,046
Run for your lives!

1691
01:48:59,217 --> 01:49:00,593
Run!

1692
01:49:08,810 --> 01:49:10,311
Go!

1693
01:49:19,112 --> 01:49:20,780
GO! GQ!

1694
01:49:33,126 --> 01:49:35,837
<i>No one could survive
the chaos we've just witnessed here.</i>

1695
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:39,924
<i>But as the dust begins to settle over
the ruins of the Casanova's mansion,</i>

1696
01:49:40,258 --> 01:49:42,218
<i>the question remains.</i>

1697
01:49:42,302 --> 01:49:46,389
<i>Who were these brave heroes that gave
their lives to save our city tonight?</i>

1698
01:49:46,556 --> 01:49:49,517
Did that frakulator work, or what?
What's the deal there?

1699
01:49:49,601 --> 01:49:51,853
Look. Something's moving.
People are coming out.

1700
01:49:51,936 --> 01:49:53,730
Could you tell us
what's going on?

1701
01:49:53,813 --> 01:49:55,273
NEWSCASTERI Hi. Excuse me.

1702
01:49:55,356 --> 01:49:58,318
Can you tell us
what happened here tonight?

1703
01:49:58,943 --> 01:50:00,069
We <i>did</i> it.
We <i>won.</i>

1704
01:50:00,153 --> 01:50:01,362
Hey, that's my team.

1705
01:50:01,905 --> 01:50:05,116
<i>We struck down evil with
the mighty sword of teamwork</i>

1706
01:50:05,325 --> 01:50:06,868
<i>and the hammer
of not-bickering.</i>

1707
01:50:06,951 --> 01:50:10,205
<i>We are number one. All others
are number two or lower.</i>

1708
01:50:10,288 --> 01:50:11,664
<i>Who</i> are you <i>guys?</i>

1709
01:50:12,457 --> 01:50:13,625
<i>They call me the Shoveler.</i>

1710
01:50:13,708 --> 01:50:16,127
That's my dad.

1711
01:50:17,295 --> 01:50:18,796
My hero.
<i>I'm the Bowler.</i>

1712
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,006
<i>Hello.</i>

1713
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:25,803
<i>Blue Raja,
master of silverware. Hi, Mom.</i>

1714
01:50:25,887 --> 01:50:28,765
<i>I mean, cheerio, Mummy.</i>

1715
01:50:29,015 --> 01:50:30,558
Jeffrey.

1716
01:50:30,642 --> 01:50:31,726
REPORTER; And you, sir.

1717
01:50:31,809 --> 01:50:33,978
<i>What's your name
and your superpower?</i>

1718
01:50:34,062 --> 01:50:35,063
My name's Roy.

1719
01:50:36,105 --> 01:50:38,816
I'm in a super amount of pain right now.
Could you please leave me alone?

1720
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:43,321
His name's Mr. Furious, and his power
comes from his boundless rage.

1721
01:50:43,404 --> 01:50:47,283
Excuse me. Could I say something? I
think we would all like this victory

1722
01:50:47,367 --> 01:50:49,410
to go out to
all the other guys.

1723
01:50:49,494 --> 01:50:52,121
I'm talking about the people in this
city who are super good at their jobs

1724
01:50:52,205 --> 01:50:55,416
but never get any credit,
like the lady in the D.M.V.

1725
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:56,709
That's a rough job.

1726
01:50:56,793 --> 01:50:57,919
To the people
that rememberjingles

1727
01:50:58,002 --> 01:50:59,921
from tons of old commercials.

1728
01:51:00,004 --> 01:51:02,590
And people that support local music
and seek out independent film.

1729
01:51:02,674 --> 01:51:05,927
And the guy that drives the snow plow.
And the school nurse...

1730
01:51:06,010 --> 01:51:07,804
Eddie, Eddie,
I think they got the point.

1731
01:51:07,887 --> 01:51:09,681
What's the name of this group?

1732
01:51:09,764 --> 01:51:10,932
The Super Dudes.

1733
01:51:11,015 --> 01:51:12,642
No, not the Super Dudes.

1734
01:51:12,725 --> 01:51:15,979
We don't have a name yet, but
definitely not the Super Dudes.

1735
01:51:16,062 --> 01:51:17,772
I gotta get home.
It's late.

1736
01:51:17,855 --> 01:51:20,108
<i>Picture, picture time.</i>

1737
01:51:22,986 --> 01:51:26,656
<i>Whatever you call them, Champion City
will forever owe a debt of gratitude</i>

1738
01:51:26,739 --> 01:51:28,741
to these mystery men.

1739
01:51:28,950 --> 01:51:33,913
Wait. That's it.
We are the Super Squad.

1740
01:51:34,372 --> 01:51:39,294
No! Alliteration in
these situations is corny.

1741
01:51:39,919 --> 01:51:43,798
What? Yes, we're all very
aware that you saved the day,

1742
01:51:43,881 --> 01:51:47,927
and I'm sure we'll be hearing about
it for the rest of our lives.
