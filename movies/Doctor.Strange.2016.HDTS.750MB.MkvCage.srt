1
00:02:23,988 --> 00:02:25,688
Master Kaecilius.

2
00:02:27,294 --> 00:02:30,421
That ritual will bring you only sorrow.

3
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:07,908
Hypocrite!

4
00:05:03,275 --> 00:05:04,974
Challenge round, Billy.

5
00:05:08,204 --> 00:05:11,783
Oh, come on, Billy.
You've got to be messing with me.

6
00:05:11,784 --> 00:05:12,784
No, doctor.

7
00:05:13,378 --> 00:05:16,092
Feels So Good, Chuck Mangione, 1977.

8
00:05:16,489 --> 00:05:20,108
Seriously, Billy, you said this one
would be hard. - Hah! It's 1978.

9
00:05:20,109 --> 00:05:22,992
No, Billy, while Feels So Good
may have charted in 1978,

10
00:05:22,993 --> 00:05:26,481
the album was released in December, 1977.

11
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:29,210
No, no. Wikipedia says the...
- Check again.

12
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:31,860
When did you...? - Where do you
store all this useless information?

13
00:05:32,335 --> 00:05:35,527
Useless? The man charted a
top ten hit with a Flugelhorn.

14
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:39,156
- Status, Billy? - 1977.
- Oh! Please.

15
00:05:39,157 --> 00:05:39,979
I hate you.

16
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,879
Woah! "Feels so good", doesn't it?

17
00:05:46,358 --> 00:05:49,567
Oh, I... I've got this, Stephen. You've
done your bit. Go ahead, we'll close up.

18
00:05:50,882 --> 00:05:52,583
- What is that?
- GSW.

19
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:56,808
It's amazing you kept him alive.

20
00:05:56,809 --> 00:05:58,809
Apneic, further brain stem
testing after reflex test...

21
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,894
I think I found the problem, Dr. Palmer.

22
00:06:01,264 --> 00:06:04,363
You left a bullet in his head.
- Thanks. It's impinging on the medulla.

23
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,958
I needed a specialist to
diagnose brain death.

24
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,576
Something about that
doesn't feel right to me.

25
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:10,577
We have to run.

26
00:06:11,968 --> 00:06:15,985
Dr. West! What are you doing? Hey!
- Organ harvesting. He's a donor.

27
00:06:16,048 --> 00:06:17,978
Slow down. I did not agree to that.
- I don't

28
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,973
need you to. We've already
called brain death.

29
00:06:19,974 --> 00:06:22,429
Too premature. We need to get him
prepped for a suboccipital craniotomy.

30
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,074
I'm not going to let you operate
on a dead man. - What do you see?

31
00:06:25,121 --> 00:06:28,050
A bullet?
- A perfect bullet. It's been hardened.

32
00:06:28,062 --> 00:06:31,122
You harden a bullet by
alloying lead with antimony.

33
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:33,871
A toxic metal. And as it leaks directly
into the cerebral spinal fluid...

34
00:06:33,877 --> 00:06:37,472
Rapid-onset central nervous
system shutdown. - We need to go.

35
00:06:37,473 --> 00:06:40,633
The patient's not dead, but he's dying.
Do you still want to harvest his organs?

36
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:44,471
I'll assist you.
- No! Dr. Palmer will assist me.

37
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,559
Thank you.

38
00:07:08,812 --> 00:07:11,930
Image status, STAT.
- We do not have time for that.

39
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,566
You can't do it by hand.
- I can and I will.

40
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,879
This isn't the time
for showing off, Strange.

41
00:07:17,914 --> 00:07:20,779
How about ten minutes ago, when
you called the wrong time of death?

42
00:07:29,595 --> 00:07:31,294
Cranial nerves intact.

43
00:07:56,432 --> 00:07:58,566
Dr. West, cover your watch.

44
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,653
You know, you didn't have to
humiliate him in front of everyone.

45
00:08:44,654 --> 00:08:47,068
I didn't have to save his
patient either. But,

46
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,454
you know, sometimes I
just can't help myself.

47
00:08:49,455 --> 00:08:51,953
Nick is a great doctor.
- You came to me.

48
00:08:51,954 --> 00:08:54,753
Yeah, well, I needed a second opinion.
- You had a second opinion.

49
00:08:54,754 --> 00:08:56,803
What you needed was a competent one.
- Well, all the

50
00:08:56,815 --> 00:08:58,953
more reason why you should
be my neurosurgeon on call.

51
00:08:58,954 --> 00:09:00,352
You could make such a difference.

52
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:02,277
I can't work in your butcher shop.
- Hey! Look, he...

53
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:04,069
Look, I'm using trans-sectioned
spinal cords to

54
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:06,152
stimulate neurogenesis in
the central nervous system.

55
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:08,361
My work is at least going to
save thousands for years to come.

56
00:09:08,362 --> 00:09:11,351
In the ER, I get to save one
drunk idiot with a gun.

57
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:13,629
Yeah, you're right. In the ER,
you're only saving lives.

58
00:09:13,664 --> 00:09:16,410
There's no fame,
there's no CNN interviews...

59
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:18,936
Well, I guess I'll have to stick with Nick.

60
00:09:18,971 --> 00:09:21,779
Oh, wait a minute. You're not...
you guys aren't...

61
00:09:21,784 --> 00:09:26,349
What? - Sleeping together. Sorry, I
thought that was implicit in my disgust.

62
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,198
Explicit, actually.

63
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:30,148
And no, I have a very strict rule
against dating colleagues.

64
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:32,048
Oh really?
- I call it the Strange policy.

65
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:34,948
Oh, good! I'm glad something
is named after me.

66
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,947
You know, I invented a
laminectomy procedure,

67
00:09:36,948 --> 00:09:40,246
and yet, somehow, no one seems to want
to call it the Strange technique.

68
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,621
We invented that technique.
- You know, I

69
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:45,246
gotta say, I'm very
flattered by your policy.

70
00:09:45,247 --> 00:09:50,321
Look, I'm talking tonight at a
Neurological Society dinner. Come with me.

71
00:09:50,814 --> 00:09:54,345
Another speaking engagement? So romantic.

72
00:09:54,346 --> 00:09:55,845
You used to love going
to those things with me.

73
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:57,944
We had fun together.
- No. You've had fun.

74
00:09:57,945 --> 00:10:01,432
They weren't about us, they were about you.

75
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:05,643
- Not only about me.
- Stephen. Everything is about you.

76
00:10:06,354 --> 00:10:10,742
Maybe we can hyphenate.
Strange-Palmer technique.

77
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,542
Palmer-Strange.

78
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:03,435
Billy! What have you got for me?

79
00:11:03,436 --> 00:11:06,385
I've got a 35-year-old Air Force colonel.
Crushed his lower spine

80
00:11:06,386 --> 00:11:09,433
in some kind of experimental armor.
Mid-thoracic vertebral fracture.

81
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:12,233
Well, I could help, but
so can 50 other people.

82
00:11:12,234 --> 00:11:14,034
Find me something worth my time.

83
00:11:14,044 --> 00:11:17,933
I have a 68-year-old female
with an advanced brain stem glioma.

84
00:11:17,934 --> 00:11:21,333
Yeah, you want me to screw up
my perfect record? Definitely not.

85
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:24,282
How about a 22-year-old
female with an electronic

86
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:27,316
implant in her brain to control
schizophrenia struck by lightning?

87
00:11:27,596 --> 00:11:29,296
That does sound interesting.

88
00:11:30,722 --> 00:11:32,530
Could you send me the... got it.

89
00:12:35,766 --> 00:12:37,466
Hey.

90
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,522
It's okay. It's going to be okay.

91
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,730
What did they do?

92
00:12:57,904 --> 00:13:03,219
They rushed you in a chopper.
But it took a little while to find you.

93
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,918
Golden hours for nerve damage went by
while you were in the car.

94
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,918
What did they do?!?

95
00:13:12,274 --> 00:13:15,417
11 stainless steel pins in the bones.

96
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,121
Multiple torn ligaments.

97
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,585
Severe nerve damage in both hands.

98
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:24,816
You were on the table for 11 hours.

99
00:13:24,886 --> 00:13:27,026
Look at these fixators.

100
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:31,115
No one could have done better.

101
00:13:36,563 --> 00:13:38,262
I could have done better.

102
00:14:06,693 --> 00:14:10,910
No. No.
- Give your body time to heal.

103
00:14:12,555 --> 00:14:14,609
You ruined me.

104
00:14:15,505 --> 00:14:17,258
How long until I'm...

105
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:20,408
Dr. Strange... those tissues
are still healing.

106
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:24,928
So speed it up. Pass the stent under the
brachial artery under the radial artery.

107
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:26,633
It's possible.

108
00:14:27,226 --> 00:14:30,207
Experimental and expensive, but possible.

109
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:31,981
All I need is possible.

110
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,599
Up.

111
00:14:57,944 --> 00:14:59,717
Up.

112
00:14:59,718 --> 00:15:01,418
Show me your strength.

113
00:15:06,402 --> 00:15:11,602
Ah! It's useless.
- It's not useless, man, you can do this.

114
00:15:12,343 --> 00:15:14,880
Then answer me this, bachelor's degree.

115
00:15:15,622 --> 00:15:19,600
Have you ever known anyone
with nerve damage this severe

116
00:15:19,601 --> 00:15:21,300
to do this, and actually recover?

117
00:15:21,301 --> 00:15:27,485
One guy, yeah. Factory accident, broke
his back. Paralyzed. His leg wasted away.

118
00:15:27,486 --> 00:15:30,269
He had pain in his shoulder
from the wheelchair.

119
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,599
He came in 3 times a week.

120
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,588
But one day he stopped coming.
I thought he was dead.

121
00:15:35,598 --> 00:15:38,396
A few years later, he
walked past me on the street.

122
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:42,697
He walked? - Yeah, he walked.
- Bullshit. Show me his file.

123
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:45,577
It can take me a while to pull
the files from the archive.

124
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:48,527
But if it proves your arrogant ass wrong,

125
00:15:48,536 --> 00:15:50,246
it's worth it.

126
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,494
I looked at all your research.

127
00:16:06,495 --> 00:16:10,734
I read all the papers you've sent,
but... none will work.

128
00:16:10,745 --> 00:16:14,592
I... I don't think you realize
how severe the damage is, I...

129
00:16:14,593 --> 00:16:16,693
Look, here's the thing, I...
- At best, I'd try and fail.

130
00:16:16,694 --> 00:16:19,382
Look, I understand.
Here's the thing. I...

131
00:16:19,383 --> 00:16:22,512
What you want from me is
impossible, Stephen. - Come on...

132
00:16:22,516 --> 00:16:25,048
I've got my own reputation to consider.
- Etienne, wait.

133
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:28,391
I can't help you...
- No. No, no, wait!

134
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:35,433
Hi.

135
00:16:41,212 --> 00:16:42,912
He won't do it.

136
00:16:45,016 --> 00:16:46,804
He's a hack.

137
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:51,623
There's a new procedure in Tokyo.
They culture donor stem cells

138
00:16:51,624 --> 00:16:53,807
and then harvest them and
3D-print a scaffold.

139
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:55,687
If I could get a loan
together, just...

140
00:16:55,688 --> 00:16:57,537
Stephen...
- A small loan, 200,000.

141
00:16:57,538 --> 00:17:00,190
Stephen. You've always spent money
as fast as you could make it

142
00:17:00,225 --> 00:17:02,384
but now you're spending money
you don't even have.

143
00:17:02,385 --> 00:17:04,886
Maybe it's time to consider stopping.

144
00:17:05,186 --> 00:17:08,786
No. Now is exactly the time not to stop.

145
00:17:08,787 --> 00:17:11,284
Because, you see,
I'm not getting any better!

146
00:17:11,285 --> 00:17:14,593
But this isn't medicine anymore.
This is mania.

147
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:17,634
Some things just can't be fixed.

148
00:17:17,684 --> 00:17:20,663
Life without my work...
- Is still life.

149
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:24,883
This isn't the end. There are other things
that can give your life meaning.

150
00:17:24,884 --> 00:17:26,583
Like what? Like you?

151
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,983
And this is the part where you apologize.

152
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,182
This is the part where you leave.

153
00:17:34,482 --> 00:17:37,381
Fine. I can't watch you
do this to yourself anymore.

154
00:17:37,382 --> 00:17:40,271
Too difficult for you, is it?
- Yes.

155
00:17:40,281 --> 00:17:44,281
It is. And it breaks my heart to see
you this way. - No. Don't pity me.

156
00:17:44,282 --> 00:17:46,883
I'm not pitying you.
- Oh yeah? Then what are you doing here?

157
00:17:46,884 --> 00:17:49,378
Bringing cheese and wine as if we're
old friends going for a picnic?

158
00:17:49,379 --> 00:17:51,389
We are not friends, Christine.
We were barely lovers.

159
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:55,379
You just love a sob story, don't you?
Is that what I am to you now?

160
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,019
Poor Stephen Strange, charity case.

161
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,638
He finally needs me. Another dreg
of humanity for you to work on.

162
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:04,388
Fix him up and send him back into
the world, heart is just humming...

163
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:07,678
You care so much! Don't you?!?

164
00:18:12,161 --> 00:18:13,944
Goodbye, Stephen.

165
00:18:47,979 --> 00:18:50,572
Told you so!

166
00:18:57,098 --> 00:19:00,369
Pangborn, J.
Metropolitan General Hospital

167
00:19:09,485 --> 00:19:11,969
Come on, man! Where is the competition?

168
00:19:13,015 --> 00:19:14,714
You talk a lot!

169
00:19:16,268 --> 00:19:20,668
Jonathan Pangborn, C7-C8 spinal
cord injury, complete.

170
00:19:20,972 --> 00:19:23,617
Who are you?
- Paralyzed from the mid-chest down.

171
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,357
Partial paralysis of both hands.

172
00:19:25,363 --> 00:19:26,367
I don't know you.

173
00:19:26,368 --> 00:19:30,666
I'm Stephen Strange. I'm a
neurosurgeon. Was a neurosurgeon.

174
00:19:31,281 --> 00:19:34,266
Actually, you know what, man?
I think I know you.

175
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:37,337
I came to your office once.
You refused to see me.

176
00:19:37,372 --> 00:19:39,153
I never got past your assistant.

177
00:19:40,422 --> 00:19:44,275
You were untreatable.
- No glory for you in that, right?

178
00:19:46,071 --> 00:19:49,363
You came back from a place
there is no way back from!

179
00:19:52,363 --> 00:19:55,513
I... I'm trying to find my own way back.

180
00:19:58,122 --> 00:20:00,562
Hey, Pangborn, you in it or not?

181
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,781
Alright.

182
00:20:10,661 --> 00:20:13,160
I'd given up on my body.

183
00:20:13,238 --> 00:20:15,631
I thought my mind was
the only thing I had

184
00:20:15,643 --> 00:20:18,160
left. I should at least
try to elevate that.

185
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,659
So I sat with gurus, and sacred women.

186
00:20:21,741 --> 00:20:24,890
Strangers carried me to mountain tops
to see holy men.

187
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:27,908
And finally, I found my teacher.

188
00:20:28,752 --> 00:20:33,158
And my mind was elevated.
And my spirit deepened.

189
00:20:33,812 --> 00:20:36,769
And somehow...
- Your body healed. - Yes.

190
00:20:38,757 --> 00:20:41,106
And there were deeper
secrets to learn then,

191
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:43,066
but I did not have the strength
to receive them.

192
00:20:43,077 --> 00:20:46,076
I chose to settle for my miracle,
and I came back home.

193
00:20:50,955 --> 00:20:53,945
The place you're looking for
is called Kamar-Taj.

194
00:20:54,155 --> 00:20:56,604
But the cost is high.
- How much?

195
00:20:57,326 --> 00:20:59,054
I'm not talking about money.

196
00:21:01,021 --> 00:21:02,774
Good luck.

197
00:21:03,826 --> 00:21:05,526
Give me the ball!

198
00:21:11,252 --> 00:21:13,652
Kathmandu, Nepal

199
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,949
Excuse me. Kamar-Taj?

200
00:21:29,774 --> 00:21:31,650
Do you know where Kamar-Taj is?

201
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,722
Sign: "Himalayan Healing!
Find Peace! Find Yourself!"

202
00:21:55,338 --> 00:21:57,038
Kamar-Taj?

203
00:21:58,146 --> 00:21:59,806
Kamar-Taj...

204
00:22:28,219 --> 00:22:29,919
Okay.

205
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:36,093
Guys, I... I don't have any money.
- Your watch.

206
00:22:36,144 --> 00:22:41,239
No, please. It's all I have left.
- Your watch.

207
00:22:43,777 --> 00:22:45,477
Alright.

208
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,541
You're looking for Kamar-Taj?

209
00:23:58,329 --> 00:24:01,329
Really? Are you sure
you got the right place?

210
00:24:02,128 --> 00:24:05,534
That one looks a little more...
Kamar-y Taj-y.

211
00:24:08,128 --> 00:24:10,327
I once stood in your place.

212
00:24:11,327 --> 00:24:14,827
And I, too, was... disrespectful.

213
00:24:15,927 --> 00:24:18,326
So might I offer you some advice?

214
00:24:19,127 --> 00:24:21,826
Forget everything you think you know.

215
00:24:24,241 --> 00:24:26,325
Uh... alright.

216
00:24:34,425 --> 00:24:38,524
The sanctuary of our teacher.
The Ancient One.

217
00:24:39,323 --> 00:24:41,891
The Ancient One?
What's his real name?

218
00:24:43,223 --> 00:24:46,823
Right. Forget everything I
think I know. I'm sorry.

219
00:24:57,748 --> 00:24:59,448
Thank you for... huh!

220
00:25:02,321 --> 00:25:04,317
Okay, that's, uh... a thing...

221
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,209
Thank you.

222
00:25:06,242 --> 00:25:08,035
Hello.

223
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,620
Uh, thank you.
And thank you.

224
00:25:12,117 --> 00:25:16,569
Uh, thank you, Ancient One...
for... seeing me...

225
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,019
You're very welcome.

226
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:24,621
The Ancient One. - Thank you, Master
Mordo. Thank you, Master Hamir!

227
00:25:25,632 --> 00:25:27,331
Mr. Strange!

228
00:25:27,414 --> 00:25:31,957
Doctor, actually.
- Well, no. Not anymore, surely.

229
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:36,516
Isn't that why you're here?
You've undergone many procedures.

230
00:25:36,517 --> 00:25:38,016
Seven, right?
- Yeah...

231
00:25:40,048 --> 00:25:41,747
Good tea.

232
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:50,144
Did you heal a man named
Pangborn? A paralyzed man.

233
00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:53,514
In a way.
- You helped him to walk again.

234
00:25:54,257 --> 00:25:59,113
Yes. - How do you correct a
complete C7-C8 spinal cord injury?

235
00:25:59,114 --> 00:26:01,513
Oh, I didn't correct it.

236
00:26:01,514 --> 00:26:03,812
He couldn't walk;
I convinced him that he could.

237
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:05,980
You're not suggesting
it was psychosomatic?

238
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:08,227
When you reattach a
severed nerve, is it you

239
00:26:08,239 --> 00:26:10,212
who heals it back
together or the body?

240
00:26:10,213 --> 00:26:13,105
It's the cells.
- And the cells are only programmed

241
00:26:13,117 --> 00:26:15,911
to put themselves together
in very specific ways.

242
00:26:15,912 --> 00:26:19,308
That's right. - What if I told you
that your own body could be convinced

243
00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:23,010
to put itself back together
in all sorts of ways?

244
00:26:23,203 --> 00:26:26,308
You're talking about
cellular regeneration.

245
00:26:26,603 --> 00:26:29,330
That's... bleeding-edge medical tech.

246
00:26:29,331 --> 00:26:32,599
Is that why you're working here,
without a governing medical board?

247
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,899
I mean... just how experimental
is your treatment?

248
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:37,862
Quite.

249
00:26:38,036 --> 00:26:43,207
So, you figured out a way to
reprogram nerve cells to self-heal?

250
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:44,644
No, Mr. Strange.

251
00:26:45,977 --> 00:26:50,305
I know how to reorient the spirit
to better heal the body.

252
00:26:52,262 --> 00:26:55,505
Spirit... to heal the body.

253
00:26:57,271 --> 00:27:01,505
Huh. A... Al... Al... alright.
How do we do that? Where do we start?

254
00:27:07,204 --> 00:27:08,304
Don't like that map?

255
00:27:08,305 --> 00:27:11,704
Oh, no. It's... it's very good.
It's just...

256
00:27:11,716 --> 00:27:15,203
you know, I've seen it before.
In gift shops.

257
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:20,301
And what about this one?
- Acupuncture, great. - Yeah?

258
00:27:21,004 --> 00:27:22,902
What about... that one?

259
00:27:22,903 --> 00:27:25,786
You're showing me an MRI scan?
I can not believe this.

260
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:30,741
Each of those maps was drawn up by someone
who could see in part, but not the whole.

261
00:27:30,747 --> 00:27:33,630
I spent my last dollar getting here

262
00:27:33,631 --> 00:27:37,030
on a one-way ticket, and you're talking
to me about healing through belief?

263
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:39,799
You're a man who's looking
at the world through a keyhole,

264
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,622
and you spent your whole life
trying to widen that keyhole.

265
00:27:42,624 --> 00:27:47,478
To see more, know more. And now,
on hearing that it can be widened

266
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,098
in ways you can't imagine,
you reject the possibility?

267
00:27:51,099 --> 00:27:54,282
No, I reject it because I do
not believe in fairy tales

268
00:27:54,294 --> 00:27:57,147
about chakras, or energy,
or the power of belief.

269
00:27:57,148 --> 00:27:59,757
There is no such thing as spirit!

270
00:27:59,769 --> 00:28:03,096
We are made of matter, and nothing more.

271
00:28:03,107 --> 00:28:07,736
We're just another tiny, momentary speck
within an indifferent universe.

272
00:28:07,738 --> 00:28:11,445
You think too little of yourself.
- Oh, you think you see through me, do you?

273
00:28:11,446 --> 00:28:15,814
Well, you don't. But I see through you!!!

274
00:28:33,288 --> 00:28:37,249
What did you just do to me?!? - I pushed
your astral form out of your physical form.

275
00:28:37,284 --> 00:28:40,511
What's in that tea? Psilocybin? LSD?

276
00:28:40,521 --> 00:28:42,317
Just tea.

277
00:28:42,351 --> 00:28:44,141
With a little honey.

278
00:28:44,142 --> 00:28:48,240
What just happened? - For a moment,
you entered the astral dimension.

279
00:28:48,242 --> 00:28:51,989
What?? - A place where the soul
exists apart from the body.

280
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:57,288
Why are you doing this to me?
- To show you just how much you don't know.

281
00:28:57,389 --> 00:28:59,538
Open your eye.

282
00:29:00,888 --> 00:29:05,988
No! No... No! Shit!

283
00:29:05,989 --> 00:29:11,130
Oh god! Oh god! Oh god!

284
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:14,130
This isn't real it isn't real it isn't

285
00:29:24,674 --> 00:29:26,922
His heart rate are getting
dangerously high.

286
00:29:32,305 --> 00:29:34,005
He looks alright to me.

287
00:29:35,883 --> 00:29:39,083
You think you know how the world works?

288
00:29:39,084 --> 00:29:42,783
You think that this material
universe is all there is?

289
00:29:46,872 --> 00:29:48,782
What is real?

290
00:29:50,979 --> 00:29:54,081
What mysteries lie beyond
the reach of your senses?

291
00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:00,763
At the root of existence,
mind and matter meet.

292
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,780
Thoughts shape reality.

293
00:30:17,588 --> 00:30:21,177
This universe is only one
of an infinite number.

294
00:30:23,508 --> 00:30:25,477
Worlds without end.

295
00:30:26,505 --> 00:30:29,275
Some benevolent and life-giving;

296
00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:35,274
Others filled with malice and hunger.

297
00:30:38,246 --> 00:30:44,474
Dark places, where powers
older than time lie...

298
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:47,983
ravenous... and waiting.

299
00:30:54,916 --> 00:31:01,171
Who are you in this vast multiverse,
Mr. Strange?

300
00:31:21,268 --> 00:31:24,469
Have you seen that before in a gift shop?

301
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:32,968
Teach me!

302
00:31:35,087 --> 00:31:36,787
No.

303
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,390
No... No!

304
00:31:43,941 --> 00:31:45,916
No, no, no, no no no no!

305
00:31:48,296 --> 00:31:52,065
No! Open the door! Please!

306
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,770
Thank you, Masters.

307
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,063
You think I'm wrong to cast him out?

308
00:32:04,064 --> 00:32:06,763
5 hours later, he's still on your doorstep.

309
00:32:07,455 --> 00:32:09,544
There's a strength to him.

310
00:32:09,545 --> 00:32:14,472
Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition...
I've seen it all before.

311
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:17,061
He reminds you of Kaecilius?

312
00:32:17,062 --> 00:32:19,901
I can not lead another
gifted student to power,

313
00:32:19,902 --> 00:32:22,011
only to lose him to the darkness.

314
00:32:23,802 --> 00:32:28,398
You didn't lose me. I wanted
the power to defeat my enemies.

315
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,159
You gave me the power
to defeat my demons.

316
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,459
And to live within the natural law.

317
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,759
We never lose our demons, Mordo.

318
00:32:38,562 --> 00:32:40,558
We only learn to live above them.

319
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:46,157
Kaecilius still has the stolen pages.

320
00:32:46,238 --> 00:32:49,657
If he deciphers them,
he could bring ruin upon us all.

321
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,807
There may be dark days ahead.

322
00:32:53,296 --> 00:32:56,406
Perhaps Kamar-Taj could
use a man like Strange.

323
00:33:06,344 --> 00:33:08,154
Don't shut me out.

324
00:33:11,285 --> 00:33:14,154
I've nowhere else to go.

325
00:33:18,259 --> 00:33:19,959
Thank you.

326
00:33:24,434 --> 00:33:26,134
Bed.

327
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,500
Rest.

328
00:33:28,772 --> 00:33:30,471
Meditate...

329
00:33:30,534 --> 00:33:32,234
if you can.

330
00:33:32,525 --> 00:33:34,531
The Ancient One will send for you.

331
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,550
Uh, what's this? My mantra?

332
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:48,049
The Wi-Fi password.

333
00:33:49,033 --> 00:33:50,749
We're not savages.

334
00:34:11,437 --> 00:34:15,765
Time will tell how much I love you.
- Christine

335
00:34:22,407 --> 00:34:26,594
The language of the mystic arts
is as old as civilization.

336
00:34:27,662 --> 00:34:32,242
The sorcerers of antiquity called
the use of this language "spells".

337
00:34:32,813 --> 00:34:35,742
But if that word offends
your modern sensibilities,

338
00:34:35,743 --> 00:34:37,156
you can call it "program".

339
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,492
The source code that shapes reality.

340
00:34:41,187 --> 00:34:43,791
We harness energy

341
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:47,941
drawn from other dimensions
of the multiverse,

342
00:34:49,426 --> 00:34:51,190
to cast spells,

343
00:34:52,772 --> 00:34:55,239
conjure shields

344
00:34:55,658 --> 00:34:57,440
and weapons

345
00:34:58,536 --> 00:35:00,589
to make magic.

346
00:35:14,337 --> 00:35:18,236
But... even if my fingers could do that,

347
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:21,836
My hands would just be
waving in the air. I mean,

348
00:35:21,854 --> 00:35:23,936
how do I get from here to there?

349
00:35:23,937 --> 00:35:26,446
How did you get to
reattach severed nerves,

350
00:35:26,447 --> 00:35:30,415
and put a human spine
back together bone by bone?

351
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:32,735
Study and practice. Years of it.

352
00:35:41,321 --> 00:35:43,020
Hey.

353
00:35:45,906 --> 00:35:49,082
Mr. Strange.
- Uh... Stephen, please.

354
00:35:49,443 --> 00:35:52,143
- And you are?
- Wong. - Wong.

355
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:56,131
Just Wong? Like... Adele?

356
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:00,081
Or... Aristotle.

357
00:36:01,497 --> 00:36:03,930
Drake. Bono.

358
00:36:06,712 --> 00:36:08,530
Eminem.

359
00:36:11,604 --> 00:36:13,529
The book of the invisible sun.

360
00:36:14,336 --> 00:36:16,119
Astronomia Nova.

361
00:36:16,471 --> 00:36:18,220
Codex Imperium.

362
00:36:18,524 --> 00:36:20,278
Key of Solomon.

363
00:36:22,149 --> 00:36:24,618
You finished all of this?
- Yup.

364
00:36:25,662 --> 00:36:28,007
Come with me.
- Alright.

365
00:36:29,051 --> 00:36:31,138
This section is for Masters only.

366
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,516
But at my discretion,
others may use it.

367
00:36:34,669 --> 00:36:36,516
We should start with Maxim's Primer.

368
00:36:40,305 --> 00:36:42,075
How is your Sanskrit?

369
00:36:42,857 --> 00:36:45,115
I'm fluent in Google Translate.

370
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:48,424
Read it. Classical Sanskrit.

371
00:36:52,753 --> 00:36:54,524
What are those?

372
00:36:54,549 --> 00:36:56,923
The Ancient One's private collection.

373
00:36:57,504 --> 00:36:59,204
So they're forbidden?

374
00:36:59,254 --> 00:37:02,842
No knowledge in Kamar-Taj is forbidden.
Only certain practices.

375
00:37:05,267 --> 00:37:09,401
Those books are far too advanced for
anyone other than the Sorcerer Supreme.

376
00:37:20,473 --> 00:37:22,270
This one's got pages missing.

377
00:37:22,776 --> 00:37:26,299
That's the book of Cagliostro.
The study of time.

378
00:37:26,724 --> 00:37:29,339
One of the rituals was
stolen by a former Master.

379
00:37:30,763 --> 00:37:33,018
A zealot called Kaecilius.

380
00:37:34,584 --> 00:37:37,213
Just after he strung up
the former librarian,

381
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:39,677
and relieved him of his head.

382
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:44,617
I'm now the guardian of these books.

383
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:49,816
So if a volume from this collection
should be stolen again, I'd know it.

384
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:53,166
And you'd be dead before
you ever left the compound.

385
00:37:56,624 --> 00:37:58,714
What if it's just overdue? You know?

386
00:37:59,096 --> 00:38:02,313
Any... late fees I should know about?
Maybe, perhaps, uhm...

387
00:38:05,544 --> 00:38:08,214
Uh, you know, people used
to think that I was funny.

388
00:38:08,215 --> 00:38:09,713
Did they work for you?

389
00:38:09,714 --> 00:38:13,011
Alright. Well, it's been
lovely talking to you, thank

390
00:38:13,023 --> 00:38:15,902
you for the books and for
the horrifying story

391
00:38:15,903 --> 00:38:18,723
and for the threat upon my life.

392
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,627
Now we receive the power to destroy
the one who betrayed us.

393
00:38:55,224 --> 00:38:57,257
The one who betrays the world.

394
00:39:56,649 --> 00:40:00,278
Mastery of the sling ring is
essential to the mystic arts.

395
00:40:00,721 --> 00:40:03,548
They allow us to travel
throughout the multiverse.

396
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,196
All you need to do is focus.

397
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:08,196
Visualize.

398
00:40:08,216 --> 00:40:10,747
See the destination in your mind.

399
00:40:11,636 --> 00:40:14,416
Look beyond the world in front of you.

400
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,656
Imagine every detail.

401
00:40:18,548 --> 00:40:23,194
The clearer the picture,
the quicker, and easier,

402
00:40:23,207 --> 00:40:25,315
the gateway will come.

403
00:40:28,423 --> 00:40:30,144
And stop.

404
00:40:30,354 --> 00:40:33,360
I'd like a moment alone
with Mr. Strange.

405
00:40:33,361 --> 00:40:35,083
Of course.

406
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:41,347
My hands.
- It's not about your hands.

407
00:40:41,348 --> 00:40:43,191
How is this not about my hands?

408
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:44,942
Master Hamir.

409
00:40:58,733 --> 00:41:00,489
Thank you, Master Hamir.

410
00:41:01,473 --> 00:41:03,689
You cannot beat a river into submission.

411
00:41:04,676 --> 00:41:09,099
You have to surrender to its current,
and use its power as your own.

412
00:41:09,403 --> 00:41:12,540
I... I control it by surrendering control?
That doesn't make any sense.

413
00:41:12,541 --> 00:41:15,748
Not everything does.
Not everything has to.

414
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:18,877
Your intellect has
taken you far in life.

415
00:41:18,886 --> 00:41:20,616
But it will take you no further.

416
00:41:20,705 --> 00:41:22,447
Surrender, Stephen.

417
00:41:22,991 --> 00:41:24,707
Silence your ego

418
00:41:25,311 --> 00:41:27,046
and your power will rise.

419
00:41:27,925 --> 00:41:29,641
Come with me.

420
00:41:34,557 --> 00:41:36,910
Wait. Is this...
- Everest.

421
00:41:39,056 --> 00:41:45,444
It's beautiful. - Yeah, you're right.
Beautiful. It's freezing, but... beautiful.

422
00:41:45,515 --> 00:41:49,683
At this temperature,
a person can last for 13 minutes

423
00:41:49,684 --> 00:41:53,183
before suffering permanent
loss of function. - Great.

424
00:41:53,184 --> 00:41:58,182
But you will likely go into shock
within the first 2 minutes. - What?

425
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:01,181
Surrender, Stephen.
- No, no!!! Don't!

426
00:42:10,229 --> 00:42:13,330
How is our new recruit?
- We shall see.

427
00:42:13,837 --> 00:42:15,580
Any second now.

428
00:42:17,799 --> 00:42:19,559
No, not again.

429
00:42:24,385 --> 00:42:26,228
Maybe I should...

430
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:41,928
Stephen.
- Wong.

431
00:43:42,018 --> 00:43:45,047
What do you want, Strange?
- Books on astral projection.

432
00:43:45,517 --> 00:43:48,537
You're not ready for that.
- Try me, Beyoncé.

433
00:43:52,126 --> 00:43:55,526
Come on. You've heard of her.
She's a huge star, right?

434
00:43:57,486 --> 00:43:59,315
Do you ever laugh?

435
00:44:00,085 --> 00:44:01,835
Oh come on, just
give me the book, huh?

436
00:44:02,435 --> 00:44:04,150
No.

437
00:44:31,061 --> 00:44:35,710
Once, in this room,
you begged me to let you learn.

438
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:40,060
Now I'm told you question every lesson,
prefering to teach yourself.

439
00:44:40,061 --> 00:44:42,960
Once, in this room,
you told me to open my eyes.

440
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:45,749
Now I'm being told to blindly
accept rules that make no sense.

441
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:49,158
Like the rule against conjuring
a gateway in the library?

442
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:52,658
Wong told on me? - You're advancing
quickly with your sorcery skills.

443
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:55,868
You need a safe space
to practice your spells.

444
00:45:14,475 --> 00:45:16,375
You are now inside the Mirror Dimension.

445
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:18,755
Ever present but undetected.

446
00:45:19,915 --> 00:45:22,257
The real world isn't affected
by what happens here.

447
00:45:23,057 --> 00:45:26,525
We use the Mirror Dimension
to train, surveil,

448
00:45:27,413 --> 00:45:29,694
and sometimes to contain threats.

449
00:45:29,904 --> 00:45:32,606
You don't want to be stuck
in here without your sling ring.

450
00:45:32,641 --> 00:45:35,604
Hold on. Sorry, what
do you mean, threats?

451
00:45:44,964 --> 00:45:47,236
Learning of an infinite multiverse

452
00:45:47,237 --> 00:45:49,537
included learning of infinite dangers.

453
00:45:49,572 --> 00:45:51,861
And if I told you everything
else that you don't

454
00:45:51,873 --> 00:45:53,987
already know, you'd run
from here in terror.

455
00:45:59,907 --> 00:46:02,380
So, just how ancient is she?

456
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:06,936
No one knows the age of
the Sorcerer Supreme.

457
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:10,999
Only that she is Celtic
and never talks about her past.

458
00:46:11,057 --> 00:46:12,762
You follow her even though you don't know?

459
00:46:12,963 --> 00:46:15,277
I know that she's steadfast,
but unpredictable.

460
00:46:15,681 --> 00:46:17,381
Merciless, yet kind.

461
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:20,408
She made me what I am.

462
00:46:22,433 --> 00:46:25,645
Trust your teacher.
And don't lose your way.

463
00:46:25,695 --> 00:46:28,304
Like Kaecilius?
- That's right.

464
00:46:33,518 --> 00:46:35,218
You knew him.

465
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,161
When he first came to us,
he'd lost everyone he ever loved.

466
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:40,908
He was a grieving and broken man,

467
00:46:40,909 --> 00:46:43,204
searching for answers in the mystic arts.

468
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:46,699
A brilliant student, but
he was proud, headstrong.

469
00:46:46,808 --> 00:46:49,383
Questioned the Ancient One,
rejected our teaching.

470
00:46:56,617 --> 00:46:58,317
He left Kamar-Taj.

471
00:46:58,532 --> 00:47:01,157
His disciples followed him like sheep

472
00:47:01,158 --> 00:47:03,401
seduced by false doctrine.

473
00:47:03,436 --> 00:47:06,499
He stole the forbidden ritual, right?
- Yeah.

474
00:47:07,138 --> 00:47:08,838
What did it do?

475
00:47:10,629 --> 00:47:12,329
No more questions.

476
00:47:13,241 --> 00:47:15,660
What's that?
- That's a question.

477
00:47:17,332 --> 00:47:19,032
This is a relic.

478
00:47:19,302 --> 00:47:22,628
Some magic is too powerful to sustain,
so we imbue objects with it.

479
00:47:23,851 --> 00:47:26,140
Allowing them to take
the strain we can not.

480
00:47:26,311 --> 00:47:30,887
This is the Staff of the Living Tribunal.

481
00:47:34,482 --> 00:47:36,182
There are many relics.

482
00:47:36,198 --> 00:47:37,898
The Wand of Watoomb.

483
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:39,676
The Bolting Boots of Voltor.

484
00:47:39,677 --> 00:47:43,812
They just roll of the tongue, don't they?
When do I get my relic?

485
00:47:43,813 --> 00:47:46,324
When you're ready.
- I think I'm ready.

486
00:47:46,359 --> 00:47:48,943
You're ready when the relic
decides you're ready.

487
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:51,430
For now,

488
00:47:52,425 --> 00:47:54,124
conjure a weapon.

489
00:47:54,762 --> 00:47:56,650
Yeah.

490
00:48:02,543 --> 00:48:06,484
Fight! Fight like
your life depended on it!

491
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:14,822
Because one day, it may.

492
00:48:35,191 --> 00:48:38,274
Christine

493
00:48:42,351 --> 00:48:46,926
I'm emailing you one more time to

494
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:27,262
Wong?

495
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:40,730
Okay.

496
00:49:40,731 --> 00:49:43,747
First, open the Eye of Agamotto.

497
00:50:04,185 --> 00:50:05,884
Alright.

498
00:50:29,295 --> 00:50:30,995
Oh my.

499
00:51:07,891 --> 00:51:09,591
Dormammu.

500
00:51:11,059 --> 00:51:12,759
The Dark Dimension.

501
00:51:13,394 --> 00:51:15,094
Eternal life?

502
00:51:21,093 --> 00:51:22,793
Stop!!!

503
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:28,093
Tampering with the continuum
of probability is forbidden!

504
00:51:28,128 --> 00:51:30,450
I... I wa... I was just doing
exactly what it said in the book!

505
00:51:30,474 --> 00:51:33,772
And what did the book say about
the dangers of performing that ritual?

506
00:51:33,807 --> 00:51:35,674
Yeah, I don't know. I hadn't
gotten to that part yet.

507
00:51:35,691 --> 00:51:38,275
Temporal manipulations can
create branches in time.

508
00:51:38,921 --> 00:51:40,719
Unstable dimensional openings.

509
00:51:40,754 --> 00:51:43,596
Spacious paradoxes! Time loops!!!

510
00:51:43,645 --> 00:51:46,914
You want to get stuck reliving the
same moment over, and over, forever,

511
00:51:46,949 --> 00:51:48,648
or never having existed at all?

512
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,720
They really should put the
warnings before that stuff.

513
00:51:51,779 --> 00:51:53,686
Your curiosity could
have gotten you killed.

514
00:51:54,061 --> 00:51:56,275
You weren't manipulating
the space-time continuum,

515
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:58,405
you were wrecking it.

516
00:51:58,735 --> 00:52:02,180
We do not tamper with
natural law. We defend it.

517
00:52:02,193 --> 00:52:03,893
How did you learn to do that?

518
00:52:05,113 --> 00:52:08,021
Where did you learn the litany of spells
required to even understand it?

519
00:52:08,056 --> 00:52:11,598
I've got a photographic memory. It's how I
got my M.D. and Ph.D. at the same time.

520
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:15,598
What you just did
takes more than a good memory.

521
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,096
You were born for the mystic arts.

522
00:52:17,313 --> 00:52:20,646
And yet, my hands still shake.
- For now, yes.

523
00:52:20,681 --> 00:52:23,213
Not forever?
- We're not prophets.

524
00:52:23,248 --> 00:52:25,426
When do you start telling me what we are?

525
00:52:30,831 --> 00:52:34,748
While heroes like the Avengers
protect the world from physical dangers,

526
00:52:35,157 --> 00:52:38,058
we sorcerers safeguard it
against more mystical threats.

527
00:52:39,475 --> 00:52:43,250
The Ancient One is the latest
in a long line of Sorcerers Supreme

528
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:46,856
Going back thousands of years
to the father of the mystic arts,

529
00:52:46,891 --> 00:52:48,591
the mighty Agamotto.

530
00:52:49,534 --> 00:52:53,445
The same sorcerer who created the eye
you so recklessly borrowed.

531
00:52:54,752 --> 00:52:57,809
Agamotto built 3 Sanctums
in places of power,

532
00:52:57,844 --> 00:53:00,397
where great cities now stand.

533
00:53:00,432 --> 00:53:02,487
That door leads to the Hong Kong Sanctum,

534
00:53:03,846 --> 00:53:05,546
that door to the New York Sanctum.

535
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:08,048
That one, to the London Sanctum.

536
00:53:08,399 --> 00:53:12,797
Together, the Sanctums generate a
protective shield around our world.

537
00:53:13,722 --> 00:53:17,185
The Sanctums protect the
world, and we sorcerers

538
00:53:17,592 --> 00:53:20,599
protect the Sanctums.
- From what?

539
00:53:20,634 --> 00:53:23,696
Other-dimensional beings
that threaten our universe.

540
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:26,239
Like Dormammu?

541
00:53:27,024 --> 00:53:28,724
Where did you learn that name?

542
00:53:29,669 --> 00:53:32,241
I just read it in the book
of Cagliostro. Why?

543
00:53:37,741 --> 00:53:39,441
Dormammu dwells in the Dark Dimension.

544
00:53:41,145 --> 00:53:42,845
Beyond time.

545
00:53:43,218 --> 00:53:47,287
He is the cosmic conquerer,
the destroyer of worlds.

546
00:53:47,714 --> 00:53:50,493
A being of infinite power
and endless hunger,

547
00:53:51,554 --> 00:53:53,564
on a quest to invade every universe

548
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:56,459
and bring all worlds into
his Dark Dimension.

549
00:53:57,572 --> 00:53:59,895
And he hungers for Earth most of all.

550
00:54:01,442 --> 00:54:03,223
The pages that Kaecilius stole.

551
00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:07,485
A ritual to contact Dormammu and
draw power from the Dark Dimension.

552
00:54:11,789 --> 00:54:13,489
Uuuh... okay. Okay.

553
00:54:15,366 --> 00:54:19,494
I... time-out. I... I came
here to heal my hands,

554
00:54:20,237 --> 00:54:23,918
not to fight in some mystical war.

555
00:54:26,279 --> 00:54:27,979
London.

556
00:54:31,266 --> 00:54:32,973
Kaecilius!

557
00:54:32,974 --> 00:54:34,674
No!!!

558
00:54:40,167 --> 00:54:41,867
Wong? Mordo?

559
00:55:18,621 --> 00:55:20,320
177A Bleecker Street

560
00:55:32,907 --> 00:55:34,606
Hello?

561
00:56:03,468 --> 00:56:05,167
Hello?

562
00:56:43,205 --> 00:56:46,566
Daniel. I see they made you
Master of the Sanctum.

563
00:56:47,872 --> 00:56:49,572
Do you know what that means?

564
00:56:50,408 --> 00:56:52,108
That you'll die protecting it.

565
00:57:08,331 --> 00:57:10,030
Stop!

566
00:57:20,711 --> 00:57:22,960
How long have you been
at Kamar-TaJ, Mister...?

567
00:57:23,244 --> 00:57:24,943
Doctor.

568
00:57:25,796 --> 00:57:28,998
- Just Doctor?
- It's Strange.

569
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:33,301
Maybe. Who am I to judge?

570
00:59:57,909 --> 00:59:59,896
You don't know how to use that, do you?

571
01:01:44,984 --> 01:01:46,684
What?

572
01:01:50,019 --> 01:01:52,519
You'll die here.
- Oh, stop it.

573
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,073
I said, stop it!

574
01:01:54,108 --> 01:01:57,555
You cannot stop this, Mr. Doctor. - Why...
look, I don't even know what "this" is.

575
01:01:58,191 --> 01:02:01,249
It's the end and the beginning.

576
01:02:01,307 --> 01:02:03,902
The many becoming the few,
becoming the One.

577
01:02:05,695 --> 01:02:07,327
Look, if you're not going
to start making sense,

578
01:02:07,339 --> 01:02:09,017
I'm just going to have to
put this thing back on.

579
01:02:09,018 --> 01:02:10,191
Tell me, Mr. Doctor.

580
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:13,411
Alright, look. My name
is Dr. Stephen Strange.

581
01:02:13,446 --> 01:02:16,624
You are a doctor?
- Yes. - A scientist.

582
01:02:17,282 --> 01:02:22,137
You understand the laws of nature.
All things age. All things die.

583
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:25,874
In the end, our sun burns out,
our universe grows cold and perishes.

584
01:02:26,755 --> 01:02:28,551
But the Dark Dimension...

585
01:02:28,947 --> 01:02:30,659
it's a place beyond time.

586
01:02:30,694 --> 01:02:34,119
That's it. I'm putting this thing back on.
This world doesn't have to die, Doctor.

587
01:02:34,154 --> 01:02:37,087
This world can take its rightful
place among so many others,

588
01:02:37,122 --> 01:02:38,821
as part of the One.

589
01:02:39,068 --> 01:02:40,768
The great and beautiful One.

590
01:02:41,751 --> 01:02:43,451
And we can all live forever.

591
01:02:43,765 --> 01:02:45,465
Really?

592
01:02:47,181 --> 01:02:50,519
What do you have to gain out of
this New Age dimensional utopia?

593
01:02:51,352 --> 01:02:54,942
The same as you. The same as
everyone. Life. Eternal life.

594
01:02:56,042 --> 01:02:58,053
People think in terms of good and evil,

595
01:02:58,088 --> 01:03:01,460
but really, time is the true enemy
of us all. Time kills everything.

596
01:03:01,461 --> 01:03:03,359
What about the people you killed?

597
01:03:03,394 --> 01:03:07,493
Tiny, momentary specks within
an indifferent universe.

598
01:03:09,456 --> 01:03:11,156
Yes. You see,

599
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:13,983
you see what we're doing?

600
01:03:14,926 --> 01:03:18,688
The world is not what it ought to be.
Humanity longs for the eternal,

601
01:03:19,145 --> 01:03:21,582
for a world beyond time, because
time is what enslaves us.

602
01:03:21,617 --> 01:03:23,754
Time is an insult.

603
01:03:24,375 --> 01:03:26,238
Death is an insult.

604
01:03:27,284 --> 01:03:28,984
Doctor...

605
01:03:29,555 --> 01:03:31,741
We don't seek to rule this world.

606
01:03:31,776 --> 01:03:34,664
We seek to save it, to
hand it over to Dormammu,

607
01:03:34,699 --> 01:03:37,248
who is the intent of all evolution,

608
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:39,710
the Why of all existence.

609
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:43,492
The Sorcerer Supreme defends existence.

610
01:03:45,128 --> 01:03:49,164
What was it that brought you to Kamar-Taj,
Doctor? Was it enlightenment?

611
01:03:49,874 --> 01:03:51,574
Power?

612
01:03:52,846 --> 01:03:55,185
You came to be healed, as did we all.

613
01:03:57,202 --> 01:03:59,854
Kamar-Taj is a place that
collects broken things.

614
01:03:59,859 --> 01:04:01,687
We all come with the
promise of being healed,

615
01:04:01,722 --> 01:04:04,467
but instead, the Ancient One
gives us parlor tricks.

616
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:08,150
The real magic she keeps for herself.

617
01:04:08,185 --> 01:04:11,556
Have you ever wondered how she
managed to live this long?

618
01:04:15,999 --> 01:04:19,170
I... I saw the rituals in
the book of Cagliostro.

619
01:04:19,205 --> 01:04:21,830
So, you know.

620
01:04:21,865 --> 01:04:26,974
The ritual gives me the power to overthrow
the Ancient One and tear her Sanctums down,

621
01:04:27,009 --> 01:04:29,488
to let the Dark Dimension in.

622
01:04:30,044 --> 01:04:33,399
Because what the Ancient One
hoards, Dormammu gives freely.

623
01:04:34,603 --> 01:04:36,302
Life, everlasting.

624
01:04:36,944 --> 01:04:40,268
He is not the destroyer of worlds,
Doctor, he is the savior of worlds.

625
01:04:42,162 --> 01:04:44,995
No. I mean, come on.
Look at your face.

626
01:04:45,694 --> 01:04:47,879
Dormammu made you a murderer.

627
01:04:48,096 --> 01:04:50,548
Just how good can his kingdom be?

628
01:04:52,397 --> 01:04:54,097
You think that's funny?

629
01:04:54,372 --> 01:04:56,072
No. No, Doctor.

630
01:04:56,201 --> 01:04:58,758
What's funny is that you've
lost your sling ring.

631
01:06:06,879 --> 01:06:09,375
Sir, can I help you?
- Dr. Palmer, where is she?

632
01:06:09,477 --> 01:06:12,366
Sir, we need to... - Where is she?
- At the nurses station.

633
01:06:12,538 --> 01:06:14,238
Christine!

634
01:06:15,835 --> 01:06:18,424
Stephen? Oh my god. What...
- We need to get

635
01:06:18,436 --> 01:06:20,749
me on an operation table now.
Just you.

636
01:06:20,922 --> 01:06:22,622
Now! I don't have any time!

637
01:06:22,974 --> 01:06:26,477
What happened?
- Stabbed. Cardiac tamponade.

638
01:06:27,856 --> 01:06:29,556
What are you wearing?

639
01:06:35,769 --> 01:06:40,516
The chest cavity is clear.
- The blood... is in the pericardial sac.

640
01:06:42,588 --> 01:06:44,893
No. No no no no no no no!
Stephen! Stephen!

641
01:07:13,469 --> 01:07:15,169
Just a little higher.

642
01:07:16,735 --> 01:07:18,434
Please be careful with the needle.

643
01:07:20,266 --> 01:07:21,966
Stephen?

644
01:07:22,974 --> 01:07:26,736
Oh lord, oh lord. What am I seeing?
- My astral body.

645
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:31,076
Are you dead?
- No, Christine, but I am dying.

646
01:07:33,418 --> 01:07:35,548
Right. Right.

647
01:07:36,893 --> 01:07:40,269
Yeah. Alright.

648
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:51,295
I've... I've never seen
a wound like this before.

649
01:07:51,622 --> 01:07:53,322
What were you stabbed with?

650
01:07:53,762 --> 01:07:55,462
I don't know.

651
01:08:14,531 --> 01:08:17,232
I'm going to have to vanish now.
- No, I...

652
01:08:17,774 --> 01:08:19,474
Keep me alive, will you?

653
01:08:22,548 --> 01:08:24,438
Okay! Okay.

654
01:08:49,097 --> 01:08:50,797
Oh shit!

655
01:09:21,082 --> 01:09:22,781
Charging to 200 Joule

656
01:09:33,842 --> 01:09:35,542
Stephen, come on.

657
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:40,879
Hit me again!
- Stop doing that!

658
01:09:40,914 --> 01:09:42,759
Up the voltage and hit me again.

659
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:45,104
No, your heart is beating!
- Just do it!

660
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:18,610
Oh god!

661
01:10:18,711 --> 01:10:20,480
Are you ok?
- Hey there.

662
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:23,640
Okay.

663
01:10:28,911 --> 01:10:32,557
After all this time,
you just show up here,

664
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:37,994
flying out of your body?
- Yeah, I know.

665
01:10:38,707 --> 01:10:40,407
I missed you too, by the way.

666
01:10:42,102 --> 01:10:44,552
I wrote 2 emails, but
you never responded.

667
01:10:44,587 --> 01:10:46,287
Why would I?

668
01:10:47,216 --> 01:10:49,168
Christine, I am so, so sorry.

669
01:10:50,441 --> 01:10:52,143
For all of it.
And you were right,

670
01:10:52,178 --> 01:10:55,998
I was a complete asshole.
I treated you so horribly

671
01:10:56,033 --> 01:11:00,226
and you deserved so much more.
- Stop. You... you're clearly in shock.

672
01:11:02,015 --> 01:11:03,714
I mean, what the hell is happening?

673
01:11:04,643 --> 01:11:06,343
Where have you been?

674
01:11:06,608 --> 01:11:09,793
Well, after Western medicine failed me,

675
01:11:09,828 --> 01:11:12,742
I headed East, and I
ended up in Kathmandu.

676
01:11:12,777 --> 01:11:15,252
Kathmandu?
- Yeah.

677
01:11:16,442 --> 01:11:20,344
What, like the Bob Seger song?
- 1975, Beautiful Loser, side A. And then,

678
01:11:20,379 --> 01:11:22,141
I went to a place called Kamar-Taj

679
01:11:22,142 --> 01:11:27,556
and I talked to someone
called the Ancient One, and...

680
01:11:28,838 --> 01:11:32,042
Oh. So you joined a cult.
- No, I didn't. Not exactly. I mean,

681
01:11:32,077 --> 01:11:35,150
they did teach me to tap into powers
that I never even knew existed.

682
01:11:35,185 --> 01:11:37,500
Yeah, that sounds like a cult.
- It's not a cult.

683
01:11:37,772 --> 01:11:40,807
Well, that's what a cultist would say.
- Oh, no.

684
01:11:41,358 --> 01:11:43,817
Wait, Stephen... what do
you think you're doing?

685
01:11:43,852 --> 01:11:45,552
I'm late for a cult meeting.

686
01:11:49,671 --> 01:11:51,471
This is insane.
- Yeah.

687
01:11:51,506 --> 01:11:53,512
Where are you going?

688
01:11:53,918 --> 01:11:55,620
Uhm...
- Just tell me the truth?

689
01:11:55,621 --> 01:11:59,759
Well, a powerful sorcerer, who gave
himself over to an ancient entity

690
01:11:59,767 --> 01:12:02,426
who can bend the very laws of physics,
tried very hard to kill me,

691
01:12:02,431 --> 01:12:04,393
but I left him chained up
in Greenwich Village,

692
01:12:04,398 --> 01:12:06,521
and the quickest way back there
is through a dimensional gateway

693
01:12:06,522 --> 01:12:10,645
that I opened up in the mop closet.
- Okay. Don't tell me. Fine.

694
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:23,111
I really do have to go.

695
01:13:10,387 --> 01:13:12,087
Strange!

696
01:13:14,194 --> 01:13:17,874
You're okay.
- A relative term, but yeah, I'm okay.

697
01:13:18,705 --> 01:13:20,405
The Cloak of Levitation.

698
01:13:21,425 --> 01:13:23,124
It came to you.

699
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,260
No minor feat.

700
01:13:25,949 --> 01:13:27,649
It's a fickle thing.

701
01:13:27,725 --> 01:13:29,880
He's escaped.
- Kaecilius? - Yeah.

702
01:13:31,202 --> 01:13:33,680
He can fold space and matter at will.

703
01:13:34,103 --> 01:13:39,040
He folds matter outside the mirror
dimension? In the real world? - Yeah.

704
01:13:39,565 --> 01:13:41,375
How many more?
- Two.

705
01:13:42,541 --> 01:13:47,066
I stranded one in the desert. - And the
other? - His body was in the hall.

706
01:13:47,067 --> 01:13:50,864
Master Drumm was in the foyer.
- He's been taken back to Kamar-Taj.

707
01:13:50,865 --> 01:13:52,564
The London Sanctum has fallen.

708
01:13:53,193 --> 01:13:57,378
Only New York and Hong Kong remain now
to shield us from the Dark Dimension.

709
01:13:58,355 --> 01:14:00,605
You defended the New York
Sanctum from attack.

710
01:14:00,979 --> 01:14:03,153
With its Master gone, it needs another,

711
01:14:03,188 --> 01:14:05,168
Master Strange.

712
01:14:07,644 --> 01:14:09,344
No.

713
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:11,717
It is Dr. Strange.

714
01:14:11,752 --> 01:14:14,056
Not Master Strange, not Mr. Strange,

715
01:14:14,057 --> 01:14:15,996
Doctor Strange.

716
01:14:17,256 --> 01:14:20,600
When I became a doctor,
I swore an oath to do no harm.

717
01:14:20,635 --> 01:14:23,701
And I have just killed a man!
I'm not doing that again.

718
01:14:23,736 --> 01:14:26,384
I became a doctor to save
lives, not take them.

719
01:14:26,419 --> 01:14:30,547
You become a doctor to save
one life above all others.

720
01:14:30,603 --> 01:14:32,376
Your own.

721
01:14:32,411 --> 01:14:36,178
Still seeing through me, are you?
- I see what I've always seen.

722
01:14:36,213 --> 01:14:38,367
Your overinflated ego.

723
01:14:38,924 --> 01:14:41,571
You want to go back to the delusion
that you can control anything,

724
01:14:42,151 --> 01:14:45,142
even death, which no one can control.

725
01:14:45,177 --> 01:14:47,865
Not even the great doctor
Stephen Strange.

726
01:14:48,281 --> 01:14:50,490
Not even Dormammu?

727
01:14:51,924 --> 01:14:53,624
He offers immortality.

728
01:14:53,889 --> 01:14:55,861
It's our fear of death
that gives Dormammu life.

729
01:14:55,896 --> 01:14:59,237
He feeds off it.
- Like you feed on him?

730
01:14:59,238 --> 01:15:02,729
You talk to me about controlling death.
Well, I know how you do it.

731
01:15:02,764 --> 01:15:05,749
I've seen the missing rituals
from the book of Cagliostro.

732
01:15:06,798 --> 01:15:09,970
Measure your next words
very carefully, doctor.

733
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:11,861
Because you might not like them?

734
01:15:11,896 --> 01:15:14,608
Because you may not know
of what you speak.

735
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:17,382
What is he talking about?
- I'm talking about her long life.

736
01:15:17,417 --> 01:15:19,392
The source of her immortality.

737
01:15:21,734 --> 01:15:24,548
She draws power from the
Dark Dimension to stay alive.

738
01:15:26,828 --> 01:15:30,306
That's not true. - I've seen the
rituals and worked them out.

739
01:15:31,222 --> 01:15:32,922
I know how you do it.

740
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:37,161
Once they regroup,
the zealots will be back.

741
01:15:38,268 --> 01:15:39,968
You'll need reinforcements.

742
01:15:47,478 --> 01:15:51,206
She is not who you think she is.
- You don't have the right to say that.

743
01:15:51,241 --> 01:15:53,522
You have no idea of the
responsibility that rests

744
01:15:53,534 --> 01:15:55,918
upon her shoulders.
- No, and I don't want to know.

745
01:15:56,282 --> 01:15:58,473
You're a coward.
- Because I'm not a killer?

746
01:15:58,485 --> 01:16:00,395
- These zealots will
snuff us all out,

747
01:16:00,673 --> 01:16:03,462
and you can muster the strength
to snuff them out first?

748
01:16:03,497 --> 01:16:06,447
What do you think I just did?
- You saved your own life!

749
01:16:07,353 --> 01:16:09,514
And then whined about
it like a wounded dog.

750
01:16:09,526 --> 01:16:11,504
- When you would have
done it so easily?

751
01:16:11,539 --> 01:16:14,519
You have no idea.
The things I've done...

752
01:16:16,203 --> 01:16:17,903
And the answer is yes.

753
01:16:18,433 --> 01:16:21,439
Without hesitation.
- Even if there's another way?

754
01:16:21,474 --> 01:16:24,900
There is no other way.
- You lack imagination.

755
01:16:24,901 --> 01:16:29,867
No, Stephen. You lack a spine.

756
01:16:34,945 --> 01:16:36,645
They're back.

757
01:16:42,956 --> 01:16:44,913
We have to end this. Now!

758
01:16:50,763 --> 01:16:53,379
Strange! Get down here and fight!

759
01:16:59,602 --> 01:17:01,302
The Mirror Dimension.

760
01:17:01,514 --> 01:17:03,707
You can't affect the
real world in here.

761
01:17:04,283 --> 01:17:07,138
Who's laughing now, asshole?

762
01:17:09,347 --> 01:17:11,046
I am.

763
01:17:23,915 --> 01:17:26,404
They've got no sling ring. I mean,
they can't escape, right?

764
01:17:27,789 --> 01:17:29,489
Run!

765
01:17:45,678 --> 01:17:47,520
Their connection to the
Dark Dimension makes

766
01:17:47,532 --> 01:17:49,345
them more powerful in
the Mirror Dimension.

767
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:52,339
They can't affect the real world,
but they can still kill us.

768
01:17:52,345 --> 01:17:54,650
This wasn't clever. This was suicide!

769
01:18:11,436 --> 01:18:13,136
That is hilarious.

770
01:18:59,767 --> 01:19:01,467
This was a mistake.

771
01:20:33,834 --> 01:20:35,533
It's true.

772
01:20:36,413 --> 01:20:38,874
She does draw power from
the Dark Dimension.

773
01:20:42,868 --> 01:20:44,672
Kaecilius.

774
01:20:46,773 --> 01:20:49,845
I came to you, broken,

775
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:52,230
lost, bleeding.

776
01:20:52,265 --> 01:20:55,836
I trusted you to be my teacher,
and you fed me lies.

777
01:20:55,871 --> 01:20:59,669
I tried to protect you.
- From the truth? - From yourself.

778
01:20:59,704 --> 01:21:04,192
I have a new teacher now.
- Dormammu deceives you.

779
01:21:04,906 --> 01:21:07,153
You have no idea of what he truly is.

780
01:21:07,188 --> 01:21:12,180
His eternal life is not
paradise, but torment. - Liar.

781
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:12,372
Christine!!!
- Are you kidding me?

782
01:22:13,495 --> 01:22:15,195
Oh my god.

783
01:22:16,807 --> 01:22:18,543
No fibrillation...

784
01:22:19,072 --> 01:22:20,772
It's neurogenic?
- Yes.

785
01:22:29,368 --> 01:22:31,068
Nick?

786
01:22:33,058 --> 01:22:34,946
We need to relieve the
pressure on her brain.

787
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:41,848
She still drops. - We're losing her!
- You need to increase her oxygen!

788
01:22:41,849 --> 01:22:44,910
I need a crash cart!
- Her pupils are dilated!

789
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:48,644
No reflexes.
I'm not reading any brain activity.

790
01:22:59,392 --> 01:23:01,091
What are you doing?

791
01:23:01,647 --> 01:23:03,347
You're dying!

792
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:14,896
You have to return to your body now.
You don't have time.

793
01:23:14,931 --> 01:23:18,884
Time is relative. Your body
hasn't even hit the floor yet.

794
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:24,123
I've spent so many years
peering through time,

795
01:23:24,626 --> 01:23:26,609
looking at this exact moment.

796
01:23:26,959 --> 01:23:28,909
But I can't see past it.

797
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:32,488
I've prevented countless terrible futures.

798
01:23:32,523 --> 01:23:35,064
And after each one, there's always another.

799
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:37,573
And they all lead here,

800
01:23:38,244 --> 01:23:41,016
but never further.
- You think this is where you die.

801
01:23:42,131 --> 01:23:45,514
Do you wonder what I see in your future?
- No.

802
01:23:47,768 --> 01:23:52,512
Yes. - I never saw your future.
Only its possibilities.

803
01:23:53,405 --> 01:23:56,487
You have such a capacity for goodness.

804
01:23:56,522 --> 01:23:58,445
You always excelled,

805
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,637
but not because you crave success,

806
01:24:00,672 --> 01:24:02,931
but because of your fear of failure.

807
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:05,393
It's what made me a great doctor.

808
01:24:05,428 --> 01:24:08,249
It's precisely what kept
you from greatness.

809
01:24:09,135 --> 01:24:11,423
Arrogance and fear still keep you

810
01:24:11,458 --> 01:24:14,522
from learning the simplest and
most significant lesson of all.

811
01:24:14,965 --> 01:24:16,665
Which is?

812
01:24:18,047 --> 01:24:19,747
It's not about you.

813
01:24:24,012 --> 01:24:25,737
When you first came to me,

814
01:24:25,772 --> 01:24:28,657
you asked me how I was able
to heal Jonathan Pangborn.

815
01:24:29,621 --> 01:24:31,321
I didn't.

816
01:24:32,823 --> 01:24:36,384
He channels dimensional energy
directly into his own body.

817
01:24:37,577 --> 01:24:40,126
He uses magic to walk.
- Constantly.

818
01:24:40,810 --> 01:24:42,510
He had a choice,

819
01:24:43,474 --> 01:24:45,244
to return to to his own life

820
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:48,102
or to serve something greater than himself.

821
01:24:48,137 --> 01:24:50,633
So, I could have my hands back again?

822
01:24:51,142 --> 01:24:52,842
My old life?

823
01:24:53,286 --> 01:24:54,986
You could.

824
01:24:55,644 --> 01:24:58,408
And the world would be
all the lesser for it.

825
01:24:59,897 --> 01:25:02,739
I've hated drawing power
from the Dark Dimension.

826
01:25:03,268 --> 01:25:06,671
But as you well know, sometimes one
must break the rules

827
01:25:06,706 --> 01:25:10,513
in order to serve the greater good.
- Mordo won't see it that way.

828
01:25:11,024 --> 01:25:13,673
Mordo's soul is rigid and unmovable,

829
01:25:13,708 --> 01:25:15,832
forged by the fires of his youth.

830
01:25:16,606 --> 01:25:19,735
He needs your flexibility,
just as you need his strength.

831
01:25:21,132 --> 01:25:24,840
Only together do you stand a
chance of stopping Dormammu.

832
01:25:25,236 --> 01:25:26,936
I'm not ready.

833
01:25:28,705 --> 01:25:30,405
No one ever is.

834
01:25:31,624 --> 01:25:34,352
We don't get to choose our time.

835
01:25:37,874 --> 01:25:39,848
Death is what gives life meaning.

836
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:43,588
To know your days are numbered,

837
01:25:44,219 --> 01:25:45,919
your time is short.

838
01:25:48,031 --> 01:25:50,878
You'd think after all
this time I'd be ready.

839
01:25:51,177 --> 01:25:52,960
But look at me,

840
01:25:52,961 --> 01:25:55,685
stretching one moment out into a thousand,

841
01:25:56,436 --> 01:25:58,416
just so I can watch the snow.

842
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:39,100
Are you okay?

843
01:26:46,672 --> 01:26:49,209
I don't understand what's happening.
- I know.

844
01:26:50,974 --> 01:26:53,434
But I have to go right now.

845
01:26:58,545 --> 01:27:01,034
You said that losing my hands
didn't have to be the end,

846
01:27:01,069 --> 01:27:03,850
that it could be a beginning.
- Yeah.

847
01:27:05,861 --> 01:27:08,354
Because there are other ways to save lives.

848
01:27:11,858 --> 01:27:13,558
A harder way.

849
01:27:15,811 --> 01:27:17,510
A weirder way.

850
01:27:17,667 --> 01:27:21,165
Dr. Palmer, the ER, please.
Dr. Palmer, the ER.

851
01:27:25,834 --> 01:27:27,534
I don't want to let you go.

852
01:28:15,745 --> 01:28:17,445
Stop.

853
01:28:21,958 --> 01:28:25,221
Hong Kong

854
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:48,340
Choose your weapon wisely.

855
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:53,635
No one steps foot in this Sanctum.

856
01:28:56,379 --> 01:28:58,079
No one.

857
01:29:13,391 --> 01:29:17,055
Kaecilius. - You're on the
wrong side of history, Wong.

858
01:29:29,855 --> 01:29:33,164
She's dead.
- You were right.

859
01:29:34,015 --> 01:29:36,435
She wasn't who I thought she was.

860
01:29:36,964 --> 01:29:38,664
She was complicated.

861
01:29:43,626 --> 01:29:45,326
Complicated?

862
01:29:48,168 --> 01:29:49,984
The Dark Dimension is volatile.

863
01:29:50,591 --> 01:29:52,291
Dangerous.

864
01:29:52,686 --> 01:29:54,386
What if it overtook her?

865
01:29:55,902 --> 01:29:57,942
She taught us it was forbidden,

866
01:29:59,043 --> 01:30:02,826
while she drew on its power
to steal centuries of life.

867
01:30:02,861 --> 01:30:05,003
She did what she thought was right.

868
01:30:05,016 --> 01:30:06,715
The bill comes due.

869
01:30:07,776 --> 01:30:09,476
Don't you see?

870
01:30:11,249 --> 01:30:13,733
Her transgressions led
the zealots to Dormammu.

871
01:30:13,768 --> 01:30:17,739
Kaecilius was her fault.

872
01:30:18,253 --> 01:30:21,385
And here we are, in the
consequence of her deception.

873
01:30:25,130 --> 01:30:28,561
A world on fire.
- Mordo, London Sanctum has fallen.

874
01:30:28,596 --> 01:30:32,474
And New York has been attacked. Twice.
You know where they're going next.

875
01:30:33,069 --> 01:30:36,696
Hong Kong. - You told me once to
fight as if my life depended on it,

876
01:30:36,702 --> 01:30:39,501
because one day, it might.
Well, today is that day.

877
01:30:40,104 --> 01:30:42,199
I can not defeat them alone.

878
01:31:00,132 --> 01:31:01,832
The Sanctum has already fallen.

879
01:31:09,737 --> 01:31:11,436
The Dark Dimension.

880
01:31:12,965 --> 01:31:14,665
Dormammu is coming.

881
01:31:16,804 --> 01:31:18,550
It's too late.

882
01:31:18,551 --> 01:31:20,251
Nothing can stop him.

883
01:31:22,190 --> 01:31:23,890
Not necessarily.

884
01:31:27,659 --> 01:31:29,359
No.

885
01:32:10,373 --> 01:32:12,073
Spells working.

886
01:32:13,187 --> 01:32:14,942
We got a second chance.

887
01:33:53,813 --> 01:33:56,128
No!

888
01:34:05,690 --> 01:34:07,520
Wong!

889
01:34:15,654 --> 01:34:17,354
I'm breaking the laws of nature, I know.

890
01:34:19,835 --> 01:34:21,534
Well, don't stop now.

891
01:34:22,893 --> 01:34:26,183
When the Sanctum is restored, they will
attack again. We have to defend it.

892
01:34:26,218 --> 01:34:28,601
Come on!

893
01:34:56,242 --> 01:34:59,405
Get up, Strange. Get up and fight!

894
01:34:59,455 --> 01:35:01,155
We will finish this.

895
01:35:02,047 --> 01:35:03,947
You can't fight the inevitable.

896
01:35:07,416 --> 01:35:09,116
Isn't it beautiful?

897
01:35:10,619 --> 01:35:12,673
A world beyond time.

898
01:35:15,643 --> 01:35:17,343
Beyond death.

899
01:35:21,153 --> 01:35:22,853
Beyond time...

900
01:35:23,110 --> 01:35:24,810
Strange!

901
01:35:56,515 --> 01:35:58,215
He's gone.

902
01:35:59,149 --> 01:36:02,072
Stephen Strange has left
to surrender to his power.

903
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:37,181
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

904
01:36:37,216 --> 01:36:40,034
You've come to die.

905
01:36:40,069 --> 01:36:47,068
Your world is now my
world, like all worlds.

906
01:37:17,204 --> 01:37:20,169
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

907
01:37:20,831 --> 01:37:23,221
You've come to die.

908
01:37:23,878 --> 01:37:27,195
Your world is now my world...

909
01:37:28,032 --> 01:37:29,732
What is this?

910
01:37:29,854 --> 01:37:34,119
Illusion? - No, this is real.
- Good.

911
01:37:44,580 --> 01:37:47,395
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

912
01:37:47,865 --> 01:37:50,709
You... what is happening?

913
01:37:51,425 --> 01:37:54,071
Just as you gave Kaecilius
powers from your dimension,

914
01:37:54,398 --> 01:37:56,519
I've brought a little power from mine.

915
01:37:57,178 --> 01:37:59,283
This is time.

916
01:37:59,849 --> 01:38:03,145
An endless looped time.

917
01:38:03,658 --> 01:38:06,209
You dare!

918
01:38:09,482 --> 01:38:11,250
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

919
01:38:12,516 --> 01:38:14,785
You cannot do this forever.

920
01:38:15,177 --> 01:38:16,876
Actually, I can.

921
01:38:16,998 --> 01:38:18,698
This is how things are now.

922
01:38:19,388 --> 01:38:23,550
You and me, trapped in
this moment, endlessly.

923
01:38:23,923 --> 01:38:27,139
Then you will spend eternity dying.

924
01:38:27,808 --> 01:38:31,371
Yeah. But everyone on Earth will live.

925
01:38:31,683 --> 01:38:33,383
But you will suffer.

926
01:38:33,572 --> 01:38:35,337
Pain is an old friend.

927
01:38:38,161 --> 01:38:39,861
Dormammu!

928
01:38:39,974 --> 01:38:42,597
I've come to bargain.
- End this!

929
01:38:42,740 --> 01:38:45,723
Dormammu!... Dormammu!...
Dormammu!...

930
01:39:01,159 --> 01:39:03,814
You will never win.

931
01:39:05,375 --> 01:39:07,074
No...

932
01:39:07,298 --> 01:39:08,998
But I can lose.

933
01:39:09,499 --> 01:39:16,436
Again, and again, and again,
and again, forever.

934
01:39:18,108 --> 01:39:20,991
And that makes you my prisoner.
- No.

935
01:39:21,026 --> 01:39:25,467
Stop! Make this stop!!!

936
01:39:26,016 --> 01:39:29,454
Set me free!
- No.

937
01:39:30,344 --> 01:39:32,106
I've come to bargain.

938
01:39:33,869 --> 01:39:36,665
Oh, what do you want?

939
01:39:37,903 --> 01:39:40,060
Take your zealots from the Earth.

940
01:39:40,621 --> 01:39:42,635
End your assault on my world.

941
01:39:43,170 --> 01:39:45,045
Never come back.

942
01:39:45,463 --> 01:39:48,542
Do it, and I'll break the loop.

943
01:39:58,251 --> 01:39:59,951
Get up, Strange.

944
01:39:59,969 --> 01:40:01,674
Get up and fight!

945
01:40:02,050 --> 01:40:03,799
We will finish this.

946
01:40:04,298 --> 01:40:05,997
Isn't it beautiful?

947
01:40:07,517 --> 01:40:09,564
A world beyond time.

948
01:40:12,328 --> 01:40:14,027
Beyond death.

949
01:40:25,987 --> 01:40:28,484
What have you done?
- I made a bargain.

950
01:40:32,230 --> 01:40:36,402
What is this? - Well, it's, uh...
it's everything you ever wanted.

951
01:40:37,728 --> 01:40:40,072
Eternal life as part of the One.

952
01:40:42,773 --> 01:40:44,733
You're not going to like it.

953
01:41:03,797 --> 01:41:06,710
I think he really should have
stolen the whole book,

954
01:41:06,711 --> 01:41:08,411
because the warnings...

955
01:41:08,824 --> 01:41:11,490
the warnings come after the spells.

956
01:41:20,745 --> 01:41:22,932
Oh, that's funny.

957
01:41:49,418 --> 01:41:51,118
We did it.

958
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:55,259
Yes.

959
01:41:55,479 --> 01:41:57,179
Yes, we did it.

960
01:41:58,200 --> 01:42:01,587
By also violating the natural laws.

961
01:42:02,398 --> 01:42:04,351
Look around you. It's over.

962
01:42:04,953 --> 01:42:07,790
You still think there will be
no consequences, Strange?

963
01:42:09,172 --> 01:42:10,928
No price to pay?

964
01:42:11,511 --> 01:42:14,533
We broke our rules, just like her.

965
01:42:15,445 --> 01:42:19,227
The bill comes due.

966
01:42:19,992 --> 01:42:21,692
Always.

967
01:42:21,921 --> 01:42:25,243
A reckoning.

968
01:42:26,368 --> 01:42:29,198
I will follow this path no longer.

969
01:43:03,109 --> 01:43:04,809
Yeah, it's okay.

970
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:15,539
Wise choice.

971
01:43:15,918 --> 01:43:19,844
You'll wear the eye of Agamotto
once you've mastered its powers.

972
01:43:20,404 --> 01:43:22,104
Until then,

973
01:43:22,479 --> 01:43:25,715
best not to walk the streets
wearing an infinity stone.

974
01:43:25,994 --> 01:43:29,871
A what? - You have a gift for the mystic
arts, but you still have much to learn.

975
01:43:33,104 --> 01:43:36,586
Word of the Ancient One's death
will spread through the multiverse.

976
01:43:37,008 --> 01:43:39,916
The Earth has no Sorcerer
Supreme to defend it.

977
01:43:40,227 --> 01:43:42,397
We must be ready.
- We'll be ready.

978
01:46:29,783 --> 01:46:33,480
So, Earth has wizards now, huh?

979
01:46:34,723 --> 01:46:38,032
Tea?
- I don't drink tea.

980
01:46:38,043 --> 01:46:39,743
What do you drink?

981
01:46:39,948 --> 01:46:42,141
Not tea.

982
01:46:45,146 --> 01:46:47,729
So, I keep a watchlist
of individuals and beings

983
01:46:47,730 --> 01:46:50,298
from other realms that may
be a threat to this world.

984
01:46:50,387 --> 01:46:53,893
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.

985
01:46:56,049 --> 01:46:58,914
A worthy inclusion.
- Yeah.

986
01:47:00,106 --> 01:47:03,948
So, why bring him here to New York?

987
01:47:03,978 --> 01:47:07,952
That's a long story.
A family drama, that kind of thing,

988
01:47:07,953 --> 01:47:10,185
but... we're looking for my father.

989
01:47:10,493 --> 01:47:16,867
Oh, okay. So, if you've found Odin,
you all will return to Asgard, probably?

990
01:47:16,911 --> 01:47:20,093
Oh, yes. Probably.
- Alright.

991
01:47:21,276 --> 01:47:22,976
Let me help you.

992
01:47:56,599 --> 01:47:57,599
Can I help you?

993
01:47:58,878 --> 01:48:01,643
They carried you into
Kamar-Taj on a strecher.

994
01:48:03,471 --> 01:48:04,531
Look at you now.

995
01:48:04,706 --> 01:48:07,851
- Pangborn.
- Mordo.

996
01:48:10,842 --> 01:48:12,498
So, what can I do for you? Man!

997
01:48:12,522 --> 01:48:16,215
You been away many months now
and I heard a revelation.

998
01:48:17,647 --> 01:48:22,625
The true purpose of a sorcerer is to
twist things out of there proper shape.

999
01:48:23,670 --> 01:48:29,556
Stealing power, providing nature...
like you.

1000
01:48:30,512 --> 01:48:34,249
I stolen nothing. This is my power. Mine.

1001
01:48:34,443 --> 01:48:37,853
Power... has a purpose.

1002
01:48:52,798 --> 01:48:53,989
Why you doing this?

1003
01:48:54,825 --> 01:48:57,825
Because I see it long last
was wrong with the world.

1004
01:49:03,137 --> 01:49:05,375
Too many sorcerers.
