1
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:05,431
Good God.

2
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:16,776
Matthew.

3
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:18,403
Matthew.

4
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:21,656
Matthew.

5
00:05:21,823 --> 00:05:26,661
<i>They say your whole life flashes
before your eyes when you die.</i>

6
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:31,416
<i>And it's true, even for a blind man.</i>

7
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:40,299
<i>I grew up in Hell's Kitchen.</i>

8
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:44,262
<i>The politicians and the real-estate
developers call it Clinton now.</i>

9
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:48,975
<i>But a neighborhood,
like everything else, has a soul.</i>

10
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,769
<i>And souls don't change with a name.</i>

11
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:54,605
Come on, shrimp, hit me.
I'll give you a free shot.

12
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:57,608
- Hit him again.
- You fight like your dad.

13
00:05:57,817 --> 00:05:58,818
Come on, hit me.

14
00:05:58,985 --> 00:06:01,195
- My dad's gonna be champ.
- Your dad's a bum.

15
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:03,906
- Yeah, a bum.
- Come on. Hit me.

16
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,827
- Yeah, he's a punk, man.
- Can't fight.

17
00:06:07,994 --> 00:06:10,830
- Sure can run, though.
- Pathetic.

18
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:13,833
<i>My father was a boxer.</i>

19
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,919
<i>A sportswriter once wrote
that he fought like the devil...</i>

20
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:18,921
<i>...and the name stuck.</i>

21
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:22,300
<i>Jack "The Devil" Murdock
was a contender.</i>

22
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,511
<i>But that was a long time ago.</i>

23
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:30,516
Come on, Dad. Get up.

24
00:06:36,272 --> 00:06:38,524
- Who won?
- Colan.

25
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:40,693
Yeah?

26
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,281
- I beat him, you know.
- I know, Dad. TKO.

27
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:48,284
That's right, Matty, you remember.

28
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:56,709
- Hey, hey, what's that?
- Nothing.

29
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,670
I told you I didn't want you fighting.

30
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:04,550
I tried to walk away, like you said,
but they kept giving me shit.

31
00:07:04,717 --> 00:07:06,677
Don't curse.

32
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:08,846
What kind of shit?

33
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:19,440
They said that you work for Fallon.
That you're one of his guys now.

34
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:24,195
Get over here. Sit down. Come on.

35
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:30,576
Think I'd be pulling double overtime at
the docks if I was working for Fallon?

36
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:33,162
What are you, nuts?

37
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:36,374
You don't hit nothing but books.
Get me?

38
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:41,337
You be a doctor or a lawyer.
Not like me.

39
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:47,510
- Dad...
- Matt, you can do it.

40
00:07:47,677 --> 00:07:50,680
You can do anything if you're not afraid.

41
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:53,432
Now, you promise me.

42
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:01,440
<i>I promise, Dad.</i>

43
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:40,438
Hey, guys, pull that line all the way in.

44
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:43,733
Then bring the crane around front,
all right?

45
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,903
Hey, kid. What, are you trying
to get yourself killed?

46
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:49,780
I'm looking for my dad, Jack Murdock.
Seen him around?

47
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:52,867
Murdock? No, he ain't worked here
in months.

48
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:56,495
- Now, beat it, huh?
- Come on, move it.

49
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:18,684
- Jack, I don't want you to hurt me.
- I will.

50
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:21,437
Jack, come on.
I had other obligations.

51
00:09:21,646 --> 00:09:24,440
- Dad?
- Okay, I got it.

52
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:27,193
Matt?

53
00:09:28,152 --> 00:09:30,988
Matt!

54
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:39,617
Matty, I...

55
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:45,456
- I talked to the doctor, and--
- I'm blind. I know.

56
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,291
How could you know?

57
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,126
I heard you talking in his office.

58
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,587
I hear everything.

59
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:54,465
Something's happened to me, Dad.

60
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:55,966
I don't know what it is.

61
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:05,976
I'm sorry, Matty.

62
00:12:07,103 --> 00:12:09,230
I'm so sorry.

63
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:46,434
<i>We made each other a silent promise...</i>

64
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,354
<i>...to never give up.</i>

65
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,149
<i>To be fearless.</i>

66
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,778
<i>To stick up for the long shots like us.</i>

67
00:13:00,406 --> 00:13:04,118
<i>We were two fighters
on the comeback trail.</i>

68
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:13,669
<i>I had lost my sight,
but I got something back in return.</i>

69
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:19,467
<i>My remaining four senses functioned
with superhuman sharpness.</i>

70
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,309
<i>But most amazing of all, my sense of
sound gave off a kind of radar sense.</i>

71
00:13:50,206 --> 00:13:55,044
<i>High above the roar of the streets,
I trained my body and my senses.</i>

72
00:13:56,212 --> 00:14:00,299
<i>An acute sense of touch
gave me both strength and balance...</i>

73
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:06,889
<i>...until the city itself
became my playground.</i>

74
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,396
<i>I was the boy without fear.</i>

75
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:24,990
Murdock!

76
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:38,504
Hey, Murdock! Round two.

77
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:46,095
- What's up, freak?
- Look at him, man. Look at his eyes.

78
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:49,723
- Kick his ass.
- Go ahead, fight me. I dare you.

79
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,393
- Yeah, Murdock.
- I dare you.

80
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,312
Yeah, that's what I'm saying, man.
Kick his ass.

81
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:58,816
Come on, man, let's just go.

82
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:03,195
Okay.

83
00:15:48,324 --> 00:15:50,117
Jack, it's been a while.

84
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:56,332
- I don't work for you no more, Fallon.
- Jack, you never stopped.

85
00:15:56,498 --> 00:16:00,419
Did you really think
you won those fights on your own?

86
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:06,425
You're 42 years old.
Miller, Mack, Bendis.

87
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:09,720
They're all my fighters.

88
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:11,555
Just like you.

89
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:15,768
And now it's your turn to take a fall.

90
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:20,356
<i>Think about your boy, Jack.</i>

91
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:24,401
<i>I'm sure you'll do the right thing.</i>

92
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,424
Matty.

93
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:41,979
No, come on, Dad! Come on, Dad,
get up! You can do it, Dad. Come on!

94
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:46,316
Come on, Dad. Get up! Come on!

95
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:53,490
Let's go! Come on! Come on, Dad!
Get up!

96
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:56,076
Never give up, remember?

97
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:00,998
Yeah, yeah! Come on, Dad. All right!
Yeah!

98
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:05,711
You all right? Murdock, you all right?
Okay, let's fight.

99
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:19,767
Down! He's out. Fight's over.

100
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:30,027
Ladies and gentlemen,
the winner, by way of knockout...

101
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:35,532
...Jack "The Devil" Murdock!

102
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:48,879
This one was for you, Matty.

103
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:53,801
<i>I waited outside of the Olympic
for my father.</i>

104
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:57,012
<i>In some ways, I'm still waiting.</i>

105
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,824
Finish him off.

106
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,577
Dad!

107
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:13,964
I can't see you, Dad.

108
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:18,093
I can't see you.

109
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:44,912
<i>No one cared much about the death
of a washed-up prizefighter.</i>

110
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:49,333
<i>Nobody but me.
I would keep my promise.</i>

111
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:52,127
<i>I would help those that others wouldn't.</i>

112
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:54,838
<i>I would seek justice.</i>

113
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:58,967
<i>One way or another.</i>

114
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:53,957
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are here today to seek truth.

115
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:56,209
To seek justice.

116
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:01,256
Mr. Quesada,
would you state for the court...

117
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:04,760
...the sequence of events leading up
to the night of June 30?

118
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:10,140
I stopped off at Josie's Bar after work.
I had a few drinks.

119
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,144
Angela was there.
She was closing up.

120
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:19,858
She asked me if I wanted
to stick around for some fun.

121
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:25,822
Anything that happened after that
was entirely consensual.

122
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:33,830
Are you aware that perjury is a crime,
Mr. Quesada?

123
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:36,792
Objection. My client's a respectable
member of the community.

124
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:40,087
- Miss Sutton has a history of drug--
- My client's not on trial.

125
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:42,798
- Her testimony is suspect--
- Nor is her testimony suspect.

126
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:44,299
Gentlemen, that's enough.

127
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:49,638
The truth is, Mr. Murdock,
is that Miss Sutton...

128
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:53,809
Miss Sutton enjoyed every minute of it.

129
00:23:56,603 --> 00:24:03,026
Mr. Quesada, for your sake,
I hope justice is found here today...

130
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,406
...before justice finds you.

131
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:13,537
Matt? Matt, where you going?

132
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:16,039
We knew this was a risk going in.

133
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:19,417
Why? She's from the Kitchen?
She's not from the Upper East Side?

134
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:22,379
Yeah. Come on, man,
she has a history of drug abuse.

135
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:23,839
That was a long time ago.

136
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:27,843
I know, but juries don't like their victims
to be flawed. You know that.

137
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:31,847
- It's not right.
- Yeah?

138
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:33,223
Here's what I don't get.

139
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,560
How can a scumbag like Quesada
afford an attorney like Hirsh?

140
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:40,605
He can't.
The Kingpin's gotta be footing the bill.

141
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:44,734
- Come on, let's go get drunk.
- Not tonight.

142
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:47,404
I got work to do.

143
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:07,651
Line them up, Josie.
I'm ready to party tonight.

144
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:10,487
Got a lot of nerve coming in here
after what you did.

145
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:13,156
Didn't you hear? I'm innocent, baby.

146
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:21,957
Bikes behind the cage!

147
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:25,835
No burnout, you assholes!

148
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:52,362
- Right here.
- Hey.

149
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:55,532
- What's up?
- You gotta take that.

150
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:57,450
- Big neck, come on.
- I can't believe--

151
00:26:57,617 --> 00:26:59,703
What was her name?

152
00:26:59,869 --> 00:27:02,956
To the justice system, right?
Of course I beat it.

153
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:06,376
Kingpin's got my back, bro.
How you doing, sweetie?

154
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:08,086
- Boss?
- What's up?

155
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:12,966
- What's up with that?
- Is that guy for real?

156
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,428
Yeah, he's for real.

157
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:19,264
- What do you want?
- Justice.

158
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:35,692
Quesada!

159
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:39,487
Time to give the devil his due.

160
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:58,840
Oh, God. Oh, God!

161
00:31:02,153 --> 00:31:07,158
- Hey. How you doing?
- Didn't you hear?

162
00:31:07,325 --> 00:31:09,869
- I was acquitted.
- Not by me.

163
00:31:12,747 --> 00:31:16,251
Who made you judge?

164
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:19,921
You did.

165
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:35,270
Go to hell...

166
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:36,729
<i>...diablo.</i>

167
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:41,317
Okay. But you'll beat me there.

168
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:56,082
Hey, that light
at the end of the tunnel?

169
00:31:56,332 --> 00:32:00,878
- Guess what. That's not heaven.
- I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

170
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:04,549
- That's the C train.
- I'll kill you! Oh, God!

171
00:32:14,183 --> 00:32:16,227
Hey, you can't go past there.

172
00:32:16,394 --> 00:32:18,605
- Call Charlie.
- Right.

173
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:22,483
You're wasting your time, Urich.
There's nothing to see here.

174
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:25,278
Jose Quesada.

175
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:30,199
And the rest of Jose Quesada.

176
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:34,287
- Whole lot of nothing, huh?
- Keep running those stories...

177
00:32:34,454 --> 00:32:38,166
...and we'll end up with copycat
vigilantes who'll get themselves killed.

178
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:42,462
Are you here to confirm that Daredevil
is responsible for this, detective?

179
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:45,048
Come on, Urich. Stop busting my--

180
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,219
There is no proof that your
so-called Daredevil was involved...

181
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:54,140
...nor that he even exists. Got it?

182
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:09,155
Got it.

183
00:33:28,424 --> 00:33:31,010
<i>Can one man make a difference?</i>

184
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:37,225
<i>There are days when I believe.
And others when I have lost all faith.</i>

185
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:14,554
<i>Matt, it's Heather. Are you there?
Of course you're not there.</i>

186
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:18,641
<i>You're never there.
At least, not for me.</i>

187
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:21,894
<i>Look, I didn't wanna do this
over the phone...</i>

188
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:24,313
<i>...but it's not like you've given me
any choice.</i>

189
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:29,402
<i>I mean, it's been three months now,
and I've never even seen your apartment.</i>

190
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:32,780
<i>Every time we sleep together,
I wake up in the morning alone.</i>

191
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:36,993
<i>I mean, Jesus, where do you go
at 3:00 in the morning?</i>

192
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:42,999
<i>I thought that if I waited,
if I was patient enough, you'd let me in.</i>

193
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:46,961
<i>That we'd take our relationship
to the next level.</i>

194
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:51,090
<i>Then I realized
that this is the next level.</i>

195
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:55,887
<i>Goodbye, Matt.
I hope you find what you're looking for.</i>

196
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,629
<i>Please don't hurt me!</i>

197
00:36:11,796 --> 00:36:16,425
<i>Please don't shoot!
I didn't do anything wrong!</i>

198
00:37:15,526 --> 00:37:17,528
Sleep now.

199
00:37:41,177 --> 00:37:43,346
"Eyewitnesses say Quesada
was singled out...

200
00:37:43,554 --> 00:37:47,433
...by the demonic vigilante
known as the Daredevil."

201
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,771
- I don't know why you read that trash.
- There's gotta be something to it.

202
00:37:51,979 --> 00:37:55,358
- Like the alligators in the sewers?
- There are alligators in the sewers.

203
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:59,195
- A friend in sanitation has seen them.
- Fine. Just drop it.

204
00:37:59,612 --> 00:38:01,864
You should see this guy.
They got this picture.

205
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:05,326
- They have a picture?
- It's a drawing, an artist's rendering.

206
00:38:06,202 --> 00:38:09,205
It's just-- It's grotesque.

207
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:12,208
I'd hate to see his therapy bills.
Speaking of bills...

208
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:14,627
...your client, Mr. Lee,
made his first payment.

209
00:38:14,794 --> 00:38:19,715
- Great. You should be very happy.
- Yeah, it's fantastic. He paid in fluke.

210
00:38:20,049 --> 00:38:22,802
Fluke is a fish, Matt.
Did you know that? I didn't.

211
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:25,721
Mr. Lee is a good man
and doesn't have much money...

212
00:38:25,888 --> 00:38:28,391
...and he fishes on weekends.
I guess it's--

213
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:32,687
I salsa dance on weekends, but I don't
shake my ass to pay my phone bill.

214
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:34,730
Will you pass the honey, please?

215
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:38,401
We need better clients.
I'm tired of pro Bono cases.

216
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:42,238
What is your problem with our clients?
We have good, honorable clients.

217
00:38:42,405 --> 00:38:44,740
What's your idea of better?
Define "better."

218
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:51,330
- What would be a better client?
- Better means rich and guilty, okay?

219
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:53,916
Law school taught us
to create a moral vacuum...

220
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:56,711
...so you can represent people
who aren't innocent.

221
00:38:56,919 --> 00:39:00,881
- That was your best course, as I recall.
- You don't have a moral vacuum.

222
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,050
You are completely vacuum-less.

223
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,387
- What happened to your face?
- Nothing.

224
00:39:06,554 --> 00:39:08,556
It's a small cut. I walked into a door.

225
00:39:08,723 --> 00:39:13,602
Matt, every time you disappear, we can't
get ahold of you, you come in all cut up.

226
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:16,689
I'm in the Fight Club.
It's the first rule of Fight Club.

227
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:20,192
Don't talk about Fight Club.
So you're not in the Fight Club.

228
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:21,861
Didn't see the movie.

229
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:24,697
I'm sure it's a funny joke,
but I didn't see it.

230
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:28,075
Okay? All I'm saying is
I'm here for you as a friend.

231
00:39:28,242 --> 00:39:31,245
I mean, I spent $3000
on that Seeing Eye dog.

232
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:33,372
I didn't ask for it.
I didn't want it.

233
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:36,792
Can I tell you something else?
Seeing Eye dogs bond for life.

234
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:41,005
Yours ran away. What does that tell you
about how emotionally available you are?

235
00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:51,515
- What? What? Where? Where? Where?
- Front door. Not yet, soon.

236
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:56,479
Now.

237
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:06,906
Tell me.

238
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:10,910
- You want the truth?
- Absolutely.

239
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:12,495
She's hideous.

240
00:40:13,621 --> 00:40:17,166
I don't know if it's a fungus
or some congenital birth defect...

241
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:22,671
...but as your attorney in this matter,
I advise you to take no further action.

242
00:40:28,427 --> 00:40:31,597
- I'm sorry. Excuse me.
- Sure.

243
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:36,268
I was looking for some honey.
Could you help me out?

244
00:40:37,311 --> 00:40:39,313
Right in front of you.

245
00:40:40,022 --> 00:40:43,275
Well, could you be
a little bit more specific?

246
00:40:43,526 --> 00:40:46,612
- What, are you--?
- Blind? Yeah.

247
00:40:47,238 --> 00:40:50,199
- I am so sorry.
- That's okay.

248
00:40:54,245 --> 00:40:57,790
- Friend of yours?
- You know, I've never seen him before.

249
00:41:00,084 --> 00:41:02,169
Matt Murdock.

250
00:41:02,336 --> 00:41:07,383
- Nice to meet you, Matt Murdock.
- Nice to meet you.

251
00:41:11,762 --> 00:41:14,306
I didn't get your name.

252
00:41:15,141 --> 00:41:16,767
I didn't give it.

253
00:41:22,523 --> 00:41:25,109
Some people have no compassion
for the handicapped.

254
00:41:25,985 --> 00:41:28,571
Apparently not.

255
00:41:29,822 --> 00:41:32,408
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna file an appeal.

256
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:34,451
We have to be in court by noon.

257
00:41:34,743 --> 00:41:37,496
- 12:00, Matt.
- I'll be there.

258
00:41:47,965 --> 00:41:49,383
What do you want?

259
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:53,012
I just wanted to get your name.
I didn't want trouble.

260
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:55,222
Look...

261
00:41:55,848 --> 00:41:59,435
...I don't like being followed. So don't.

262
00:42:00,394 --> 00:42:04,648
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a second. Take it easy.

263
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:07,651
I don't like being touched.

264
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:12,114
Why don't you tell me what you do like
and we'll start there?

265
00:42:30,049 --> 00:42:31,800
Sure you're blind?

266
00:42:32,009 --> 00:42:34,720
Sure you don't wanna
tell me your name?

267
00:43:02,164 --> 00:43:04,083
- You're holding back.
- Yes.

268
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,293
Don't.

269
00:43:09,672 --> 00:43:12,967
Does every guy have to go through this
to find out your name?

270
00:43:13,217 --> 00:43:15,344
You should try asking for my number.

271
00:43:18,305 --> 00:43:19,807
- Fight!
- Fight! Fight! Fight!

272
00:43:38,325 --> 00:43:41,078
Stop hitting me.

273
00:43:41,245 --> 00:43:42,496
Okay.

274
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:52,423
My name's Elektra Natchios.

275
00:43:53,924 --> 00:43:56,218
Thanks. That's all I wanted to know.

276
00:44:03,976 --> 00:44:05,227
I have to go.

277
00:44:05,394 --> 00:44:07,813
Go? Wait a second. Hold on.

278
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,065
I don't wanna get my ass kicked again.

279
00:44:10,232 --> 00:44:12,526
I just wanna know why you have to go.

280
00:44:15,237 --> 00:44:16,697
My bodyguard is here.

281
00:44:18,073 --> 00:44:19,533
Your bodyguard?

282
00:44:20,242 --> 00:44:23,412
If you need a bodyguard,
I'm in serious trouble.

283
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:25,748
I thought I lost him at the coffee shop.

284
00:44:25,914 --> 00:44:28,208
Dad can be a little overprotective.

285
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:32,421
Oh, Natchios. Right.
As in Nikolaos Natchios.

286
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:34,173
That's Dad.

287
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:43,265
How am I gonna find you?

288
00:44:45,351 --> 00:44:47,269
You won't.

289
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,692
I'll find you.

290
00:45:43,325 --> 00:45:47,162
- What's wrong, Wesley?
- Have you seen the papers today?

291
00:45:47,329 --> 00:45:49,998
Somebody's been talking.

292
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:53,210
Somebody always does.

293
00:45:56,338 --> 00:45:59,425
Wesley, did you know,
back in ancient times...

294
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:02,469
...they would cut the tongues
out of their bodyguards...

295
00:46:02,636 --> 00:46:05,681
...their first day on the job?

296
00:46:07,182 --> 00:46:09,351
You think that's horrible, don't you?

297
00:46:09,518 --> 00:46:11,854
Because you don't like the physical stuff.

298
00:46:14,356 --> 00:46:16,024
I do.

299
00:46:34,543 --> 00:46:36,628
Wesley, handkerchief.

300
00:46:44,344 --> 00:46:47,014
Your 11:00 is here.

301
00:46:48,182 --> 00:46:52,227
Natchios, my dear old friend.

302
00:47:01,778 --> 00:47:04,573
I'm getting out, Wilson.

303
00:47:05,032 --> 00:47:07,409
I am out.

304
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:14,208
You think it's funny?
They're writing about the Kingpin.

305
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:16,502
They're going back to the beginning.

306
00:47:16,668 --> 00:47:20,005
Well, I'm tired of looking
over my shoulder.

307
00:47:20,672 --> 00:47:24,259
I wanna put all that behind me now.
I want you to buy me out.

308
00:47:24,426 --> 00:47:28,305
I think you'll find
it's a very generous offer.

309
00:47:29,932 --> 00:47:32,100
So, what do you say?

310
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:48,200
How's your daughter?

311
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:57,960
- I said I was sorry. What do you want?
- Details. You owe me that.

312
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:01,547
Her name's Elektra Natchios.

313
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:04,132
She sounds like a Mexican appetizer.

314
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:06,260
It's Greek, genius.

315
00:48:06,426 --> 00:48:09,137
Her father's Nikolaos Natchios.

316
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:13,433
- The billionaire?
- Yeah, see. Yes, the billionaire.

317
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,645
As your attorney, I advise you
to marry her immediately.

318
00:48:16,812 --> 00:48:18,522
I'll take it under consideration.

319
00:48:18,689 --> 00:48:22,526
- What do we got?
- Oh, this one's a real winner.

320
00:48:22,693 --> 00:48:24,528
Dante Jackson, ex-con from Queens...

321
00:48:24,695 --> 00:48:26,989
...charged with the murder
of Lisa Tazio...

322
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:30,659
...your friendly neighborhood prostitute.
Bad news is Jackson was found...

323
00:48:30,826 --> 00:48:33,495
...passed out in an alley
holding the murder weapon...

324
00:48:33,662 --> 00:48:37,499
...and enough THC in his lungs
to get Staten Island high.

325
00:48:37,666 --> 00:48:40,168
Jackson can't remember what
happened that night...

326
00:48:40,335 --> 00:48:42,337
...or for that matter, most of the '90s.

327
00:48:42,504 --> 00:48:45,048
- What's the good news?
- The fluke wasn't bad.

328
00:48:45,215 --> 00:48:46,675
Can you let us in, please?

329
00:48:53,056 --> 00:48:54,850
Mr. Jackson.

330
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,895
Who are you?

331
00:48:59,354 --> 00:49:01,273
We're your attorneys...

332
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,360
...if you're innocent.
So are you?

333
00:49:06,111 --> 00:49:07,362
Innocent?

334
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:09,615
Yeah.

335
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,952
Hell, yeah.

336
00:49:18,624 --> 00:49:20,208
I believe you.

337
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:22,461
You do?

338
00:49:22,628 --> 00:49:23,879
You do?

339
00:49:24,046 --> 00:49:25,505
You got yourself a defense.

340
00:49:27,966 --> 00:49:29,885
Thank you.

341
00:49:30,218 --> 00:49:32,054
Thank you, sir.

342
00:49:34,473 --> 00:49:36,475
I want you to create a paper trail.

343
00:49:36,642 --> 00:49:38,644
One that can be traced to Natchios.

344
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:42,314
- Sir?
- The press want a Kingpin...

345
00:49:42,481 --> 00:49:46,360
...so I'll give them a Kingpin.
Get me Bullseye.

346
00:50:23,355 --> 00:50:25,357
Two out of three.

347
00:50:39,955 --> 00:50:42,708
Bloody Irish piece of trash.

348
00:51:34,259 --> 00:51:37,012
What do you think Jackson's
gonna pay us with? Chronic?

349
00:51:37,179 --> 00:51:40,974
The guy's a three-time loser, he was
a block away with the murder weapon.

350
00:51:41,141 --> 00:51:43,560
It makes the fact
that he's innocent interesting.

351
00:51:43,727 --> 00:51:45,854
- How are you sure?
- Have I ever been wrong?

352
00:51:46,021 --> 00:51:48,148
No, which is really starting to annoy me.

353
00:51:48,315 --> 00:51:50,442
Hey, come on, I got a blind guy here.

354
00:51:50,609 --> 00:51:52,611
Well, use the crosswalk, asshole.

355
00:51:53,612 --> 00:51:55,697
I love this city.

356
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:14,007
Empty your pockets.

357
00:52:28,355 --> 00:52:30,023
Raise your arms.

358
00:53:14,985 --> 00:53:19,072
All right, so this is it. Okay, now what?

359
00:53:19,239 --> 00:53:21,324
Take a look around.

360
00:53:21,491 --> 00:53:24,578
Look, Matt, I know you got
this built-in bullshit detector...

361
00:53:24,744 --> 00:53:27,414
...but this time it's on the blink.
Let's just say...

362
00:53:27,581 --> 00:53:29,332
- ...Jackson is innocent.
- He is.

363
00:53:29,499 --> 00:53:32,127
Why go through the trouble
of setting him up?

364
00:53:32,294 --> 00:53:34,838
Why the big cover-up in the death
of a prostitute?

365
00:53:35,005 --> 00:53:37,257
I don't know. I can't answer that.

366
00:53:37,424 --> 00:53:40,427
I gotta find out more about Lisa Tazio.

367
00:53:41,011 --> 00:53:44,347
Well, you know,
too bad we don't have a key.

368
00:53:46,182 --> 00:53:49,144
Matt? Matt, where you going?

369
00:53:51,688 --> 00:53:53,607
Give me your pen.

370
00:53:53,773 --> 00:53:55,400
To leave a note?

371
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:59,654
- Here.
- That was my pen.

372
00:54:13,001 --> 00:54:17,505
Must have been sick the day they
taught that. Is that real estate law?

373
00:54:20,342 --> 00:54:22,218
- What do you see?
- What do I see?

374
00:54:22,385 --> 00:54:26,556
I see high ceilings.
I see hardwood floors under carpet.

375
00:54:26,723 --> 00:54:28,391
I see some good Feng Shui.

376
00:54:28,558 --> 00:54:30,727
Think they rented this place yet?

377
00:55:23,989 --> 00:55:25,699
What, she have a puppy?

378
00:55:26,574 --> 00:55:29,327
- Ammonia.
- So what?

379
00:55:29,494 --> 00:55:32,247
Over blood.

380
00:55:32,414 --> 00:55:34,332
Something else.

381
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,835
Cordite.

382
00:55:37,002 --> 00:55:38,253
Gunpowder.

383
00:55:41,006 --> 00:55:46,177
She was shot here and dragged outside
to make it look like a random robbery.

384
00:55:54,602 --> 00:55:57,605
Come on, Matt, there's nothing
over there. Let's go.

385
00:55:59,524 --> 00:56:01,276
Write this down.

386
00:56:02,277 --> 00:56:05,947
She wrote something here in a
ballpoint pen. The imprint is in the wood.

387
00:56:06,114 --> 00:56:07,365
- M.
- M.

388
00:56:07,532 --> 00:56:08,783
- O.
- O.

389
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:10,410
- M.
- M.

390
00:56:10,577 --> 00:56:11,911
- Six.
- Six.

391
00:56:12,078 --> 00:56:13,455
- Eight.
- Eight.

392
00:56:14,205 --> 00:56:15,790
I knew it. Her mother did it.

393
00:56:15,957 --> 00:56:19,127
Now, can we please go
before we need attorneys too?

394
00:56:19,878 --> 00:56:22,964
Susie is my son Larry's daughter
by his first marriage.

395
00:56:23,131 --> 00:56:27,802
She eloped with this
semi-colored fella from London.

396
00:56:27,969 --> 00:56:29,929
What's the word for that? Mulatto.

397
00:56:30,096 --> 00:56:32,974
Just let's say he had
a little cream in his coffee.

398
00:56:33,141 --> 00:56:36,394
But he did very well
for himself on the Internet.

399
00:56:36,561 --> 00:56:38,480
But don't ask me how. No.

400
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:42,484
You know, they did get me a computer
for Christmas last year...

401
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:46,112
...but I refuse. I'm afraid
it's going to explode.

402
00:56:46,279 --> 00:56:48,531
But who can afford to fly these days?

403
00:56:48,698 --> 00:56:54,579
But then my sister Marjorie called and
said she had these frequent-flier miles...

404
00:56:54,746 --> 00:56:58,166
...and she couldn't use them
because of her sciatic nerve.

405
00:56:58,333 --> 00:56:59,793
So I said--

406
00:57:17,185 --> 00:57:20,105
She's sleeping. Can I get you
anything before we land?

407
00:57:20,855 --> 00:57:23,024
More peanuts, please.

408
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:27,362
<i>I'm here at the Manhattan Courthouse
where accused killer Dante Jackson...</i>

409
00:57:27,529 --> 00:57:29,656
<i>--accused of gunning down prostitute...</i>

410
00:57:29,823 --> 00:57:33,284
<i>- As you can see...
- Dante Jackson.</i>

411
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:35,870
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

412
00:57:36,037 --> 00:57:39,958
...I am not here to convince you
that Dante Jackson is a model citizen.

413
00:57:40,834 --> 00:57:44,838
He has been in and out of prisons and
reform schools since 12 years of age.

414
00:57:45,004 --> 00:57:48,007
But this is not a court of character,
however.

415
00:57:48,174 --> 00:57:49,801
This is a court of law.

416
00:57:50,218 --> 00:57:51,886
Isn't he facing the wrong way?

417
00:57:52,053 --> 00:57:55,515
Don't worry. He's got them
right where he wants them.

418
00:57:55,682 --> 00:57:57,225
Yeah.

419
00:57:58,351 --> 00:58:01,980
And that is what it's been like
for Mr. Jackson.

420
00:58:02,939 --> 00:58:04,816
Like trying to talk to a wall.

421
00:58:04,983 --> 00:58:08,820
Does this defense come with
a two-drink minimum, Mr. Murdock?

422
00:58:08,987 --> 00:58:12,365
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
I'm just trying to make a point.

423
00:58:12,532 --> 00:58:17,871
You see, justice is blind,
but it can be heard.

424
00:58:18,037 --> 00:58:22,333
And today, the truth will come out.
Thank you.

425
00:58:23,793 --> 00:58:25,795
Here, right this way.

426
00:58:25,962 --> 00:58:29,549
He's blind. He can't see anything.

427
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,553
Okay, here's the arm.
You got the arm there, Matt.

428
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,097
Just reach down. There you go.

429
00:58:36,723 --> 00:58:38,474
I'm sorry.

430
00:58:40,393 --> 00:58:44,647
Here we go. Right there.
You got it? Okay.

431
00:58:45,899 --> 00:58:48,735
- What, you think too much?
- Yeah, it was a little much.

432
00:58:48,902 --> 00:58:52,071
You always wanna do the chair thing,
and that's embarrassing.

433
00:58:52,238 --> 00:58:54,741
People want sympathy.
It's not <i>The Gong Show.</i>

434
00:58:55,408 --> 00:58:59,037
Officer Mackenzie, you were
the arriving officer at the scene, right?

435
00:58:59,204 --> 00:59:00,455
That's correct.

436
00:59:00,622 --> 00:59:03,124
Please, tell us what you observed.

437
00:59:03,958 --> 00:59:08,296
I was a block away when I got the call
of shots being fired.

438
00:59:08,463 --> 00:59:11,299
When I arrived on the scene,
Lisa Tazio's body...

439
00:59:11,466 --> 00:59:14,844
...was lying dead on the steps
of her apartment.

440
00:59:15,345 --> 00:59:18,806
I found Jackson passed out in the alley...

441
00:59:18,973 --> 00:59:21,017
...still holding the murder weapon...

442
00:59:21,184 --> 00:59:24,020
- What's wrong?
- ...Tazio's wallet in his pocket.

443
00:59:24,187 --> 00:59:26,189
Mackenzie's telling the truth.

444
00:59:26,356 --> 00:59:28,691
Yeah, that happens sometimes in court.

445
00:59:28,858 --> 00:59:32,278
No, no, no. Somebody has to be lying.

446
00:59:36,324 --> 00:59:37,867
What's he doing here?

447
00:59:38,034 --> 00:59:39,535
Who?

448
00:59:39,702 --> 00:59:41,287
It's Ben Urich.

449
00:59:41,454 --> 00:59:44,165
He's the reporter from the <i>Post.</i>

450
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:56,552
So does this mean you want a rematch?

451
00:59:57,512 --> 00:59:59,681
I told you I'd find you.

452
01:00:01,557 --> 01:00:04,852
How did you know I wasn't a mugger?

453
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:11,276
Muggers don't usually wear
rose oil or high heels.

454
01:00:11,442 --> 01:00:13,611
At least, this far from Chelsea.

455
01:00:15,697 --> 01:00:17,865
Come here.

456
01:00:18,574 --> 01:00:20,660
There's something I wanna show you.

457
01:00:21,077 --> 01:00:22,370
Wait a second.

458
01:00:22,578 --> 01:00:26,165
Exactly how many women
have you brought up here, anyway?

459
01:00:27,208 --> 01:00:29,002
You're my first.

460
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:32,964
- Good answer.
- I thought that was the right answer.

461
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:37,719
Look at this.

462
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:40,138
It's so beautiful.

463
01:00:40,388 --> 01:00:44,392
I know. This was my favorite view
of the city when I was a kid.

464
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:46,894
I really wanted you to see this.

465
01:01:02,201 --> 01:01:03,995
What's this?

466
01:01:05,496 --> 01:01:07,832
Oh, that's from my mother.

467
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:12,253
- For good luck.
- It's beautiful.

468
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:14,672
It's a good-luck charm, huh?

469
01:01:14,839 --> 01:01:18,426
I could use one of those.
Do they make them in Braille?

470
01:01:20,928 --> 01:01:25,266
She gave it to me right before she died.

471
01:01:26,017 --> 01:01:27,602
What happened?

472
01:01:28,603 --> 01:01:30,938
She was killed.

473
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:35,401
Right in front of me. I was 5.

474
01:01:37,362 --> 01:01:38,863
I'm sorry.

475
01:01:41,282 --> 01:01:43,785
No Greek tragedies, okay?

476
01:01:43,951 --> 01:01:45,620
Okay.

477
01:01:47,997 --> 01:01:50,458
- I should go.
- No. Just wait.

478
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:53,961
- No, I'm gonna go--
- Wait, wait, wait. It's about to rain.

479
01:01:54,128 --> 01:01:57,298
- No, it's not.
- It is. I'm telling you, it's--

480
01:01:57,465 --> 01:02:01,803
The temperature dropped two or
three degrees. I can smell the moisture.

481
01:02:01,969 --> 01:02:07,141
And when it rains, it's like
there's a rooftop on the world.

482
01:02:07,809 --> 01:02:12,313
Each raindrop makes a sound
the first time it falls on a surface.

483
01:02:13,147 --> 01:02:16,150
Just then, it's like I...

484
01:02:16,317 --> 01:02:18,528
It's like I can see again.

485
01:02:19,821 --> 01:02:22,740
And I just wanna...

486
01:02:24,075 --> 01:02:26,160
I just wanna see you.

487
01:02:30,164 --> 01:02:32,458
Okay.

488
01:02:33,042 --> 01:02:34,961
Look, here it comes.

489
01:03:02,363 --> 01:03:04,782
My God.

490
01:03:06,868 --> 01:03:09,704
You are so beautiful.

491
01:03:36,689 --> 01:03:38,691
Remember me?

492
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:43,362
Maybe you remember the Kingpin.

493
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:46,073
- You remember me now?
- What?

494
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,869
- Matt, what's wrong?
- What are you, stupid?

495
01:03:50,036 --> 01:03:53,039
You think you can hold out
on the Kingpin, huh?

496
01:03:56,375 --> 01:03:58,044
Matt.

497
01:03:59,545 --> 01:04:02,924
I have to go. I'm sorry.

498
01:04:06,052 --> 01:04:07,762
I have to go.

499
01:04:07,929 --> 01:04:11,766
Matt. Matt.

500
01:04:20,441 --> 01:04:23,653
No, no, no. No, no, please.

501
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,865
You remember me now?

502
01:04:28,032 --> 01:04:32,578
What are you, stupid? You think you
can hold out on the Kingpin, huh?

503
01:04:52,181 --> 01:04:53,766
Get away from me!

504
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:21,669
Stay out of Hell's Kitchen.

505
01:05:22,336 --> 01:05:25,339
This ain't your neighborhood no more.

506
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:28,676
Kitchen belongs to the Kingpin now.

507
01:05:48,738 --> 01:05:50,656
Please.

508
01:05:51,032 --> 01:05:53,367
Please don't hurt me.

509
01:05:53,701 --> 01:05:56,245
I'm not the bad guy, kid.

510
01:06:10,635 --> 01:06:13,137
I'm not the bad guy.

511
01:06:17,558 --> 01:06:19,560
I'm not.

512
01:06:38,913 --> 01:06:41,666
You know the great strength
of the Church?

513
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,586
Its sense of community.

514
01:06:45,753 --> 01:06:48,089
- Good morning, Father.
- Good morning.

515
01:06:48,923 --> 01:06:52,760
Now, this may come as a bit
of a surprise to you, Matthew...

516
01:06:53,344 --> 01:06:55,846
...but we are open on Sundays.

517
01:06:58,933 --> 01:07:00,393
I like the quiet.

518
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:03,562
I don't think so, son.
I think you like the solitude.

519
01:07:06,941 --> 01:07:10,027
And you find it in here,
do you, Matthew?

520
01:07:11,612 --> 01:07:13,698
Sometimes.

521
01:07:31,799 --> 01:07:33,968
Sometimes not.

522
01:07:34,635 --> 01:07:37,722
You don't have to go it alone, Matthew.

523
01:07:38,222 --> 01:07:40,725
My confessional is open to you
all the time.

524
01:07:41,475 --> 01:07:44,395
There's no keeping secrets
from God, son.

525
01:07:45,813 --> 01:07:50,818
Spend 30 years in one of them little
boxes, there's nothing I haven't heard.

526
01:07:51,736 --> 01:07:55,573
Well, let's keep it that way.

527
01:08:02,663 --> 01:08:05,624
So we'll be seeing you Sunday,
then, huh?

528
01:08:25,519 --> 01:08:28,522
Oh, okay. I have to call you back,
because he just came in.

529
01:08:28,689 --> 01:08:30,191
Good morning.

530
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:32,818
Your ears must've been burning.

531
01:08:32,985 --> 01:08:36,322
- Why?
- This just came by messenger.

532
01:08:36,489 --> 01:08:40,701
It's your invitation to the Black
and White Ball at the Grand. Plus one.

533
01:08:40,868 --> 01:08:42,828
Plus one. All right.

534
01:08:45,664 --> 01:08:49,001
- Coffee?
- No. No, thank you.

535
01:08:49,168 --> 01:08:51,670
I'd love a cup, Karen. Thank you.

536
01:08:56,175 --> 01:08:58,511
Guess she's making a fresh pot.

537
01:09:00,513 --> 01:09:03,682
Wow, they spent some serious money
on this invitation.

538
01:09:03,849 --> 01:09:06,393
I mean, you should feel it. It's engraved.

539
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,730
- What time are you gonna pick me up?
- I'm not going.

540
01:09:09,939 --> 01:09:11,899
What? Are you crazy?

541
01:09:12,066 --> 01:09:14,985
That place is gonna be crawling
with people. Rich people.

542
01:09:15,152 --> 01:09:18,197
People who pay their legal fees
with money, not with fish...

543
01:09:18,364 --> 01:09:22,243
...or with wheels of cheese
or with sports supplies.

544
01:09:22,535 --> 01:09:26,539
I'll fill you in on a little secret.
This place doesn't look like a law office.

545
01:09:26,705 --> 01:09:28,749
It looks like the set of <i>Sanford and Son.</i>

546
01:09:28,958 --> 01:09:32,419
Every time I walk in, I'm waiting
for Lamont to walk down the stairs.

547
01:09:32,586 --> 01:09:35,673
- Then you go.
- Look at me, Matt. I'm a plus-one.

548
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:39,593
Plus-ones don't get anywhere alone.
They need somebody to bring them.

549
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:42,930
Are you finished? We only have
an hour to prepare for court.

550
01:09:43,097 --> 01:09:45,266
What's eating you?

551
01:09:48,561 --> 01:09:49,937
Rough night.

552
01:09:51,564 --> 01:09:53,774
Well, you wanna talk about it?

553
01:09:58,237 --> 01:09:59,446
No.

554
01:10:01,574 --> 01:10:03,576
It's about Elektra, isn't it?

555
01:10:03,742 --> 01:10:04,952
No.

556
01:10:05,244 --> 01:10:07,079
And Natchios owns the Grand Hotel...

557
01:10:07,246 --> 01:10:10,124
...and Elektra's the reason
you were invited to the ball.

558
01:10:10,749 --> 01:10:14,920
She's out of my league
and I'd rather just end it before it starts.

559
01:10:17,631 --> 01:10:19,383
That's gotta be some kind of record.

560
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:23,637
You just completely bypassed the whole
relationship phase, right into the breakup.

561
01:10:23,804 --> 01:10:25,472
Trying to save some time, huh?

562
01:10:25,639 --> 01:10:29,226
What happens to that lie detector
when it detects your own bullshit?

563
01:10:29,393 --> 01:10:31,645
Must really bury the needle, huh?

564
01:10:34,315 --> 01:10:36,233
Swish.

565
01:10:38,152 --> 01:10:41,280
Look, Matt, seriously,
the ball's in your court.

566
01:10:46,285 --> 01:10:47,828
Plus one, huh?

567
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:52,166
Thank you.

568
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:59,632
This is what I'm talking about.
Aren't you happy you listened to me?

569
01:10:59,798 --> 01:11:01,926
This is gonna be great
for business, Matt.

570
01:11:02,426 --> 01:11:03,677
Thank you.

571
01:11:04,303 --> 01:11:06,639
Matt Murdock. Ben Urich,
<i>New York Post.</i>

572
01:11:07,431 --> 01:11:09,183
Ben Urich, nice to meet you.

573
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:11,936
You write the articles
about urban legends, right?

574
01:11:12,144 --> 01:11:14,438
Well, yes, among other things.

575
01:11:14,605 --> 01:11:19,360
Settle something for us. You know
the alligators in the sewers? My partner--

576
01:11:19,526 --> 01:11:22,154
I followed that piece
you wrote about the Kingpin.

577
01:11:22,363 --> 01:11:27,284
One man running all the crime in New
York City sounds a little far-fetched.

578
01:11:27,576 --> 01:11:32,873
Yeah, but then again, so does a vigilante
who thinks every day is Halloween.

579
01:11:33,082 --> 01:11:35,960
They gotta be huge by now,
right, the alligators?

580
01:11:36,126 --> 01:11:37,628
It's a myth.

581
01:11:39,046 --> 01:11:42,132
Look, I'd like you to give me a call--

582
01:11:42,841 --> 01:11:44,593
Sorry.

583
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:50,015
Cool color.

584
01:11:50,182 --> 01:11:51,475
I wouldn't know.

585
01:11:52,685 --> 01:11:57,690
Yeah, but do give me a call. There is
something I'd like to talk to you about.

586
01:11:58,399 --> 01:12:00,526
Nice to meet you. Enjoy the party.

587
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:05,364
Look at that.
Wilson Fisk is in the hizzey.

588
01:12:05,906 --> 01:12:09,201
We might never get a chance
like this again. Come on, let's go.

589
01:12:09,576 --> 01:12:11,912
- We should talk about this.
- Mr. Fisk. Hi.

590
01:12:12,079 --> 01:12:14,748
It's Franklin Nelson
from Nelson & Murdock--

591
01:12:14,915 --> 01:12:18,419
Hey, yeah, you wanna talk to Mr. Fisk,
you make an appointment.

592
01:12:18,752 --> 01:12:23,215
- Okay?
- Wesley. I know who you are.

593
01:12:23,382 --> 01:12:25,843
You're the blind lawyers
from Hell's Kitchen.

594
01:12:26,176 --> 01:12:28,762
Right. Actually, he's the blind one.

595
01:12:28,929 --> 01:12:31,223
I'm deaf.

596
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:32,933
Give them a card, Wesley.

597
01:12:33,142 --> 01:12:35,602
I'm always on the lookout
for new blood.

598
01:12:35,769 --> 01:12:38,772
I'm sorry, Mr. Fisk.
My partner's a little overzealous.

599
01:12:38,939 --> 01:12:41,233
We can't represent you.

600
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:43,444
And why is that?

601
01:12:43,694 --> 01:12:45,529
Yes, why is that, Mr. Murdock?

602
01:12:45,946 --> 01:12:50,159
Because we only handle
clients who are innocent.

603
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:54,621
"Innocent," he said. He's pretty funny.

604
01:12:54,788 --> 01:12:57,416
I've learned one thing
in my years in this business.

605
01:12:57,708 --> 01:12:58,959
What's that?

606
01:12:59,209 --> 01:13:01,754
Nobody's innocent.

607
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:04,173
Nobody.

608
01:13:06,425 --> 01:13:10,095
- Have a great time at the party.
- Thank you.

609
01:13:10,262 --> 01:13:14,266
I just-- You know, Matt,
for one night, I just wish...

610
01:13:14,433 --> 01:13:17,061
I just...

611
01:13:17,478 --> 01:13:21,648
Matt, I just wish I could
give you my eyes for one night.

612
01:13:22,566 --> 01:13:25,319
- It's like that?
- It's like that.

613
01:13:29,656 --> 01:13:32,326
You want me to take you
up there, Matt? Matt?

614
01:13:32,993 --> 01:13:35,412
Matt?

615
01:14:16,245 --> 01:14:18,539
Now I found you.

616
01:14:21,333 --> 01:14:24,461
Look, I'm really sorry
about the other night.

617
01:14:24,628 --> 01:14:25,879
You're here now.

618
01:14:28,173 --> 01:14:31,051
That's all that matters.

619
01:14:31,885 --> 01:14:34,304
Wow, engraved cuff links, huh?

620
01:14:34,555 --> 01:14:37,558
- Because it's Wesley Owen Welch--
- Let me cut to the chase.

621
01:14:37,724 --> 01:14:39,560
If this were up to me, and it is...

622
01:14:39,726 --> 01:14:42,896
...do you really think
that this corporation would hire...

623
01:14:43,063 --> 01:14:47,734
...some pro Bono, storefront Hell's
Kitchen lawyers, let alone a blind one?

624
01:14:47,901 --> 01:14:53,532
Come on. I've already filled our quota
of handicapped employees for the year.

625
01:14:54,074 --> 01:14:58,203
Go back to the Kitchen, Franklin Nelson.

626
01:15:03,083 --> 01:15:04,918
That dick.

627
01:15:10,048 --> 01:15:13,093
You look beautiful tonight.

628
01:15:20,851 --> 01:15:22,603
Do you mind?

629
01:15:24,062 --> 01:15:29,401
No, I just-- Sometimes it makes
people uncomfortable, that's all.

630
01:15:29,568 --> 01:15:31,904
Not me.

631
01:15:33,363 --> 01:15:35,699
But you should know...

632
01:15:35,866 --> 01:15:39,244
...that the only reason
I got dressed up for this thing...

633
01:15:39,411 --> 01:15:42,581
...was that I wanted
to look beautiful for you.

634
01:15:45,626 --> 01:15:48,712
I wish you could see me tonight.

635
01:15:49,254 --> 01:15:51,590
Me too.

636
01:15:57,429 --> 01:15:58,847
Matt.

637
01:15:59,097 --> 01:16:01,058
What's wrong?

638
01:16:01,225 --> 01:16:03,227
It's just...

639
01:16:04,561 --> 01:16:06,813
...good things don't happen
to me very often.

640
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:09,149
When they do, I get scared.

641
01:16:10,776 --> 01:16:15,781
Nothing bad is gonna happen. I promise.

642
01:16:29,127 --> 01:16:30,337
Hi.

643
01:16:30,504 --> 01:16:33,632
Hello. Hello.

644
01:16:36,843 --> 01:16:38,512
Hello.

645
01:16:47,479 --> 01:16:49,856
Doesn't she look beautiful?

646
01:16:50,023 --> 01:16:52,192
I think she's happy.

647
01:16:52,442 --> 01:16:56,363
I haven't seen her smile like that
since before her mother was killed.

648
01:16:56,530 --> 01:16:59,866
Poor girl. Right in front of her eyes.

649
01:17:00,033 --> 01:17:02,035
What, you have to bring that up now?

650
01:17:02,202 --> 01:17:05,831
History has a way of repeating itself.

651
01:17:05,998 --> 01:17:10,877
- What are you saying?
- Just saying goodbye, old friend.

652
01:17:12,546 --> 01:17:15,173
Just saying goodbye.

653
01:17:29,229 --> 01:17:31,023
- Something's happening.
- What is it?

654
01:17:31,189 --> 01:17:32,941
Papa!

655
01:17:35,068 --> 01:17:37,237
Go back to the party.

656
01:17:37,404 --> 01:17:38,655
What's wrong?

657
01:17:38,822 --> 01:17:40,574
Elektra!

658
01:17:40,741 --> 01:17:43,076
Stavros will take you home.

659
01:17:43,243 --> 01:17:46,204
Papa. Papa.

660
01:17:48,206 --> 01:17:49,958
Tell me where you're going.

661
01:17:51,084 --> 01:17:52,586
You wait.

662
01:17:58,884 --> 01:18:01,053
I'm sorry.

663
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,638
- What is going on?
- New York is not a safe place tonight.

664
01:18:44,805 --> 01:18:46,098
That's all you need to know.

665
01:19:08,036 --> 01:19:09,287
Watch out!

666
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:33,478
I missed. I never miss.

667
01:20:01,214 --> 01:20:03,008
Drop something?

668
01:20:27,699 --> 01:20:30,368
Bullseye.

669
01:21:12,661 --> 01:21:14,955
Daddy.

670
01:21:34,766 --> 01:21:36,935
Get that over to Forensics right away.

671
01:21:37,102 --> 01:21:38,395
Hey, Nick.

672
01:21:38,562 --> 01:21:42,190
What do you want, Urich?
Does all this make you happy?

673
01:21:44,484 --> 01:21:47,279
Looks like you got your story.

674
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:28,695
<i>Police are still investigating the murder
of Nikolaos Natchios--</i>

675
01:22:28,862 --> 01:22:31,364
<i>--will identify Natchios
as the so-called Kingpin.</i>

676
01:22:31,531 --> 01:22:34,701
<i>--believes that the self-styled
vigilante is wanted for murder.</i>

677
01:22:34,868 --> 01:22:36,995
<i>--implication of Daredevil.</i>

678
01:22:40,248 --> 01:22:42,834
How did you get past my security?

679
01:22:43,627 --> 01:22:45,545
Oh, you mean that guy?

680
01:22:47,505 --> 01:22:49,132
Was that really necessary?

681
01:22:49,299 --> 01:22:52,177
Necessary? No, it was fun.

682
01:22:52,802 --> 01:22:55,513
You know, you've exceeded
all my expectations.

683
01:22:56,556 --> 01:23:01,686
You even managed to implicate Daredevil
in the process. You should be pleased.

684
01:23:02,270 --> 01:23:04,022
He...

685
01:23:04,189 --> 01:23:06,524
...made me...

686
01:23:07,567 --> 01:23:09,152
...miss.

687
01:23:09,319 --> 01:23:15,784
There's an old saying that
too much pride can kill a man.

688
01:23:19,037 --> 01:23:21,331
The devil is mine.

689
01:23:21,539 --> 01:23:23,083
Really?

690
01:23:23,249 --> 01:23:29,089
I've heard that before, all too
many times. But answer me this:

691
01:23:29,297 --> 01:23:32,801
How do you kill a man without fear?

692
01:23:33,551 --> 01:23:36,388
By putting the fear in him.

693
01:23:37,931 --> 01:23:41,267
I like that. But first...

694
01:23:45,563 --> 01:23:48,441
...give Elektra all my best.

695
01:23:49,109 --> 01:23:51,611
Is there anything else?

696
01:23:52,112 --> 01:23:53,905
Yeah.

697
01:23:56,116 --> 01:23:59,244
I want a fucking costume.

698
01:24:04,124 --> 01:24:07,127
And what happened from there,
Mr. Jackson?

699
01:24:07,293 --> 01:24:09,379
Oh, well, let's see...

700
01:24:10,797 --> 01:24:13,967
Man, I was so high,
I can't remember everything.

701
01:24:17,137 --> 01:24:20,765
Excuse me one second, Your Honor,
I'm working alone here today.

702
01:24:21,641 --> 01:24:23,476
Just a second.

703
01:24:27,647 --> 01:24:31,401
It's Braille. It's Braille.

704
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:37,991
It says here-- Okay, Mr. Jackson,
it says here that you were...

705
01:24:38,158 --> 01:24:41,911
...at Chumley's...
Chumley's Tavern until 10:15...

706
01:24:42,078 --> 01:24:44,330
...and then you went to meet a friend.

707
01:24:44,497 --> 01:24:49,586
Terp. That's right, I went to meet Terp
because he owed me some money.

708
01:24:49,753 --> 01:24:54,132
Yes! And it was there that you passed
out from drinking. Is that correct?

709
01:24:55,008 --> 01:24:57,510
Smoking weed, mostly.

710
01:25:00,430 --> 01:25:03,975
Thank you for clarifying that.
Now, Officer Mackenzie has testified...

711
01:25:04,142 --> 01:25:06,519
...you were found
at that time holding a handgun.

712
01:25:06,686 --> 01:25:09,689
- That's a lie.
- In fact, you don't own a handgun...

713
01:25:09,856 --> 01:25:11,775
- ...do you?
- No, sir.

714
01:25:11,941 --> 01:25:14,360
- Have you ever owned a handgun?
- No, sir.

715
01:25:15,653 --> 01:25:18,114
Do you have any intention
of owning a handgun?

716
01:25:18,281 --> 01:25:20,450
- No, sir.
- Thank you.

717
01:25:20,617 --> 01:25:23,203
Can't hit nothing with a handgun.

718
01:25:23,369 --> 01:25:25,163
- Thank you.
- But a shotgun...

719
01:25:25,330 --> 01:25:28,374
...now that's a whole different story.
Shotgun got buckshot.

720
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:30,502
- That's all.
- When you shoot it...

721
01:25:30,668 --> 01:25:33,713
...they spray out.
So it can hit everything in front of it.

722
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:37,383
Thank you, Mr. Jackson.
I have no further questions, Your Honor.

723
01:25:37,550 --> 01:25:39,052
Court's in recess.

724
01:25:40,386 --> 01:25:42,013
Mr. Nelson.

725
01:25:44,641 --> 01:25:49,354
For your sake, I hope your partner
comes back soon.

726
01:25:49,729 --> 01:25:53,024
Me too. Me too.

727
01:26:44,284 --> 01:26:47,537
- I know how you feel.
- You don't know how I feel.

728
01:26:51,416 --> 01:26:53,751
I want revenge.

729
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:01,259
Revenge won't make the pain go away.
Trust me. I know.

730
01:27:05,513 --> 01:27:08,141
There's no place for me now.

731
01:27:08,516 --> 01:27:10,393
Yes, there is.

732
01:27:11,477 --> 01:27:13,479
Stay.

733
01:27:13,813 --> 01:27:15,648
Stay with me.

734
01:27:17,650 --> 01:27:19,319
Please.

735
01:27:55,313 --> 01:27:56,856
Elektra.

736
01:27:57,023 --> 01:27:59,025
Elektra, wait.

737
01:28:00,068 --> 01:28:01,486
Please.

738
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:17,460
Drive.

739
01:28:45,071 --> 01:28:46,406
Matt.

740
01:28:46,614 --> 01:28:47,907
Why are you following me?

741
01:28:48,074 --> 01:28:51,661
- It's me, Ben Urich.
- Yeah, I know who it is.

742
01:28:59,585 --> 01:29:00,920
What do you want?

743
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:03,089
Your client's innocent.

744
01:29:16,936 --> 01:29:18,521
Well?

745
01:29:19,272 --> 01:29:23,109
I have a source for my Kingpin story...

746
01:29:23,276 --> 01:29:24,944
...named Lisa Tazio.

747
01:29:25,153 --> 01:29:27,030
Lisa Tazio had access to the Kingpin?

748
01:29:27,196 --> 01:29:30,199
No. One of his guys. Pillow talk.

749
01:29:30,366 --> 01:29:34,287
She was selling me information
bit by bit. I never got a name.

750
01:29:34,454 --> 01:29:35,788
Will you testify to that?

751
01:29:36,289 --> 01:29:41,210
First Amendment and all that. Plus, the
case is still open, far as I'm concerned.

752
01:29:41,377 --> 01:29:43,463
Can you tell me anything
that could help?

753
01:29:43,629 --> 01:29:49,135
Yeah. I got a cousin over in Hoboken,
runs a Mercedes dealership.

754
01:29:49,302 --> 01:29:52,930
He sold a 500 SL to a Robert Mackenzie.

755
01:29:54,974 --> 01:29:59,145
Officer Mackenzie. Doesn't make sense.
He was telling the truth.

756
01:29:59,312 --> 01:30:01,397
Matt...

757
01:30:01,564 --> 01:30:03,816
...that's three years' cop salary.

758
01:30:03,983 --> 01:30:05,985
Guy ain't telling the truth.

759
01:30:14,827 --> 01:30:17,663
Could've bought him a future.
Our future.

760
01:30:17,830 --> 01:30:20,166
Our children.

761
01:30:34,931 --> 01:30:37,266
Gotta love that new-car smell,
huh, Mackenzie?

762
01:30:37,433 --> 01:30:38,935
Murdock, what the--?

763
01:30:45,525 --> 01:30:48,027
Never driven a stick shift.
How does this work?

764
01:30:48,194 --> 01:30:49,862
- Stop it!
- Take it easy, Mackenzie.

765
01:30:50,029 --> 01:30:52,532
We'll go for a ride. Nice car.
Where'd you get it?

766
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:55,159
- Lots of cops got Mercedes these days.
- Yeah.

767
01:30:56,119 --> 01:30:57,703
I'll bet.

768
01:30:59,789 --> 01:31:01,999
Jesus Christ!

769
01:31:02,166 --> 01:31:03,709
- You're crazy!
- Yeah, I'm crazy.

770
01:31:03,876 --> 01:31:06,796
- Who killed Lisa Tazio?
- Dante Jackson.

771
01:31:10,133 --> 01:31:11,634
Stop the goddamn car!

772
01:31:11,801 --> 01:31:14,178
See, here's the hard part,
parallel parking.

773
01:31:14,345 --> 01:31:16,556
How is it, like this?

774
01:31:19,851 --> 01:31:21,310
What do you want?

775
01:31:21,477 --> 01:31:24,313
I wanna know why your goddamn
heart rate hasn't changed.

776
01:31:32,864 --> 01:31:36,200
- When'd you get the pacemaker?
- Three years ago. So what?

777
01:31:36,367 --> 01:31:38,494
You lied in court. That's perjury.

778
01:31:38,661 --> 01:31:40,746
You think I'm the only one?

779
01:31:41,831 --> 01:31:45,084
You take me down, there's 100 more
just like me to take my place.

780
01:31:45,376 --> 01:31:47,253
This is bigger than you, Murdock.

781
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:49,297
It's bigger than all of us.

782
01:31:50,715 --> 01:31:52,216
The Kingpin.

783
01:31:52,383 --> 01:31:54,927
He runs the whole goddamn town.

784
01:31:55,094 --> 01:31:57,930
You cross him, you're gonna end up
like Natchios.

785
01:31:58,097 --> 01:32:01,225
Eighty-sixed by some maniac
like Bullseye.

786
01:32:01,392 --> 01:32:02,894
And he won't stop there.

787
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:06,772
- What does that mean?
- Kingpin doesn't just kill you.

788
01:32:06,939 --> 01:32:09,525
He kills your whole family.

789
01:32:26,959 --> 01:32:29,045
I have coffee.

790
01:32:30,463 --> 01:32:32,298
Did you get ahold of Matt?

791
01:32:32,465 --> 01:32:36,093
No. He'll call. Don't worry.

792
01:32:36,427 --> 01:32:38,137
You should really get home, Karen.

793
01:32:38,346 --> 01:32:40,431
I'm fine. How are you doing?

794
01:32:40,598 --> 01:32:42,475
Oh, me? I'm great.

795
01:32:42,642 --> 01:32:46,312
I'm making ridiculously little progress...

796
01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:49,106
...for the amount of time
I've invested in this.

797
01:32:49,273 --> 01:32:51,943
- Is your mom coming to town?
- My mom? No.

798
01:32:52,109 --> 01:32:54,153
- What's that note?
- Oh, that?

799
01:32:54,362 --> 01:32:57,281
That's Matt's big contribution
to the Tazio case...

800
01:32:57,448 --> 01:33:00,993
...which has surprisingly turned out
to be completely useless.

801
01:33:04,830 --> 01:33:07,166
What's the date of the murder?

802
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,919
August 9th. Why?

803
01:33:10,836 --> 01:33:12,838
Maybe you're looking at it wrong.

804
01:33:13,005 --> 01:33:14,507
August 9th.

805
01:33:23,683 --> 01:33:25,851
August 9th, wow.

806
01:33:33,401 --> 01:33:36,362
"Wesley Owen Welch."

807
01:33:37,029 --> 01:33:38,948
Son of a bitch.

808
01:33:43,035 --> 01:33:45,204
Oh, cha-ching.

809
01:33:46,205 --> 01:33:48,708
This better be good, Kirby.

810
01:33:50,710 --> 01:33:55,298
You know me, Urich.
It's always good. Come here.

811
01:34:06,892 --> 01:34:12,148
Okay. Are you ready to see
something really, really cool?

812
01:34:12,982 --> 01:34:15,985
- Come on.
- Okay.

813
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:24,076
- Come on, man. I'm throwing you gold.
- Give me my money.

814
01:34:24,243 --> 01:34:25,911
- Why?
- I've seen it. Come on.

815
01:34:26,078 --> 01:34:28,914
All right, well...
But have you seen this?

816
01:34:35,421 --> 01:34:39,342
And tighty righty, loosey left--

817
01:34:41,344 --> 01:34:44,430
You said to look out
for anything weird, yes?

818
01:34:46,682 --> 01:34:49,435
That's some pretty weird shit
right here, man, right?

819
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:53,356
You have no idea.

820
01:34:58,778 --> 01:35:00,571
Yeah.

821
01:35:01,864 --> 01:35:04,533
- Yeah.
- Yeah, this is Franklin Nelson.

822
01:35:06,202 --> 01:35:07,745
This is not a good time.

823
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:09,872
It's about Lisa Tazio.

824
01:38:06,799 --> 01:38:08,467
Remember me?

825
01:38:09,969 --> 01:38:11,554
Wait!

826
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:15,641
It wasn't me.

827
01:38:16,559 --> 01:38:19,687
Stop!
It was a hit man named Bullseye.

828
01:38:21,814 --> 01:38:24,275
- I didn't kill your father.
- Liar.

829
01:39:00,352 --> 01:39:03,439
- I'm not gonna fight you.
- Good.

830
01:39:03,606 --> 01:39:04,857
Then this will be quick.

831
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:38,349
I wanna look into the eyes
of my father's killer as he dies.

832
01:39:38,515 --> 01:39:40,726
Wait. Wait.

833
01:39:46,065 --> 01:39:49,068
Now you know.

834
01:39:50,027 --> 01:39:51,570
Oh, God.

835
01:39:51,737 --> 01:39:56,742
I was just trying to protect you, Elektra.

836
01:39:56,909 --> 01:40:00,829
- I'm sorry.
- Elektra.

837
01:40:04,041 --> 01:40:06,543
That's him. That's Bullseye.

838
01:40:06,710 --> 01:40:08,587
Listen to me. You have to run.

839
01:40:09,421 --> 01:40:12,424
- He has to pay for what he's done.
- No, you don't understand.

840
01:40:12,591 --> 01:40:15,427
I don't wanna lose you again.

841
01:40:15,928 --> 01:40:18,097
I'll find you.

842
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:23,435
Come on, girl.

843
01:40:40,953 --> 01:40:44,623
Hey, orphan. Let's play.

844
01:40:51,463 --> 01:40:53,424
Nice. Come on.

845
01:42:14,963 --> 01:42:18,050
You're good, baby. I'll give you that.

846
01:42:18,217 --> 01:42:20,052
But me...

847
01:42:22,638 --> 01:42:23,889
...I'm magic.

848
01:42:50,874 --> 01:42:53,752
And now for my next trick.

849
01:42:55,838 --> 01:42:59,341
No! No!

850
01:43:20,988 --> 01:43:25,284
<i>N.Y.P.D. Aviation.
Please do not move.</i>

851
01:43:25,492 --> 01:43:28,537
<i>Get on your knees
and put your hands on your head.</i>

852
01:43:28,704 --> 01:43:34,251
<i>I repeat, get on your knees
and put your hands on your head.</i>

853
01:43:55,772 --> 01:43:57,608
Help me.

854
01:44:00,319 --> 01:44:03,906
Stay. Just stay with me.

855
01:44:36,772 --> 01:44:38,607
Everything's clear.

856
01:45:10,013 --> 01:45:14,518
Matthew. Matthew.

857
01:45:14,685 --> 01:45:17,104
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

858
01:45:19,982 --> 01:45:21,817
This is my confession, Father.

859
01:45:21,984 --> 01:45:26,822
God's mercy is infinite.
All you gotta do is ask.

860
01:45:26,989 --> 01:45:30,325
Everything I had
has been taken from me.

861
01:45:30,909 --> 01:45:33,161
Now I'm supposed to ask for mercy?

862
01:45:33,328 --> 01:45:36,498
I don't ask for mercy. People ask me.

863
01:45:36,665 --> 01:45:38,667
Oh, is that a fact?

864
01:45:45,048 --> 01:45:47,426
First one's a warning...

865
01:45:49,177 --> 01:45:50,762
...Padre.

866
01:45:51,346 --> 01:45:53,265
- Is there a back door out of here?
- Yeah.

867
01:45:53,432 --> 01:45:56,101
- Take it. Call the police.
- What about you?

868
01:45:58,061 --> 01:46:00,731
- I have to finish this.
- You can't fight like this.

869
01:46:01,231 --> 01:46:05,277
Have faith, Father. Isn't that right?

870
01:46:15,662 --> 01:46:17,289
You.

871
01:46:17,456 --> 01:46:18,957
Let's play.

872
01:47:58,390 --> 01:48:02,185
Kane, I want the blueprints and
the city grids. Secure the perimeter.

873
01:48:02,394 --> 01:48:05,147
- Yes, sir.
- Where the hell's my SWAT team?

874
01:48:05,313 --> 01:48:08,567
- Doors are locked from the inside, sir.
- Break them down.

875
01:48:08,775 --> 01:48:11,194
- It's a church, sir.
- Your point?

876
01:48:11,778 --> 01:48:14,239
Yes, sir. Let's get a battering ram
in here now.

877
01:48:14,406 --> 01:48:15,740
You got it.

878
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:15,091
Let's go.

879
01:49:15,258 --> 01:49:17,594
Let's go. Let's go. Go, go, go.

880
01:49:17,761 --> 01:49:20,639
- Hey, Coyle. Keep them in your sights.
- Which one?

881
01:49:20,805 --> 01:49:23,266
Both of them.
I want a man on that roof.

882
01:49:23,433 --> 01:49:24,768
Ready?

883
01:49:26,645 --> 01:49:32,817
The man without fear. Looks like
I found something you're afraid of.

884
01:49:32,984 --> 01:49:35,362
Let's bring on the pain.

885
01:49:38,156 --> 01:49:42,369
Let's bring on the noise.

886
01:49:54,005 --> 01:49:57,884
Fisk was right about you.
He said you wouldn't go easy.

887
01:49:58,093 --> 01:50:01,513
Fisk? Fisk is the Kingpin?

888
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:03,181
Yeah.

889
01:50:03,848 --> 01:50:08,687
The whole red rose thing,
he loves that shit. It's not my style.

890
01:50:16,027 --> 01:50:22,033
He hired me to kill Natchios.
And to gut your pretty girlfriend too.

891
01:50:24,369 --> 01:50:26,913
But me, I'm going for the hat trick.

892
01:50:27,122 --> 01:50:29,457
I told him I'd do you for free.

893
01:50:35,297 --> 01:50:38,049
The devil is mine.

894
01:50:52,314 --> 01:50:55,442
Oh, my hands! My hands.

895
01:50:59,821 --> 01:51:02,198
You took away my hands.

896
01:51:02,949 --> 01:51:04,743
Show mercy?

897
01:51:28,391 --> 01:51:30,101
Bull's-eye.

898
01:51:30,977 --> 01:51:34,481
- Freeze!
- Don't move!

899
01:51:36,900 --> 01:51:39,277
Detective, look!

900
01:51:44,491 --> 01:51:46,785
Good luck, son.

901
01:51:51,289 --> 01:51:53,291
There's been a problem.

902
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:55,377
Bullseye failed.

903
01:51:55,543 --> 01:51:57,003
Correct.

904
01:51:57,921 --> 01:51:59,589
Then he'll be coming here next.

905
01:51:59,756 --> 01:52:01,091
Why would you say that?

906
01:52:01,257 --> 01:52:03,593
Because that's what I would do.

907
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:06,596
Well, then we'll be ready for him, sir.

908
01:52:10,225 --> 01:52:12,018
Send the guards home.

909
01:52:13,311 --> 01:52:15,814
- But, sir--
- I was raised in the Bronx, Wesley.

910
01:52:16,022 --> 01:52:19,984
This is something
you wouldn't understand.

911
01:52:20,944 --> 01:52:22,445
Yes, sir.

912
01:52:31,329 --> 01:52:33,665
- I have to talk to you.
- Give me a break, Urich.

913
01:52:33,832 --> 01:52:36,960
- Doors are open, detective.
- Terrific. Just in time.

914
01:52:37,127 --> 01:52:39,963
- Keep those people back!
- You're gonna wanna hear this.

915
01:52:40,130 --> 01:52:42,507
I just got an anonymous tip
on the Tazio murder.

916
01:52:42,674 --> 01:52:45,301
Phone it in.
I got much bigger problems tonight.

917
01:52:45,468 --> 01:52:48,012
It leads to Wilson Fisk.

918
01:52:48,179 --> 01:52:50,682
Nick, he's the Kingpin,
and I can prove it.

919
01:52:51,474 --> 01:52:53,268
Come on, you got nothing on Fisk.

920
01:52:53,435 --> 01:52:57,021
No. But I got the guy that does.

921
01:52:59,858 --> 01:53:04,529
- Would you care for another martini, sir?
- No, I come here for the view, asshole.

922
01:53:06,322 --> 01:53:08,533
Wesley Owen Welch?

923
01:53:08,700 --> 01:53:10,160
Who wants to know?

924
01:53:10,326 --> 01:53:15,832
Detective Nick Manolis. I'd like to talk
to you about the murder of Lisa Tazio.

925
01:53:15,999 --> 01:53:19,669
- I want my lawyer.
- I haven't charged you with anything.

926
01:53:19,878 --> 01:53:23,339
I won't talk to you
without my lawyer present.

927
01:53:23,673 --> 01:53:27,051
All right. Then I'll talk. You listen.

928
01:53:27,844 --> 01:53:30,889
And then we can talk
about your plea bargain.

929
01:53:35,518 --> 01:53:37,353
Check.

930
01:54:23,525 --> 01:54:25,860
Daredevil.

931
01:54:26,027 --> 01:54:28,696
Kingpin.

932
01:55:34,137 --> 01:55:36,681
It's a shame you came here wounded.

933
01:55:37,807 --> 01:55:40,935
I would have loved to fight you
in your prime.

934
01:55:42,854 --> 01:55:46,149
They call you the man without fear.

935
01:55:47,609 --> 01:55:53,448
If that's true, why are you afraid
to show your face?

936
01:55:54,866 --> 01:55:57,035
I don't believe it.

937
01:55:57,201 --> 01:55:59,704
No. No.

938
01:55:59,871 --> 01:56:03,708
The blind lawyer from Hell's Kitchen?

939
01:56:05,543 --> 01:56:10,381
You killed the only two people
I ever loved.

940
01:56:10,548 --> 01:56:11,883
Why?

941
01:56:13,885 --> 01:56:16,387
Business.

942
01:56:16,596 --> 01:56:19,223
That's all it ever is, business.

943
01:56:19,515 --> 01:56:21,893
I was working for Fallon at the time.

944
01:56:22,101 --> 01:56:25,396
Your father was supposed
to throw a fight...

945
01:56:25,563 --> 01:56:31,611
...and your girl was in the wrong family
at the wrong time.

946
01:56:32,111 --> 01:56:35,490
It's always business.

947
01:56:35,657 --> 01:56:36,991
<i>I'll find you.</i>

948
01:56:37,533 --> 01:56:41,245
You've been in my business
for too long.

949
01:57:40,471 --> 01:57:45,435
I've been thinking about this day
since I was 12 years old.

950
01:58:12,503 --> 01:58:15,131
I don't understand.

951
01:58:20,678 --> 01:58:23,139
I'm not the bad guy.

952
01:58:25,975 --> 01:58:29,020
You hear that, blind man?

953
01:58:29,187 --> 01:58:31,355
The sirens.

954
01:58:31,522 --> 01:58:33,149
They're coming for you.

955
01:58:33,858 --> 01:58:36,152
For me?

956
01:58:36,319 --> 01:58:38,196
Didn't you hear?

957
01:58:38,362 --> 01:58:40,323
The word's out on the Kingpin.

958
01:58:40,531 --> 01:58:41,991
They're coming for you.

959
01:58:42,158 --> 01:58:44,368
I can hear the police radios from here.

960
01:58:44,535 --> 01:58:46,662
No, no.

961
01:58:46,829 --> 01:58:49,540
I swear I'll tell them who you are.

962
01:58:49,749 --> 01:58:53,127
Yeah? Go ahead, tell them.

963
01:58:53,294 --> 01:58:57,256
Tell the guys at Riker's all about
how you got beat by a blind man.

964
01:58:59,050 --> 01:59:01,344
It'll be like blood in the water.

965
01:59:03,221 --> 01:59:06,557
Don't worry about that,
because I'll get out.

966
01:59:06,849 --> 01:59:10,186
Yeah, I know.

967
01:59:11,020 --> 01:59:13,272
And I'll be waiting.

968
01:59:16,901 --> 01:59:19,779
Justice is served.

969
01:59:26,786 --> 01:59:28,663
I'll get you.

970
01:59:28,871 --> 01:59:31,415
I'll get you.

971
01:59:32,083 --> 01:59:35,753
It's not over with yet.

972
01:59:37,421 --> 01:59:41,592
Not over with Daredevil.

973
01:59:52,019 --> 01:59:55,106
This is for you, Dad.

974
02:00:15,376 --> 02:00:16,627
Congratulations.

975
02:00:16,794 --> 02:00:19,171
Thank you, Mr. Murdock.
I appreciate everything.

976
02:00:19,338 --> 02:00:22,258
- Yeah, seriously, congratulations.
- You the man, though.

977
02:00:22,425 --> 02:00:24,594
All right, yeah. Keep it real.
All right.

978
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:27,763
I appreciate everything, man.
I'm feeling you, man.

979
02:00:27,930 --> 02:00:31,851
If you ever need anything, you come
down to 117th Street, you ask for me.

980
02:00:32,018 --> 02:00:34,812
- So great. So great.
- That's it, dog.

981
02:00:34,979 --> 02:00:38,149
Stuck by me. Nobody wanted
to touch me with a 20,000-foot pole.

982
02:00:38,316 --> 02:00:41,527
- I feel you.
- I appreciate that, man.

983
02:00:41,694 --> 02:00:44,113
I could cry right now.
You like a brother to me.

984
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:46,157
You know what I'm saying?

985
02:00:47,700 --> 02:00:51,829
"Though there were no witnesses, police
think Daredevil brought Fisk to justice."

986
02:00:51,996 --> 02:00:53,623
There were no eyewitnesses.

987
02:00:53,998 --> 02:00:56,375
It's in black and white.
How can you be a skeptic?

988
02:00:56,542 --> 02:00:59,503
If there's no eyewitnesses--
Bigfoot has eyewitnesses.

989
02:00:59,670 --> 02:01:01,839
- Please.
- The alligators in the sewers--

990
02:01:02,048 --> 02:01:04,175
So there are alligators in the sewers?

991
02:01:04,342 --> 02:01:06,385
I didn't admit that. I'm explaining--

992
02:01:06,552 --> 02:01:09,680
Do you concede that there are
alligators in the sewers?

993
02:01:10,514 --> 02:01:12,975
- Do I concede that? No.
- Answer the question.

994
02:01:13,142 --> 02:01:15,519
How can you not concede? You--

995
02:01:19,023 --> 02:01:21,192
Judy, we're over here.

996
02:01:28,032 --> 02:01:30,326
How you doing?

997
02:01:31,327 --> 02:01:33,162
I'm doing okay. I'll be all right.

998
02:01:33,371 --> 02:01:34,872
You wanna talk about it?

999
02:01:35,539 --> 02:01:38,084
No, but thanks.

1000
02:01:42,421 --> 02:01:44,757
- I'm gonna get some air.
- I got this.

1001
02:01:44,924 --> 02:01:46,592
Thanks.

1002
02:02:04,902 --> 02:02:07,655
Good to see you.
And you too. How are you?

1003
02:02:07,822 --> 02:02:10,324
Nice to see you.

1004
02:02:10,491 --> 02:02:12,410
- Thank you so much.
- Bye, now.

1005
02:02:12,576 --> 02:02:15,746
See you next week. Okay.

1006
02:02:20,084 --> 02:02:21,919
Maybe next week, Matt, huh?

1007
02:02:24,672 --> 02:02:25,923
Maybe.

1008
02:02:34,348 --> 02:02:36,017
Matt.

1009
02:02:37,184 --> 02:02:38,853
Ben.

1010
02:02:39,687 --> 02:02:41,689
Promised my kids I'd quit.

1011
02:02:41,856 --> 02:02:44,275
Gum's gonna kill me quicker.

1012
02:02:45,234 --> 02:02:46,444
How are you?

1013
02:02:46,694 --> 02:02:48,529
I'm all right. I'm good. Thank you.

1014
02:02:48,696 --> 02:02:52,616
Well, don't thank me so quick.

1015
02:02:52,783 --> 02:02:56,537
See, there's this other story
I've been working on.

1016
02:02:56,704 --> 02:02:59,957
I wanted to tell you about it
before it hit the paper.

1017
02:03:00,541 --> 02:03:03,085
I know the truth about Daredevil.

1018
02:03:03,961 --> 02:03:06,589
Justice is blind.

1019
02:03:08,382 --> 02:03:13,054
Ben, if you run that story...

1020
02:03:13,971 --> 02:03:15,639
...I'm finished.

1021
02:03:20,728 --> 02:03:23,147
But I'm a reporter, kid.

1022
02:03:24,315 --> 02:03:26,150
It's what I do.

1023
02:03:32,573 --> 02:03:34,658
<i>Violence doesn't discriminate.</i>

1024
02:03:35,910 --> 02:03:37,995
<i>It hits all of us.</i>

1025
02:03:40,915 --> 02:03:44,919
<i>The rich, the poor, the healthy, the sick.</i>

1026
02:03:45,086 --> 02:03:49,840
<i>It comes as cold and bracing
as a winter breeze off the Hudson...</i>

1027
02:03:50,007 --> 02:03:52,551
<i>...until it sinks into your bones...</i>

1028
02:03:52,718 --> 02:03:55,930
<i>...leaving you with a chill
you can't shake.</i>

1029
02:04:08,859 --> 02:04:11,987
<i>They say there's no rest for the wicked.</i>

1030
02:04:13,364 --> 02:04:15,699
<i>But what about the good?</i>

1031
02:04:18,661 --> 02:04:22,331
<i>The battle of good versus evil
is never-ending...</i>

1032
02:04:26,210 --> 02:04:28,879
<i>...because evil always survives...</i>

1033
02:04:30,172 --> 02:04:31,382
Bull's-eye.

1034
02:04:31,549 --> 02:04:33,509
<i>...with the help of evil men.</i>

1035
02:05:12,965 --> 02:05:15,050
Braille.

1036
02:05:45,873 --> 02:05:47,708
<i>As for Daredevil, well...</i>

1037
02:05:50,377 --> 02:05:53,964
<i>Soon the world will know the truth:</i>

1038
02:05:58,469 --> 02:06:02,431
<i>That this is a city born of heroes.</i>

1039
02:06:03,599 --> 02:06:07,603
<i>That one man can make a difference.</i>

1040
02:06:25,412 --> 02:06:27,331
Go get them, Matt.

1041
02:06:28,415 --> 02:06:31,168
<i>Hell's Kitchen is my neighborhood.</i>

1042
02:06:31,335 --> 02:06:34,463
<i>I prowl the rooftops and alleyways
at night...</i>

1043
02:06:34,672 --> 02:06:36,966
<i>...watching from the darkness.</i>

1044
02:06:37,132 --> 02:06:39,969
<i>Forever in darkness...</i>

1045
02:06:41,762 --> 02:06:44,640
<i>...a guardian devil.</i>
