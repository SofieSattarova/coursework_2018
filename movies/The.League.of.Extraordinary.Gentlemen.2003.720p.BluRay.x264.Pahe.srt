
1
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:22,206
Moorgate Passage.

2
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:25,918
I see it over there!

3
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,428
Bleeding rat-wags!
What's gotten into them?

4
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,480
What in God's name is that?

5
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:57,241
Halt!

6
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:02,038
-Blimey!
-Stop!

7
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,789
-Come on!
-Halt!

8
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,625
In the name of the law!

9
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,963
-Halt!
-How the hell do we stop this thing?

10
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,758
I said, halt!

11
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,261
Here.

12
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,098
Careful, mates. Careful.

13
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,105
There's men inside!

14
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,211
Please.

15
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,745
Bring the scientist with us.
Kill any who resist.

16
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,790
Do we have him?

17
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,002
Draper at your service, sir.

18
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:19,216
The world, Herr Draper.
I want the world.

19
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,642
Really?
That's so frightening.

20
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,519
Don't wander off.

21
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,538
Where's Quatermain?

22
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,417
That gentleman at the back.

23
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:31,849
Do I have the pleasure of addressing
Allan Quatermain?

24
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:36,854
Yes, you do, sir. lndeed you do.

25
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,815
You're not what I expected.

26
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,109
I presume you're another traveler...

27
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,321
...got it in your head
to sample the Dark Continent.

28
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,033
And while you're at it,
hunt down old Allan Quatermain...

29
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,660
...and have him tell his adventures.

30
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,456
-Well--
-You just fill a seat, sir.

31
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:59,251
You can fill my glass.
Bruce, double.

32
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:07,593
I'll regale you with how I found King
Solomon's Mines, or I could relate my--

33
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:11,055
It is not your past that interests me.

34
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,349
My name is Sanderson Reed.

35
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:17,186
I am a representative
of Her Majesty's British government.

36
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,938
The Empire needs you.

37
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,857
But the question is...

38
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,151
...do I need the Empire?

39
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,696
Perhaps I should toddle off.
Should I, Allan?

40
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,949
Yes, of course, Nigel, you toddle off.

41
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,034
Toddling.

42
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:37,498
Nigel is useful for keeping
the story seekers at bay.

43
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,667
I'm Quatermain.

44
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,670
The Empire is in peril.

45
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:49,134
You're probably too young to know,
but the Empire is always in some peril.

46
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:53,222
We need you to lead a team
of unique men like yourself...

47
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,308
...to combat this threat.

48
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,354
Regale me.

49
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:05,567
There is great unrest, countries set at
each other's throats, baying for blood.

50
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,571
The trouble of which I speak could
set a match to the whole thing. War.

51
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,784
-With whom, exactly?
-Everyone.

52
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,869
A world war.

53
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:21,458
-That notion makes you sweat?
-Heavens, man, doesn't it you?

54
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,919
This is Africa, dear boy.

55
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,714
Sweating is what we do.

56
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,967
Where is your sense of patriotism?

57
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,387
God save the queen.

58
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:36,557
-God save the queen. God bless her.
-God save the queen.

59
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,810
That's about as patriotic
as it gets around here.

60
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,271
But you're Allan Quatermain.

61
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:46,692
Stories of your exploits have thrilled
English boys for decades.

62
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:52,865
That I know, and Nigel has done
a grand job reminding me.

63
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:57,995
But with each past exploit...

64
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:01,957
...I've lost friends.
White men and black...

65
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,543
...and much more.

66
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,255
And I am not the man I once was.

67
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,508
The gentleman over there.

68
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,720
-We're in for the long haul.
-Exactly.

69
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,014
-Mr. Quatermain?
-Why, yes indeed, sir.

70
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,855
Wrong Quatermain.

71
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,231
That's him.

72
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,736
Get down!

73
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:35,407
-They're indestructible.
-No, just armor-plated.

74
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,757
Automatic rifles? Who in God's name
has automatic rifles?

75
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:55,094
That's unsporting. Probably Belgium.

76
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,952
Allan!

77
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,760
Wicked waste.

78
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,638
Look out!

79
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,082
Rule, Britannia.

80
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,043
Wasn't there another one
of these buggers?

81
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,253
Mr. Quatermain!

82
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,591
Bruce, Matilda.

83
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:21,388
Our friend might have some information.

84
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:27,019
But he's so far away.

85
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,439
Yes, I thought he was.

86
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,902
God, I hate getting old.

87
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,374
-Did you mean to just wound him?
-Obviously.

88
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,381
Stop him! I need information!

89
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,181
Bloody poison.

90
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:10,812
You may have no love for the Empire,
but I know you love Africa.

91
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,982
A war in Europe will spread
to its colonies.

92
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:28,080
It appears the war has arrived.

93
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,458
Very well, Reed...

94
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,835
...I'm in.

95
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,672
Excellent.

96
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,758
Pack for an English summer.

97
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,823
You made good time getting here.

98
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:49,995
Not as good as Phileas Fogg.
Around the world in 80 days.

99
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,437
Where are we going, Australia?

100
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,698
And here we are, sir.

101
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,678
I don't like theatrics.

102
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:54,601
After Africa's veldts, London's weather
isn't helping your mood, I see.

103
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,853
Identify yourself.

104
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:00,023
I'm known by many names,
Mr. Quatermain.

105
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:04,194
My underlings call me sir.
My superiors call me M.

106
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,405
M?

107
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,740
Just M.

108
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,079
I must say, the delight is mine,
meeting so notable a recruit...

109
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:18,417
...to this newest generation of the
League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.

110
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,709
League of what?

111
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,838
There have been times
when a danger upon the world...

112
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,800
...required the services
of singular individuals.

113
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,969
How very curious.

114
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,931
This museum is full of the curious.

115
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,892
Allan Quatermain, Captain Nemo.

116
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,979
I know of Mr. Quatermain.

117
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,606
And I know of you, captain.

118
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,484
Rumor has it that you're a pirate.

119
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,571
I'd prefer a less provocative title.

120
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,490
-I'm sure you would.
-Gentlemen, please.

121
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,909
Nations are striking at nations.

122
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:56,538
Every attack marked by the use
of highly advanced weaponry.

123
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,583
These attacks
are all the work of one man...

124
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:04,504
-...who calls himself the Fantom.
-Very operatic. What's in it for him?

125
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,964
Profit.

126
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:11,094
Those machines are his creations, the
work of scientists he holds imprisoned.

127
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:14,931
His attacks have nations clamoring
for the weapons that assail them.

128
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:19,102
-Then it's a race for arms.
-And millions will perish.

129
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,441
There's one last chance to avert war.

130
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,986
The leaders of Europe
are to meet secretly in Venice.

131
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:32,532
And you believe that this Fantom
will attack that conference?

132
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,909
If he can find it.

133
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:38,497
We need a team to stop him in Venice.
This team consists of six members.

134
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:42,792
-You'll have four days.
-Four days to get to Venice?

135
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,587
-lt's impossible.
-Let me worry about that.

136
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:51,384
Well now,
extraordinary gentlemen indeed.

137
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,261
One of them is late.

138
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:57,682
-Harker, the chemist.
-Oh, chemist, eh?

139
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,268
Do we get to blow something up then?

140
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,523
My eyesight must be worse
than I thought.

141
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,067
No, your eyesight's fine.

142
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,906
No games, M.

143
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:17,244
Some time ago, a talented,
albeit misguided, man of science...

144
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,746
...discovered the means
to become invisible.

145
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:24,876
-Yes, I recall the tale, but didn't he die?
-Well, he did, but his process didn't.

146
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,797
You see, I stole it,
and here I stand for all to see.

147
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,967
-ls this some parlor game?
-Believe it.

148
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,886
Easy now, Allan.

149
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:39,140
I'm feeling a bit of a draft
in my nether regions.

150
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:43,103
And I must say, it's quite refreshing.

151
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:49,818
Allow me to introduce myself.
Rodney Skinner, gentleman thief.

152
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:55,532
Now, I thought invisibility
would be a boon to my work.

153
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,078
Well, you can imagine,
it was my undoing.

154
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:04,541
Once you're invisible,
it's bloody hard to turn back.

155
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,543
We finally caught him.

156
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:10,672
And they'll provide an antidote.
Well, that's if I'm a good boy.

157
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,424
And are you a good boy?

158
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:17,470
I guess you'll find out, won't you?

159
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,393
Am I late?

160
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,854
A woman's prerogative, Mrs. Harker.

161
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:30,233
Please tell me this is Harker's wife
with a sick note.

162
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:35,238
Sick would be a mild understatement.
My husband's been dead for years.

163
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:38,575
Gentlemen, Mrs. Wilhelmina Harker.

164
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:43,038
Mina's prior acquaintance
with a reluctant League member...

165
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,499
-...may prove useful.
-I'm waiting to be impressed.

166
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:50,837
The fate of the world is at stake.
There are two more members to recruit.

167
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:54,591
-The clock hands turn, gentlemen.
-Kicking us out already?

168
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,886
A moment ago,
it was sherry and giggles.

169
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:14,903
-What in God's name is that?
-l call it an automobile.

170
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,614
Yeah, but what is it?

171
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:20,408
The future, gentlemen.

172
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,244
The future.

173
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:28,416
-This is my first mate.
-Call me Ishmael. Please.

174
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:00,907
So how did M get you?

175
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,742
None of your business.

176
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:07,497
You're a little testy, Mr. Q.

177
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:12,877
Mrs. Harker, I doubt if you measure
danger the way I do.

178
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,673
And I imagine you with quite the library,
Mr. Quatermain.

179
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:20,593
All those books you must have read
merely by looking at their covers.

180
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:25,974
I've had women along on past exploits
and found them to be, at best...

181
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:29,436
-...a distraction.
-Do I distract you?

182
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:34,065
My dear girl, I've buried two wives
and many lovers...

183
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,610
...and I'm in no mood
for more of either.

184
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:42,449
-You can send them my way--
-Skinner, shut up.

185
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:28,578
-Shall I wait, captain?
-No, bring my lady to me.

186
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,625
This is a charming spot.

187
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,503
Does Jack the Ripper live here?

188
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,391
-Good evening.
-Mr. Dorian Gray?

189
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,437
-l am indeed.
-We came by way of M.

190
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,525
M for mystery.

191
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,279
Well, I've told him and I'm telling you,
I'm not interested.

192
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,114
Dorian.

193
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,287
Mina?

194
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,216
Charming décor.

195
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,802
You're missing a picture, Mr. Gray.

196
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,304
And you don't miss a thing,
do you?

197
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,723
Oh, sometimes.

198
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,814
Scotch, anyone?

199
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,566
Please, help yourself.

200
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,610
Don't let it ruin your makeup.

201
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:48,867
I'm impressed, Mr. Gray. You take
Skinner's uniqueness in your stride.

202
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:53,538
Yes, well, I've seen too much
in my life to shock easily.

203
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:58,042
Although, I must say
I was surprised to see you again.

204
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,962
Well, our last parting
was such sweet sorrow.

205
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:05,633
So you're nothing more
than an enticement.

206
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:09,512
Nevertheless,
your presence intrigues me.

207
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:14,183
They say you're indestructible,
Quatermain.

208
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:18,229
Well, a witch doctor
did bless me once.

209
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,899
I had saved his village.

210
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:26,279
He said Africa
would never allow me to die.

211
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,823
But you're not in Africa now.

212
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:30,700
No.

213
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:35,204
I confess a curiosity as to what
the files say about Mr. Gray.

214
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:39,208
We, all of us, have traits useful
in this endeavor.

215
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:44,714
A hunter, scientist,
even Skinner has stealth.

216
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:47,342
-Cheers.
-What of you?

217
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,886
I have experience.

218
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:55,558
Gray and I have met before,
many years ago at Eton College.

219
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,435
A lecture, no doubt.

220
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:01,898
You, the nation's hero,
Dorian, the eager listening boy.

221
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:03,816
Quite the reverse.

222
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:07,153
It was Gray visiting Eton...

223
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,490
...and I was the boy.

224
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:19,040
What is it?

225
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,388
-Gray?
-They are not mine.

226
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,598
They're mine.

227
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:45,566
First meetings usually
warrant introductions.

228
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:50,196
Of course. I am the Fantom.

229
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:57,036
You are the League of so-called
Extraordinary Gentlemen.

230
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,580
Introductions made.

231
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:05,753
Oh, and I'm scarred, Mr. Quatermain,
not blind.

232
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,088
Drop the gun.

233
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:15,304
Your mission is to stop me.
That, of course, I cannot permit.

234
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:19,559
So I give to you all a special
one-time invitation.

235
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,769
Join me.

236
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:25,023
You think we'll help start a war
that will consume the planet?

237
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,526
While you profit
from your arms race?

238
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:33,656
I cannot deny that fortunes
are made in war.

239
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:38,703
Imagine the riches
a world war will yield.

240
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,914
-He's not wrong.
-Speak for yourself.

241
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,652
Draw your pistol!

242
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:55,738
I walk a different path.

243
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,214
Run, James!

244
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,270
Hang on.

245
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,404
Night-night.

246
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,430
Dorian!

247
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,156
What are you?

248
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:22,366
I'm complicated.

249
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:46,098
Damn.

250
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:51,479
I thought I was special.
You're invulnerable to harm.

251
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:54,315
I don't like to boast.
What happened to Mina?

252
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:57,652
Oh, she's probably hip-deep
in some sort of trouble.

253
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:01,072
Don't be such an alarmist, Mr. Q.

254
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,908
And my hips
are none of your business.

255
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,580
Shoot!

256
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,041
Go on!

257
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,675
I guessed as much, that they
would do anything to protect you.

258
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:24,345
See, now that's your biggest mistake.

259
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,723
Thinking that I need them
to protect me.

260
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,410
Extraordinary.

261
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,915
Boy, they told me European women
had funny ways.

262
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,585
You missed a spot.

263
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,215
Excuse me.

264
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,010
And you are?

265
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:07,722
Special Agent Sawyer
of the American Secret Service.

266
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,266
Then America is aware
of the situation?

267
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:14,645
If war starts in Europe, how long
will it take until it crosses the Atlantic?

268
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:19,275
I followed you. I knocked out a straggler,
and I took his place.

269
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:24,488
Very noble. But this is a private party,
and you're not invited.

270
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:28,284
Actually, Dorian has declined...

271
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:30,870
...so we are one shy of a full deck.

272
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:35,416
On the contrary, the battle
was just the spur I needed.

273
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:38,252
That and the thrill
of a friendship renewed.

274
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:43,090
So you're not needed.

275
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:50,598
-Winchester.
-That's right.

276
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:54,268
-lt's modified, American style.
-American-style shooting too.

277
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:57,521
Well, whatever it takes.

278
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:01,692
You like it, I brought two.

279
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:05,863
You're in.

280
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:12,870
-So, what's the next port of call?
-Paris.

281
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,581
Just one last member to recruit.

282
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:19,710
Capture is more the word,
and it will be quite a hunt.

283
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,213
You make him sound like
some kind of animal.

284
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:27,802
Oh, speaking thus, Mrs. Harker,
your conduct a moment ago...?

285
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:33,182
Indeed. We are all aquiver
with curiosity.

286
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,269
Well....

287
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:43,442
My husband was Jonathan Harker.

288
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:47,363
With a professor named Van Helsing,
we fought a dangerous evil.

289
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:53,202
It had a name, Dracula.
He was Transylvanian.

290
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,329
European?

291
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:59,458
One of those radicals the newspapers
love to report on?

292
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:02,169
I don't know, Mr. Skinner.

293
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:10,094
Is the vampiric sucking of people's
blood radical behavior?

294
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,856
Our transportation is forthcoming.

295
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,649
A boat?

296
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:28,070
It travels on water,
if that's what you mean.

297
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:35,494
And beneath it.

298
00:32:54,222 --> 00:33:00,227
Behold Nautilus,
the Sword of the Ocean.

299
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:06,525
Next stop, Paris.

300
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,787
I don't see what we need
a big monkey for.

301
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:22,875
Well, this big monkey has terrorized
the Rue Morgue for months.

302
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:26,921
Imagine the mayhem
he'll give the enemy.

303
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,554
-You missed!
-I'm not trying to hit him.

304
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,433
Turn left, Mr. Hyde.

305
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:49,026
Make him turn left, boy.

306
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:56,534
If you can't do it with one bullet,
don't do it at all.

307
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:00,329
-He's doubled back.
-Precisely. Come on.

308
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,418
Look out!

309
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,381
That was naughty.

310
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:16,053
-Thanks.
-Eyes open, boy.

311
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,806
I can't protect you all the time.

312
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,436
He's afraid.

313
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,189
I can't smell anything.

314
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:01,557
Perfect.

315
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:04,268
Welcome aboard, Mr. Hyde.

316
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:17,281
"This hunt's too dangerous for a woman,
even one such as you. Leave it to me."

317
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:26,081
Good God.

318
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:37,509
Hello, Dorian.

319
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:41,430
The great white hunter's
bagged his prize.

320
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,768
Or the prize bagged him.

321
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,149
Stay back, if you value your life.

322
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:07,331
-You scratched me.
-Better me than him.

323
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,544
Well, this is nice.

324
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,464
Mr. Hyde.

325
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:18,258
You've done terrible things in England.

326
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:23,013
So terrible that you fled the country.

327
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:27,184
Now, I'm ashamed to say that
Her Majesty's government...

328
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:31,438
...is willing to offer you amnesty...

329
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,608
...in return for your services.

330
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,362
Do you want to go home?

331
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,614
Home?

332
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:44,493
"Home's where the heart is,"
that's what they say.

333
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:47,538
And I have been missing London so.

334
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:52,042
Its sorrow is as sweet
to me as a rare wine.

335
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,881
I am yours.

336
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:03,595
Don't be afraid.

337
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:07,057
-Who says I'm afraid?
-You do!

338
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,601
You stink of fear!

339
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,565
Quite the parlor trick.

340
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:18,902
You wait till you see my next one.

341
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,121
Dr. Jekyll...

342
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,207
...at your service.

343
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,922
So...

344
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,466
...the League is set.

345
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,808
So is the date for the conference.

346
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,894
-We have three days.
-Three days?

347
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,897
Can this canoe do that?

348
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:41,902
You underestimate the Nautilus, sir.

349
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:45,239
You underestimate her greatly.

350
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,144
She's out of your league.

351
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,651
Mina?

352
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:28,282
Don't flatter yourself, Dorian.

353
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,704
Fortune rewards the bold.

354
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:41,086
If you require help during the voyage,
Mrs. Harker, just let me know.

355
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:45,591
I'm curious how you think
you'll assist me, Agent Sawyer.

356
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:48,218
Heavy lifting.

357
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,641
Light banter.

358
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:58,186
-I'm a useful kind of guy.
-You're sweet.

359
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,731
And you're young.

360
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:04,234
Neither are traits that I hold
in high regard.

361
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,037
The solar panels are fully charged.
We'll be diving in a moment.

362
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,206
Mr. Quatermain.

363
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:21,043
Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Skinner.

364
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:24,630
-Captain.
-Nemo.

365
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:58,830
The plans the Fantom stole from
the Bank of England. These are copies.

366
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:02,250
Da Vinci's blueprints of Venice.

367
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,547
Its foundations...

368
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,925
...and waterways.

369
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,680
So he'll attack the conference by sea.

370
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:34,408
Easy, Allan, easy.

371
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:39,329
Skinner! I want you dressed
at all times!

372
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,583
Or it's my boot up your ass!

373
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:53,760
Dinner is served, Mr. Quatermain.

374
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,179
I can offer you a jacket,
if you require.

375
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,140
Oh, thank you, no.

376
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:03,228
But thank you for your
contributions so far.

377
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:09,568
I may have been overly rude earlier...

378
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:11,903
...when I called you a pirate.

379
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:16,658
And I may have been overly charitable
when I said I wasn't.

380
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:19,202
But I try to live in the now...

381
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:23,415
...where the ghosts of old wrongs
do not abide. What of you?

382
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:26,710
I don't believe in ghosts,
although I've seen my share.

383
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:29,463
Your past haunts you.

384
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:36,553
Vanity, pride...

385
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:42,893
...mistakes that cost me someone dear.

386
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:46,730
So now you throw yourself
in harm's way?

387
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:51,401
Old tigers, sensing the end,
they're at their most fierce.

388
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:54,905
And they go down fighting.

389
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,472
They're not how I left them, captain.

390
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,934
That's all I'm saying.

391
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:29,231
Powder?

392
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:32,609
You think sabotage?

393
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:35,195
We ain't that far off course.

394
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:57,008
Did you want something?

395
00:43:57,176 --> 00:44:00,762
No, I was just wondering why
you signed up for all this.

396
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,725
Nemo told me you hate
the British Empire.

397
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,853
They called, and I answered.

398
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:11,022
Yeah, well that ain't all of it,
though, is it?

399
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:18,947
Sorry I asked.

400
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,667
A few years ago...

401
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:35,005
...the British approached me with
a mission for queen and country.

402
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:38,049
That sounds like the morning ride
to work for you.

403
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:41,386
I signed on without hesitation.

404
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:43,889
I even took my son along.

405
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:49,269
I led and my son followed.

406
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:52,939
He died in my arms.

407
00:44:56,485 --> 00:45:01,740
After that, I washed my hands
of England and the Empire and...

408
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:07,954
...the legend of
Allan-bloody-Quatermain.

409
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,798
Now...

410
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:21,843
...would you like to learn how to shoot?

411
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:27,015
-l can already.
-l saw, it was very American.

412
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:31,144
Fire enough bullets and hope
to hit the target.

413
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:35,899
Sawyer, I'm talking about
pipping the ace...

414
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:38,568
...at 900 yards.

415
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,322
Try.

416
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:48,370
Easy, easy.

417
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:58,588
-Aim.
-That's easy.

418
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,715
Allow for wind, target movement.

419
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:04,386
-Yeah, that's easy too.
-This is the part that's not.

420
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,180
You have to feel the shot.

421
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,808
Take your time with it.

422
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,310
You have all the time you need.

423
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,147
All the time in the world.

424
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:19,484
Take your....

425
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,405
Too soon.

426
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:27,826
But that was bloody close.
And at 500 yards too.

427
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:29,536
Again.

428
00:46:38,421 --> 00:46:41,298
Did you teach your son
to shoot like this?

429
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:47,971
Quatermain?

430
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:31,681
That's Kali.

431
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:34,768
Goddess of death.

432
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:39,439
Nemo worships death,
can we trust him?

433
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,277
He's not the one I'm worried about.

434
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,551
Mina.

435
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:13,264
I'm identifying a powder
that Nemo found.

436
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:17,685
Magnesium phosphorus.

437
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,855
Photographers use it to create a flash.

438
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,399
A camera, perhaps?

439
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:26,444
It appears that someone wishes
to capture this vessel's secrets.

440
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:37,414
I was surprised you ultimately
joined the League.

441
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:44,212
I mean to undo the flaws
in my character.

442
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,714
I want to face my demons.

443
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,300
And what do you know of demons?

444
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:58,309
Do you recall a space
on the wall of my home?

445
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,146
A picture was missing.

446
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:04,858
Although the picture is my portrait...

447
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:09,237
...l doubt you'd recognize
the face upon it.

448
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:14,200
Every year that passes,
my portrait ages...

449
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,494
...instead of me.

450
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:20,290
When did you last see it?

451
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:25,336
I dare not look upon it myself...

452
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:28,965
...or the magic of the painting
would be undone.

453
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:40,810
Nightcap?

454
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,938
I'm not much of a drinker.

455
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:58,620
Just a small one then.

456
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,504
How clumsy of me.

457
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,923
We don't want blood everywhere.

458
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:13,301
-Do we?
-No.

459
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:15,303
Not blood.

460
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:25,563
<i>Yes, Henry. Look, but don't touch.</i>

461
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,691
<i>That's your way.</i>

462
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,028
Just shut up.

463
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:34,280
-l won't be tricked again.
<i>-Tricked?</i>

464
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:37,784
<i>You've known what I was about</i>
<i>each time you drank the formula.</i>

465
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:40,078
Liar! I'm a good man, a good man!

466
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,830
<i>Well, who's lying now?</i>
<i>You want it!</i>

467
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,834
<i>Even more than you want her.</i>
<i>You can't shut me out forever!</i>

468
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:48,503
<i>-Drink the elixir!</i>
-No!

469
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:50,964
<i>-She barely even looks at you!</i>
-Be quiet!

470
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,509
She looked at me!

471
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:59,681
Contain your evil, doctor!

472
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:04,394
I'll not have the brute free
upon my ship.

473
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,229
Must I take drastic steps?

474
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:09,774
-l am in control.
-l very much doubt it.

475
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:15,029
Your talk is all well and good, sir,
but your own past is far from laudable.

476
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,008
<i>Let me out.</i>

477
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:43,141
If I didn't know better,
I'd swear I already had.

478
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:46,978
One of the vials is missing.

479
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,981
Oh, God.

480
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:56,487
So it's clear. With da Vinci's blueprints
and enough explosives...

481
00:51:56,655 --> 00:52:00,700
...he could set a bomb that would
blow Venice's foundations to rubble.

482
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:05,830
-He's gonna sink the whole city.
-Yes, and spark off his world war.

483
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:09,709
I'm afraid that's not the sum
of our problems.

484
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:16,591
Skinner, he's taken a vial
of my formula.

485
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,969
-Are you sure?
-Who else?

486
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:23,389
You've seen the way
the sneaky blackguard operates.

487
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:12,939
It's the carnival.

488
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:15,650
My God, we must locate that bomb.

489
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,422
We can go no further, captain.

490
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,048
All ahead, stop.

491
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:48,785
Deploy the divers beneath the city.

492
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:52,163
-The explosives must be found.
-Aye, aye, sir.

493
00:54:52,331 --> 00:54:55,333
The city is vast. It could be anywhere.

494
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:59,003
-What about Skinner?
-I'd be alert for his treachery.

495
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,184
Bloody carnival.

496
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,937
God, I feared the worst.

497
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,855
It's all right. We still have--

498
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:33,079
-The buildings are falling like dominoes!
-We're too late!

499
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,916
There must be more than one bomb.

500
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,252
Nemo!

501
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:43,548
The bombs are at the city's center.
We must take out one key building.

502
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:47,134
-Get ahead and destroy the next building!
-lnterrupt the chain!

503
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:51,806
With a beacon at the coordinates, I could
launch a rocket and take out the domino.

504
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:54,976
That's ridiculous!
We'd never get there in time.

505
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:58,896
-No room for error, but it could work.
-What are you talking about?

506
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:03,484
I'm an immortal, sir, not a gazelle.
How can we outrun this?

507
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:12,577
Care for a spin?

508
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:17,623
Come on, Jekyll, get in!

509
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,126
-I'll need coordinates.
-Can you track this?

510
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:22,295
-Of course.
-Then this is the target.

511
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,505
-Launch when you see the flare.
-Right.

512
00:56:24,673 --> 00:56:28,217
-Jekyll, come on, we'll need Hyde.
-No!

513
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:30,887
Hyde will never use me again.

514
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,347
Then what good are you?

515
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:48,487
Straight ahead, then turn left.

516
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:51,073
No, no, take a right
after the canal ports.

517
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,868
We must turn left to get ahead of the--

518
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:57,580
Snipers!

519
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:01,918
Damn Skinner, he must have
told them we were coming.

520
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,894
Dorian!

521
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:27,109
-Can't get a clear shot!
-Then take the wheel!

522
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,071
Sawyer!

523
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:38,454
Sit down, you buffoon. I don't know
how to drive this bloody thing!

524
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:41,207
Get down!

525
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:43,626
Got it!

526
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:47,338
Save your bullets. These men are mine!

527
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:51,509
Did you see that?

528
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:57,306
-Did you see what she just did?
-Keep your eyes on the road!

529
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:08,025
It's a gauntlet!

530
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:11,779
The vampire lady has us covered!

531
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:46,939
The collapse has reached the carnival.
Time's running out.

532
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:49,275
Tune the tracer to the car's frequency.

533
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:52,445
-The rocket must be ready to launch.
-Aye, aye, captain.

534
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:13,299
Come on, Sawyer, come on!

535
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:16,510
-Captain, we must pull out!
-No, we stay and do our job!

536
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:26,437
Remember the flare. I'm off!

537
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:30,566
-What?
-Don't forget, you're the target.

538
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:57,259
-We'll be smashed apart!
-Nemo says we stay, we stay.

539
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:08,145
He's overtaken the collapse!
Be ready to launch!

540
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,245
Launch!

541
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:38,217
Bravo, boy.

542
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:04,743
He's done it.

543
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:30,853
Venice still stands.

544
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:39,069
You've failed.

545
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:48,704
You see yourself as the brave
John Bull.

546
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:53,500
But you're weak.

547
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:58,797
You run from the memory
of your son's death.

548
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:02,635
You should have trained him
a little better.

549
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:10,559
You may as well have put the gun to
his head and pulled the trigger yourself.

550
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:16,899
Oh, yes, I know all about you.

551
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:22,404
I know all about your spy.

552
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,531
Do you?

553
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:31,455
Mr. Gray? What happened?

554
01:02:31,623 --> 01:02:34,250
Misadventure. Have the others returned?

555
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:37,753
You're the first, hopefully not the last.

556
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:41,674
That bastard, Skinner.
A lot to answer for.

557
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:44,635
Skinner? No.

558
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:46,720
Me.

559
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:07,866
You?

560
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:11,578
You don't know the half of it.

561
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:28,637
The Fantom is M.

562
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,099
And the hunt is still on.

563
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:34,893
-What are you talking about?
-The Fantom is M...

564
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,563
-...the man who recruited us.
-Let me see that.

565
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:40,649
-But how?
-We'll get our answers.

566
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:43,944
-Where are the others?
-Dorian's missing in action.

567
01:03:44,696 --> 01:03:49,700
And Mr. Skinner must have fled
when he realized we knew.

568
01:03:51,453 --> 01:03:53,162
And Sawyer?

569
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:56,248
He'll live to fight another day.

570
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:06,425
Don't worry, I've had my fill of throats
for this evening.

571
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:11,388
Captain!

572
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:21,982
It was Gray...

573
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:23,942
...not Skinner.

574
01:04:26,321 --> 01:04:29,114
Gray has tricked us all.

575
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:42,920
What is it?

576
01:04:43,088 --> 01:04:45,547
The sound of treachery!

577
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,231
What is that thing?

578
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,983
My exploration pod.

579
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:27,172
-We could track it.
-l intend to catch it!

580
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:08,589
That is us.

581
01:06:08,756 --> 01:06:10,757
That is the Nautiloid.

582
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,302
We will be upon them soon.

583
01:06:14,012 --> 01:06:16,346
You okay?

584
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:19,433
Just a little shaken.

585
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,653
Nemo?

586
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:34,198
It's nothing of mine.

587
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:40,621
Captain, the noise came from this.

588
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:42,789
A recording disk?

589
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:53,592
<i>Ready, professor?</i>

590
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:56,762
<i>Recording.</i>

591
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:01,850
<i>Gentlemen, if you're hearing this...</i>

592
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:05,020
<i>...then every step leading up to it</i>
<i>has gone as planned.</i>

593
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:07,648
<i>And I have been true</i>
<i>to the goals set to me.</i>

594
01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:09,399
<i>Yes, it's me, Dorian.</i>

595
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:12,736
<i>As you know by now,</i>
<i>I'm no loyal son of the Empire.</i>

596
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:16,448
<i>My loyalty to Mr. M comes</i>
<i>in no small part from his possession...</i>

597
01:07:16,616 --> 01:07:19,701
<i>...of something I hold very dear</i>
<i>to my heart...</i>

598
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:22,329
<i>...something I would do anything</i>
<i>to regain.</i>

599
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:25,082
-Are you all right?
-My ears hurt. It's nothing.

600
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:27,876
<i>Everything so far</i>
<i>has been misdirection.</i>

601
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:30,879
<i>Sanderson Reed,</i>
<i>the assassins in Kenya...</i>

602
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:34,883
<i>...your recruitment and mission,</i>
<i>the secret conference, a myth.</i>

603
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:39,012
<i>Even the League itself. There is</i>
<i>no League. There never was.</i>

604
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,807
<i>It was a ruse to get me closer</i>
<i>to my goals.</i>

605
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:44,017
He likes the sound of his own voice.

606
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:47,688
<i>You see, I want you, each of you,</i>
<i>even tired old Quatermain.</i>

607
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:50,440
<i>He'll capture Hyde</i>
<i>where all others have failed.</i>

608
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:53,527
<i>The question is why.</i>
<i>Why all this mask and mystery?</i>

609
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:58,323
<i>Because in the war to come, I intend</i>
<i>to wield the greatest weapon of all:</i>

610
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:00,701
<i>The power of the League itself.</i>

611
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:04,538
Turn it off, Henry.
Please, turn it off.

612
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:08,834
<i>To that end, I set my wolf</i>
<i>among you sheep...</i>

613
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:10,252
<i>Growl.</i>

614
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:13,255
<i>...who'll gain your trust,</i>
<i>quietly lead you astray.</i>

615
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:17,175
<i>And all the while, I'll collect you,</i>
<i>the parts of you I need.</i>

616
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:19,219
<i>Nemo's science.</i>

617
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:20,721
Magnesium phosphorus.

618
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,015
<i>Skinner's skin sample.</i>

619
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:25,642
You scratched me.

620
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:28,103
<i>Jekyll's potion.</i>

621
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:32,441
<i>And Mina's blood.</i>

622
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:37,863
He's stolen us, and we let him.

623
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:41,366
<i>If you fail to save Venice,</i>
<i>then I get my war.</i>

624
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,243
<i>And if you succeed...</i>

625
01:08:43,411 --> 01:08:47,122
<i>...well, it's a small price to pay</i>
<i>for Gray to go about his task.</i>

626
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:50,125
<i>War will come, sooner or later...</i>

627
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:52,628
<i>...as inevitable as summer into autumn.</i>

628
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:56,381
<i>Now, some of you, perhaps Quatermain</i>
<i>if he isn't dead...</i>

629
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:59,551
<i>...will pause to ask why I'm letting</i>
<i>you know all this.</i>

630
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:02,721
<i>What fool reveals his stratagem</i>
<i>before the game is over?</i>

631
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:07,225
<i>It is over, for you...</i>

632
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:10,312
<i>...because my voice isn't</i>
<i>the only sound being made.</i>

633
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:15,567
<i>While I've rambled on, a secondary layer</i>
<i>of inaudible sound...</i>

634
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:19,863
<i>...higher than humans can hear,</i>
<i>audible to dogs and lower animals...</i>

635
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:25,494
<i>...has been heard by crystal sensors</i>
<i>dotted about your vessel.</i>

636
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:28,872
<i>Sensors attached to bombs.</i>

637
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:32,417
<i>"Bomb" voyage.</i>

638
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:20,674
Out of the way!

639
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:23,260
We have to surface!

640
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:26,346
We're taking in water!
Controls are not responding!

641
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:30,517
Primary engine room almost full!
Aft bulkhead open. Pump valves jammed!

642
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:32,728
-Seal it off!
-There are men in there!

643
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:36,565
For the greater good, we must seal it!

644
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:48,994
<i>We can do it, Henry.</i>

645
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:50,787
What are you talking about?

646
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:54,541
<i>You know we can do it, together!</i>

647
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:06,928
Seal it! Seal it up!

648
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:09,347
Wait!

649
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:12,100
Don't close it!

650
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:14,936
-What are you doing?
-lt's our last chance.

651
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,147
But I'm ordered to close it!

652
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:19,065
Then close it.

653
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:22,277
Seal it up.

654
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:40,313
<i>Bravo, Edward. Bravo!</i>

655
01:13:12,138 --> 01:13:16,433
Let's not make a saint out of a sinner.
Next time, he may not be so helpful.

656
01:13:16,601 --> 01:13:19,644
Can we still follow Gray?

657
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:24,900
Well, we were the faster,
but now we're the tortoise to his hare.

658
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:28,528
-So we're done?
-No, we're alive.

659
01:13:28,696 --> 01:13:32,574
If M has any ideas to the contrary,
that gives us an edge.

660
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:35,619
We're getting a signal.

661
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:39,581
Morse code.

662
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:42,250
-What's it say?
-"Hello, my freaky darlings."

663
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:43,668
Skinner?

664
01:13:43,878 --> 01:13:48,256
"Hiding onboard little fish
with Gray and M.

665
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:54,346
On way to base, east by northeast.
Follow my lead."

666
01:14:48,693 --> 01:14:50,777
Good work...

667
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:52,696
...all of you.

668
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:55,031
Captain?

669
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:57,575
All ahead, full!

670
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:15,301
<i>If Skinner's headings are correct...</i>

671
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:19,055
<i>...we will pass through</i>
<i>the treacherous Straits of Tartary...</i>

672
01:15:19,223 --> 01:15:21,975
<i>...and enter the Amur River,</i>
<i>which empties out...</i>

673
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:28,732
<i>...into the frozen lakes of Mongolia,</i>
<i>virtually inaccessible to outsiders.</i>

674
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,555
Peasant settlements.

675
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:02,432
They're all deserted.

676
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,018
Why deserted?

677
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:10,231
Fear, no doubt.

678
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:42,388
M's summer retreat.

679
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:45,308
This is where Skinner signaled
he'd meet us.

680
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:47,268
So we wait.

681
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,671
Skinner?

682
01:17:54,712 --> 01:17:58,173
-We heard a noise.
-lt was nothing.

683
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:09,267
Just an old tiger sensing his end.

684
01:18:09,476 --> 01:18:13,771
Perhaps this was not his time
to die after all.

685
01:18:18,569 --> 01:18:22,155
-I've been waiting all week to do that.
-Get a grip, man.

686
01:18:22,323 --> 01:18:24,741
Well, I thought I just did.

687
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:27,702
Mina.

688
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:30,914
-Report!
-Well, hello to you too.

689
01:18:31,081 --> 01:18:34,459
And need I remind you,
I am naked in the snow.

690
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:39,964
I can't feel any of my extremities,
and I mean any of them.

691
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:46,888
With all the suspicion on the ship...

692
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:49,807
...l knew you wouldn't believe
I wasn't the spy.

693
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:52,810
I thought it was best to disappear.

694
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:54,896
So, what are we dealing with?

695
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:57,148
The fortress is vast.

696
01:18:57,316 --> 01:19:02,153
<i>Furnaces produce iron for making</i>
<i>M's weapons of destruction.</i>

697
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:16,167
<i>They're pieced together on the factory</i>
<i>floor by a private army of ruthless men...</i>

698
01:19:16,335 --> 01:19:18,544
<i>...who share his vision.</i>

699
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:23,841
<i>But the worst was to come.</i>

700
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:30,723
<i>In the dry dock, M's best minds</i>
<i>pervert Nemo's dream.</i>

701
01:19:32,643 --> 01:19:35,937
<i>-The Nautilus ?</i>
-<i>Nautili</i>. There's eight, for now.

702
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:39,941
-What about the kidnapped scientists?
-M holds their families hostage.

703
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:44,070
The men work,
or the women and children die.

704
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:47,532
-Monstrous!
-That isn't the half of it.

705
01:19:47,825 --> 01:19:51,911
The scientists are forced to work night
and day to make new versions of us.

706
01:19:52,746 --> 01:19:56,749
<i>Invisible spies, an army of Hydes,</i>
<i>vampiric assassins.</i>

707
01:19:56,959 --> 01:20:00,253
<i>M leaves for Europe today</i>
<i>with a sample of the chemicals...</i>

708
01:20:00,421 --> 01:20:03,047
<i>...to sell to the most eager nation.</i>

709
01:20:03,674 --> 01:20:08,094
-I'll not let my evil infect the world.
-Do you think any of us feel differently?

710
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:10,179
Chimney pipes laced to buildings...

711
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:13,516
...and bombs in the furnaces
would make quite a bang.

712
01:20:13,684 --> 01:20:18,646
But someone needs to blow that place
to hell, and I am least likely to be seen.

713
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:23,443
Skinner, I didn't know that you were
such a bare-faced liar.

714
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:27,071
All that time pretending
that you weren't a hero?

715
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:29,699
Shut up, or I'll come to my senses.

716
01:20:29,867 --> 01:20:35,246
And besides, any more like me,
and I'll lose the franchise.

717
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:41,794
No, this cannot be a hunt
to the death, more's the pity.

718
01:20:42,004 --> 01:20:46,132
We must take M alive
if his secrets are to be uncovered.

719
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:48,259
Not Gray.

720
01:20:48,427 --> 01:20:50,219
He's lived long enough.

721
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:53,639
-Oh, I'll handle him.
-No.

722
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:57,935
Nemo, you and Hyde
will free the prisoners.

723
01:20:58,103 --> 01:21:00,938
Sawyer and I will deal with M.

724
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:03,691
Then the game is on.

725
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:08,446
Do you mind?

726
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:12,617
Night-night.

727
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:23,378
Your painting's in your room.

728
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:28,883
In return for the League, that was our
deal, and I'm glad to see you honor it.

729
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:30,343
So, what now?

730
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:35,681
London. I've had my fill of violence.
Now I'm in the mood for vice.

731
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:39,477
You could stay, share my dream.

732
01:21:42,106 --> 01:21:46,317
I've lived long enough to see the future
become history, professor.

733
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:51,155
Empires crumble.
There are no exceptions.

734
01:21:51,365 --> 01:21:53,825
You think you're better than me.

735
01:21:53,992 --> 01:21:59,664
You forget, I've seen your painting.

736
01:22:57,598 --> 01:23:00,141
Skinner said turn right at the column.

737
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:02,226
Oh, great. Which one?

738
01:23:03,854 --> 01:23:05,938
This way.

739
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:11,569
You lead, and I'll follow.

740
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,115
The scientists.

741
01:23:16,283 --> 01:23:18,701
They're for Nemo.

742
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:37,178
<i>Prepare the armaments for shipment.</i>
<i>Prepare the armaments for shipment.</i>

743
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:39,138
They're moving out.

744
01:23:39,306 --> 01:23:41,557
Let's hope Skinner's up to the task.

745
01:23:41,725 --> 01:23:43,267
You, help him out!

746
01:24:11,088 --> 01:24:13,464
Release them!

747
01:24:13,632 --> 01:24:15,091
Quietly!

748
01:24:16,009 --> 01:24:18,386
Get them back to the ship.

749
01:24:58,051 --> 01:25:00,553
Intruders! lntruders!

750
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:02,805
Intruders!

751
01:25:21,033 --> 01:25:25,661
James, here's your box of tricks!

752
01:25:28,081 --> 01:25:30,916
The brute's potion,
the vampire's blood...

753
01:25:31,084 --> 01:25:35,921
...the lndian's science
and mounted samples of invisible skin.

754
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:38,132
They'll be all the rage in Europe.

755
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:40,551
The Nautiloid is fueled and ready.

756
01:25:43,096 --> 01:25:47,600
-We have trouble.
-Trouble? I call it sport.

757
01:25:47,809 --> 01:25:52,563
Intruders! lndians! I think it's
Captain Nemo and his men!

758
01:25:52,773 --> 01:25:54,482
The prisoners are escaping!

759
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:57,610
How many times do I have
to kill these cretins?

760
01:25:57,778 --> 01:25:59,987
-Make this the last.
-Damn them.

761
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:27,014
Nemo, get the scientists!

762
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:30,351
Is that all you've got?

763
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:59,839
Do not move, M.

764
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:06,929
Or would you prefer
Professor James Moriarty?

765
01:27:07,848 --> 01:27:11,559
James Moriarty,
the so-called Napoleon of crime?

766
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:17,440
That man died at Reichenbach Falls.
He died, and I was reborn.

767
01:27:20,986 --> 01:27:22,987
Watch out!

768
01:27:23,530 --> 01:27:26,407
Eyes open, boy.
Can't protect you all of the time.

769
01:27:43,717 --> 01:27:46,343
Hello, lover.

770
01:27:53,643 --> 01:27:55,186
Mina.

771
01:27:58,440 --> 01:27:59,732
You're alive.

772
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:02,902
It's possible I can't die.

773
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:08,449
The same could be said of you.

774
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:13,037
Let's put it to the test.

775
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:21,504
-Minx.
-Do you realize what you've done?

776
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:23,506
What you've let out of me?

777
01:28:23,673 --> 01:28:26,175
A woman's wrath. Oh, I'm petrified!

778
01:28:34,935 --> 01:28:36,894
We'll be at this all day.

779
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:54,995
The bedroom, Mina, does it give
you memories or ideas?

780
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:56,413
Ideas.

781
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:03,087
If that had been permanent,
I'd have been very upset.

782
01:29:03,922 --> 01:29:06,131
Your painting.

783
01:29:12,472 --> 01:29:15,808
I hoped I'd get to nail you
one more time.

784
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:18,811
I didn't think it'd be literally.

785
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:36,328
Skinner?

786
01:29:38,123 --> 01:29:41,542
It's okay. It's Skinner.
What the hell are you doing here?

787
01:29:41,751 --> 01:29:43,836
What makes you think I'm Skinner?

788
01:30:50,654 --> 01:30:51,987
Sawyer!

789
01:30:52,155 --> 01:30:54,156
Run for it!

790
01:31:02,874 --> 01:31:04,208
Keep moving!

791
01:31:04,417 --> 01:31:06,961
Go over! Go, quickly!

792
01:31:20,392 --> 01:31:23,268
Come on! You want more?

793
01:31:25,563 --> 01:31:27,606
No!

794
01:31:30,110 --> 01:31:32,903
Not the whole thing.

795
01:31:52,716 --> 01:31:55,426
You are so lovely.

796
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:09,606
Thank you.

797
01:32:12,027 --> 01:32:14,778
You broke my heart once.

798
01:32:14,946 --> 01:32:17,656
This time you missed.

799
01:32:17,824 --> 01:32:21,702
You spoke once of wanting
to meet your demon.

800
01:32:29,961 --> 01:32:33,505
Here he is.

801
01:32:56,738 --> 01:32:58,947
Skinner?

802
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:05,204
That's the last time I play
with matches.

803
01:33:29,729 --> 01:33:31,230
End of the line, Moriarty.

804
01:33:40,657 --> 01:33:41,657
To the death...

805
01:33:42,575 --> 01:33:45,994
-...but you'll need Hyde to make it mine.
-He'll be making his own fun.

806
01:33:51,084 --> 01:33:53,085
Nemo!

807
01:33:56,923 --> 01:33:59,007
Here!

808
01:33:59,843 --> 01:34:02,136
Nemo!

809
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:12,646
Nemo, run!

810
01:34:31,958 --> 01:34:33,667
What is that thing?

811
01:34:33,835 --> 01:34:36,753
It's me on a bad day.

812
01:35:27,597 --> 01:35:30,307
He's too strong. We're trapped.

813
01:35:30,475 --> 01:35:34,102
No, he's burning through the formula
at an accelerated rate.

814
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:40,609
He'll soon change back.

815
01:35:41,653 --> 01:35:43,528
Nemo!

816
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:02,547
I hope I've got your fire
when I'm your age.

817
01:36:03,174 --> 01:36:06,510
You will not live beyond today.
That I promise you.

818
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:25,988
Hyde. Come on.

819
01:36:26,155 --> 01:36:28,407
My formula's done.

820
01:36:48,678 --> 01:36:50,387
Watch out!

821
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:59,021
Think you'll come in here
and wreck this? I'll rebuild it.

822
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:11,533
There'll be others like me,
Quatermain.

823
01:37:11,743 --> 01:37:14,494
You can't kill the future.

824
01:38:11,052 --> 01:38:13,345
Do you ever get tired of being wrong?

825
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:17,557
The League, me, Skinner.

826
01:38:18,267 --> 01:38:19,518
Wrong.

827
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:22,771
Wrong about your little
American friend as well.

828
01:38:22,939 --> 01:38:25,190
Do you really think
he's ready for action?

829
01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:29,319
I think you've trained him about as well
as you trained your son.

830
01:39:04,313 --> 01:39:06,064
Get him.

831
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:13,905
-lt's too far.
-Take your time.

832
01:39:14,198 --> 01:39:16,324
You're ready.

833
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:25,333
Take your time.

834
01:39:58,326 --> 01:39:59,951
I got him.

835
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:07,834
May this new century be yours, son...

836
01:40:09,337 --> 01:40:12,214
...as the old one was mine.

837
01:41:01,389 --> 01:41:05,308
You remember he swore Africa
wouldn't let him die?

838
01:41:05,726 --> 01:41:08,144
I wish the old boy had been right.

839
01:41:12,441 --> 01:41:14,526
What's next?

840
01:41:14,735 --> 01:41:16,820
I have long hidden away
from the world.

841
01:41:16,988 --> 01:41:22,325
Now I wish to see it anew
as the century turns.

842
01:41:22,535 --> 01:41:24,744
You're all welcome to join me.

843
01:41:25,454 --> 01:41:28,582
We've all been hiding
in one form or another.

844
01:41:30,835 --> 01:41:33,003
The <i>Nautilus</i> awaits.

845
01:41:33,462 --> 01:41:35,714
So who's coming?

846
01:41:38,926 --> 01:41:41,636
So long, old chap.

847
01:41:41,804 --> 01:41:43,930
Goodbye, Allan.

848
01:41:50,730 --> 01:41:52,814
Goodbye.

849
01:41:55,735 --> 01:41:57,569
Thanks.

850
01:50:04,681 --> 01:50:05,681
