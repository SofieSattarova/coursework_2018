1
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,297
<i>Unit Christmas rations
must be picked up by 0900 hours.</i>

2
00:01:17,331 --> 00:01:22,462
<i>Armor group tree decoration team,
report to the Engineering Depot.</i>

3
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:30,639
My son, will you turn off
that wretched puppet?

4
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:33,614
Brush your teeth.

5
00:01:33,681 --> 00:01:36,344
Don't call him a puppet.

6
00:01:36,418 --> 00:01:37,885
I beg your pardon.

7
00:01:37,953 --> 00:01:40,581
Look, he's not a puppet.

8
00:01:40,656 --> 00:01:41,884
Howdy Doody's real.

9
00:01:41,956 --> 00:01:43,117
- Well...
- He's real.

10
00:01:43,192 --> 00:01:45,717
Mr. Deedee Doodoo will
have to say good night.

11
00:01:45,794 --> 00:01:47,557
Oh, no.

12
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:50,155
And remember,
you have to be asleep

13
00:01:50,233 --> 00:01:52,723
when he comes
down the chimney.

14
00:01:53,769 --> 00:01:55,669
It's not even a chimney, Pop.

15
00:01:56,673 --> 00:01:57,970
He has his ways.

16
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,371
Then I want to wait up.
Watch him do it.

17
00:01:59,441 --> 00:02:00,499
Nonsense.

18
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,341
Okay.
I want a story then.

19
00:02:03,413 --> 00:02:04,778
Oh, no, no, no.
No stories tonight.

20
00:02:04,848 --> 00:02:06,941
Just one.
And then I'll go to bed.

21
00:02:07,016 --> 00:02:08,448
Right away.

22
00:02:08,517 --> 00:02:11,248
Then I'll brush my teeth,
I promise.

23
00:02:20,864 --> 00:02:24,800
<i>It is said that
at the dawn of time,</i>

24
00:02:24,868 --> 00:02:31,775
<i>man, beast and all magical beings lived
together under Aiglin the Father Tree.</i>

25
00:02:32,543 --> 00:02:36,478
<i>But man had been created
with a hole in his heart,</i>

26
00:02:36,546 --> 00:02:42,041
<i>a hole that no possession,
power or knowledge could fill.</i>

27
00:02:42,118 --> 00:02:44,349
<i>And in his infinite greed,</i>

28
00:02:44,421 --> 00:02:49,585
<i>man dreamt of expanding his
dominion over the entire Earth.</i>

29
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:08,042
<i>The blood of many an elf,
ogre and goblin</i>

30
00:03:08,112 --> 00:03:10,842
<i>was spilled in
their war with man.</i>

31
00:03:10,915 --> 00:03:14,317
<i>And King Balor, the
one-armed king of Elfland,</i>

32
00:03:14,386 --> 00:03:18,117
<i>watched the slaughter
in dread and despair.</i>

33
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:23,094
<i>But one day, the master
of the goblin blacksmiths</i>

34
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:27,257
<i>offered to build the king
a golden mechanical army,</i>

35
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,698
<i>seventy times 70 soldiers</i>

36
00:03:29,768 --> 00:03:33,704
<i>that would never know hunger
and could not be stopped.</i>

37
00:03:33,772 --> 00:03:36,707
<i>Prince Nuada begged
his father to agree.</i>

38
00:03:37,876 --> 00:03:40,401
<i>Build me this army,
the king said.</i>

39
00:03:50,722 --> 00:03:53,715
<i>So a magical crown
was forged</i>

40
00:03:53,793 --> 00:03:56,023
<i>that would allow
those of royal blood</i>

41
00:03:56,095 --> 00:03:58,928
<i>to command the Golden Army
if unchallenged.</i>

42
00:03:58,998 --> 00:04:03,128
<i>I am King Balor,
leader of the Golden Army.</i>

43
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:05,762
<i>Is there anyone
who disputes my right?</i>

44
00:04:05,838 --> 00:04:09,638
<i>And in his throne room
no one challenged his word.</i>

45
00:04:10,576 --> 00:04:13,740
But, wait, what if someone
could challenge him?

46
00:04:13,814 --> 00:04:14,871
Would they have a fight?

47
00:04:14,947 --> 00:04:16,209
Well, most likely.

48
00:04:16,282 --> 00:04:17,476
A challenge must
be answered.

49
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,644
But do you want to hear
the end of this story or not?

50
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,812
Yes, please.

51
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:21,945
Right.

52
00:04:22,022 --> 00:04:27,153
<i>So the world was changed, and
the next time the humans marched,</i>

53
00:04:27,227 --> 00:04:30,855
<i>they felt the earth
tremble beneath their feet</i>

54
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:35,425
<i>and saw the sky darken
with monstrous shapes.</i>

55
00:04:40,607 --> 00:04:47,275
<i>The Golden Army had no
remorse, felt no loyalty or pain.</i>

56
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:54,486
<i>And King Balor's heart
grew heavy with regret.</i>

57
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:59,821
<i>So he called a truce and
divided the crown in three pieces,</i>

58
00:04:59,893 --> 00:05:03,557
<i>one for the humans,
and two for himself.</i>

59
00:05:03,631 --> 00:05:06,896
<i>In exchange, man
would keep to the cities</i>

60
00:05:06,968 --> 00:05:09,960
<i>and the magical beings
would own the forests.</i>

61
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:14,304
<i>This truce would be honored by
their sons and the sons of their sons</i>

62
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,172
<i>until the end of time.</i>

63
00:05:17,412 --> 00:05:21,315
<i>But Prince Nuada did not
believe in the promises of man.</i>

64
00:05:21,383 --> 00:05:24,351
<i>And it is said that
he went into exile,</i>

65
00:05:24,452 --> 00:05:28,617
<i>vowing to return the day
his people needed him most.</i>

66
00:05:29,224 --> 00:05:32,818
<i>So the Golden
Army lay dormant,</i>

67
00:05:32,894 --> 00:05:36,422
<i>locked inside the Earth,
waiting.</i>

68
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,167
<i>And there it is to this day,</i>

69
00:05:41,236 --> 00:05:45,036
<i>awaiting the day the crown
is made whole again.</i>

70
00:05:45,107 --> 00:05:50,704
<i>Silent,
still and indestructible.</i>

71
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:54,408
Wow. What does it
mean "industrable"?

72
00:05:54,484 --> 00:05:55,711
Indestructible.

73
00:05:55,784 --> 00:05:56,944
Indestruct...

74
00:05:57,019 --> 00:05:58,179
It means no one
can destroy them.

75
00:05:59,455 --> 00:06:01,583
Go to sleep, my son.

76
00:06:01,658 --> 00:06:04,558
But it's just
a story, right, Pops?

77
00:06:04,626 --> 00:06:05,684
Is it now?

78
00:06:05,761 --> 00:06:07,126
Yeah, come on.

79
00:06:07,196 --> 00:06:08,528
Those guys,
they can't be real.

80
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:12,727
Well, my son,
I'm sure you'll find out.

81
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:50,061
How long have you
been there, my friend?

82
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:57,704
They're over there.

83
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,235
I bought them today.

84
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,879
I haven't fed them at all.

85
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:07,079
I will go up first.
You will follow.

86
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:11,180
And remember, Mr. Wink,
don't be shy.

87
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:39,911
<i>Next lot. Number 776.</i>

88
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:42,478
<i>This is an important
votive figure,</i>

89
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:48,153
<i>a fertility goddess dating
approximately 15,000 to 10,000 B.C.</i>

90
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:51,364
<i>This was found
in a loess deposit</i>

91
00:08:51,432 --> 00:08:54,832
<i>in a terrace about 30 meters
from the Shannon River.</i>

92
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:58,896
<i>And we'll open the
bidding at $300,000.</i>

93
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:00,167
<i>Three hundred thousand.</i>

94
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:02,765
<i>Three hundred and
twenty-five, thank you.</i>

95
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,971
<i>Three hundred and fifty,
thank you.</i>

96
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:07,105
<i>Three seventy-five.</i>

97
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,210
<i>Three hundred
and seventy-five.</i>

98
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,980
<i>Going once.
Going twice. Sold.</i>

99
00:09:15,023 --> 00:09:18,584
<i>And now we move on to
our next item, lot 777,</i>

100
00:09:20,094 --> 00:09:22,528
<i>a piece of the Royal
Crown of Bethmoora.</i>

101
00:09:22,597 --> 00:09:24,792
<i>The origin of this
piece harkens back</i>

102
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:27,163
<i>to the saga of
the Sons of the Earth</i>

103
00:09:27,235 --> 00:09:30,727
<i>and the creation of
the fabled Golden Army.</i>

104
00:09:39,048 --> 00:09:41,608
<i>And here it is,
our next item.</i>

105
00:09:41,684 --> 00:09:44,277
<i>Lot 777.</i>

106
00:09:47,423 --> 00:09:49,687
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please keep your seats.</i>

107
00:09:49,758 --> 00:09:51,385
<i>The auction will
restart shortly.</i>

108
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,758
<i>I'm sure this is just
a temporary loss of power.</i>

109
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:56,320
<i>Now, for the first
time at auction,</i>

110
00:09:56,465 --> 00:09:58,990
<i>a piece of the Royal
Crown of Bethmoora,</i>

111
00:09:59,068 --> 00:10:03,129
<i>coming to us from
a long lost culture.</i>

112
00:10:03,205 --> 00:10:04,672
Lost?

113
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:07,441
Not at all.

114
00:10:08,777 --> 00:10:10,904
Forgotten by you,
perhaps,

115
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,415
but very, very much alive.

116
00:10:14,384 --> 00:10:16,011
Who are you, sir?

117
00:10:16,086 --> 00:10:19,145
Sir, please identify yourself.
You can't just...

118
00:10:19,221 --> 00:10:22,714
I am Prince Nuada Silverlance,
son of King Balor.

119
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:27,456
And I am here, sir, to reclaim
what is rightfully mine.

120
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,622
Security. Call security!

121
00:11:06,537 --> 00:11:07,834
What do you think
you're doing?

122
00:11:07,905 --> 00:11:09,167
This is outrageous.

123
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,208
Take what you want.
Please leave.

124
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:13,175
Anything, take anything.

125
00:11:20,986 --> 00:11:22,283
Be quiet.

126
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:29,360
Sit down!

127
00:11:29,428 --> 00:11:32,955
Proud, empty, hollow
things that you are.

128
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:37,766
Let this remind you why
you once feared the dark.

129
00:12:23,816 --> 00:12:27,582
Fishstick. We have to talk.

130
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,614
Undercover.

131
00:12:31,692 --> 00:12:33,124
Can't he get the
meaning of the word?

132
00:12:33,192 --> 00:12:34,887
Look, we are still
government-funded.

133
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:38,591
We are still a secret, although
a dirty secret, if you ask me.

134
00:12:38,665 --> 00:12:42,156
Officially we do
not exist, you see.

135
00:12:42,236 --> 00:12:45,171
So that's the problem
when we get these.

136
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:49,608
Subway. Highway. Park.

137
00:12:50,878 --> 00:12:54,006
And he posed for this one
and gave an autograph.

138
00:12:56,117 --> 00:12:58,482
I suppress each photo.
Cell phone videos.

139
00:12:58,552 --> 00:13:02,215
They cost me a fortune and
they show up on YouTube.

140
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:03,951
God, I hate YouTube.

141
00:13:04,025 --> 00:13:07,221
Well, he just wants the world
outside to know what we do,

142
00:13:07,294 --> 00:13:09,057
what he does.

143
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:10,927
He loathes me.

144
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,023
I don't think so.

145
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,362
No?

146
00:13:13,434 --> 00:13:14,525
Target practice.

147
00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:15,693
Oh, dear.

148
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:18,102
And then he
posts them around.

149
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,666
Do you know how
that makes me feel?

150
00:13:28,983 --> 00:13:30,349
What's going on?

151
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:31,715
Oh, it's Friday.

152
00:13:31,786 --> 00:13:33,617
I tell you, Fishstick,
he hates me.

153
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:34,882
He's out to destroy me.

154
00:13:34,956 --> 00:13:36,891
My street cred is low.

155
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,085
Street cred?

156
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,218
My mojo.

157
00:13:39,295 --> 00:13:42,229
Washington, they're wondering
if I've got the stuff.

158
00:13:42,297 --> 00:13:43,560
You think I have
an easy job?

159
00:13:43,632 --> 00:13:49,570
Do you think
I enjoy being a pain in the neck?

160
00:13:52,241 --> 00:13:53,765
I am medicated.

161
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:56,567
I mean,
this is not candy.

162
00:13:56,644 --> 00:13:58,135
This is...
It's an antacid.

163
00:13:58,214 --> 00:14:00,045
Yes, it's an
over-the-counter medicine,

164
00:14:00,115 --> 00:14:02,743
but this is medicine.

165
00:14:02,818 --> 00:14:06,379
You see, I worry
because, you know,

166
00:14:06,455 --> 00:14:09,481
I mean, I am,
we are, after all,

167
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,652
we're just humble
public servants.

168
00:14:12,729 --> 00:14:15,891
It's not about you.
He's acting out.

169
00:14:15,965 --> 00:14:18,196
Things are a little
tense with Liz.

170
00:14:18,268 --> 00:14:21,533
Tense? How tense?
Tense how?

171
00:14:21,605 --> 00:14:24,095
Well, you know, the usual.

172
00:14:24,241 --> 00:14:26,505
A new couple
making adjustments.

173
00:14:26,576 --> 00:14:28,476
- They argue.
- They argue, huh?

174
00:14:28,545 --> 00:14:29,705
- Sometimes.
- How bad?

175
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:31,041
Like everybody else.

176
00:14:31,114 --> 00:14:34,106
They have good days
and bad days.

177
00:14:36,219 --> 00:14:38,017
I'm not done with you.

178
00:15:01,746 --> 00:15:02,906
Hey, Abe.

179
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,344
Red, come back here!

180
00:15:04,414 --> 00:15:05,541
Manning.

181
00:15:05,616 --> 00:15:06,844
Pick up your clothes!

182
00:15:06,918 --> 00:15:08,112
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

183
00:15:08,185 --> 00:15:09,652
Put away your things!

184
00:15:10,788 --> 00:15:12,779
Watch it,
boys, she's on fire.

185
00:15:12,857 --> 00:15:15,758
Then again, there are
the really bad days.

186
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:18,954
I'm not afraid
of you, you know.

187
00:15:19,031 --> 00:15:21,498
You should be.
Look at this mess. Look around.

188
00:15:21,565 --> 00:15:24,500
I have one rule.
Don't touch my stuff.

189
00:15:24,568 --> 00:15:26,935
Oh, I get it.
That's your rule. Okay.

190
00:15:27,005 --> 00:15:29,337
The one and only.
I'm easy.

191
00:15:29,407 --> 00:15:30,499
How's that even possible?

192
00:15:30,574 --> 00:15:31,598
Everything is your stuff.

193
00:15:31,676 --> 00:15:33,406
The same CD, LP.

194
00:15:33,478 --> 00:15:34,706
It's Al Green.

195
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,940
You can't listen
to Al Green on CD.

196
00:15:36,014 --> 00:15:37,174
But it's good to keep.

197
00:15:37,249 --> 00:15:38,738
And an eight-track.
An eight-track, Red?

198
00:15:38,816 --> 00:15:41,479
Yeah, well, one day, the world's
gonna realize its mistake.

199
00:15:41,553 --> 00:15:43,180
Eight-track was
the way to go, baby.

200
00:15:43,255 --> 00:15:45,781
Come on, kids,
you can come out now.

201
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:48,484
That's right, it's all over.
That's right.

202
00:15:49,561 --> 00:15:51,188
And what about me, Red?

203
00:15:51,263 --> 00:15:52,822
I need some space.

204
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:57,497
At least enough to
find my toothbrush.

205
00:15:57,636 --> 00:15:59,867
Toothbrush? Wait a minute.

206
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,001
It's right there.

207
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:09,604
Red! I can't
live like this.

208
00:16:12,451 --> 00:16:13,646
Oh, damn.

209
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,483
Gotta go.
We all gotta go.

210
00:16:15,555 --> 00:16:17,523
It's an emergency, right?

211
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,784
Let's go.

212
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:20,382
Red. Red!

213
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,927
<i>All personnel to garage area.</i>

214
00:16:21,995 --> 00:16:23,428
Hold on a sec.

215
00:16:23,496 --> 00:16:26,465
Oh, jeez, it's Manning.
Watch yourself, Liz.

216
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:27,932
Red. Red!

217
00:16:28,002 --> 00:16:29,525
Listen.

218
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:30,660
- Manning.
- Hi.

219
00:16:30,737 --> 00:16:31,931
We're going to
downtown Manhattan.

220
00:16:32,005 --> 00:16:33,165
Yeah, it'll be fun.

221
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:34,673
Downtown.
Very dangerous.

222
00:16:34,742 --> 00:16:36,141
Dangerous for you.

223
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,370
And for me.

224
00:16:38,444 --> 00:16:40,640
Now, I know you dream
of the outside world,

225
00:16:40,714 --> 00:16:42,147
but, trust me,
it's not that great.

226
00:16:42,216 --> 00:16:45,844
It's savage, as a
matter of fact. Bad.

227
00:16:45,918 --> 00:16:47,819
Come on, fellas,
let's get this out of here.

228
00:16:47,888 --> 00:16:50,118
These, on the
other hand, are good.

229
00:16:51,892 --> 00:16:53,450
Cuban.

230
00:16:53,527 --> 00:16:55,017
Good.

231
00:16:55,095 --> 00:16:56,221
Being seen?

232
00:16:56,296 --> 00:16:57,354
Bad.

233
00:16:57,431 --> 00:17:01,266
Exactly. I confiscated a box of these,
and I'll get you some more.

234
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:04,862
But you've gotta do me
a little favor tonight, out there.

235
00:17:04,938 --> 00:17:08,431
You have to be...
You have to be very, very...

236
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,499
Discreet.

237
00:17:09,577 --> 00:17:11,066
- What? Thank you. Yes.
- You're welcome.

238
00:17:11,145 --> 00:17:12,407
Discreet.

239
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:15,540
Invisible. In and out.

240
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,753
- Really?
- Hey.

241
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,482
Hey, I can be
discreet if I wanna be.

242
00:17:21,556 --> 00:17:23,046
I followed you
and Myers, didn't I?

243
00:17:23,124 --> 00:17:25,183
And then you had him
transferred to Antarctica.

244
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,921
That's very discreet.

245
00:17:27,062 --> 00:17:28,757
He said he liked the cold.

246
00:17:30,865 --> 00:17:32,264
Like a shadow.

247
00:17:33,568 --> 00:17:35,799
<i>Red team, Red team.</i>

248
00:17:38,006 --> 00:17:40,736
Like a shadow
in the night.

249
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,813
US Customs discovered
a few illegally imported items.

250
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:59,383
It's a minor infraction.
And a gas pocket.

251
00:17:59,462 --> 00:18:02,397
They detected
a gas pocket up there.

252
00:18:02,465 --> 00:18:05,764
Now FBI agents,
under my command,

253
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:10,329
are going up there right now
with special gas equipment.

254
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:15,243
Jeez, it stinks in here.

255
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:17,903
This is worse
than my room.

256
00:18:22,886 --> 00:18:23,978
Say "cheese".

257
00:18:25,155 --> 00:18:26,622
Let's go.

258
00:18:54,918 --> 00:18:57,149
Whatever they
called us for is over.

259
00:18:57,221 --> 00:18:59,849
We had over 70
guests reported.

260
00:18:59,924 --> 00:19:02,517
We have no survivors,
no bodies.

261
00:19:02,592 --> 00:19:04,026
Same story here, babe.

262
00:19:04,095 --> 00:19:05,585
<i>Don't call me "babe".</i>

263
00:19:05,663 --> 00:19:08,632
"Abe", I said.
"Abe". Wrong channel.

264
00:19:11,335 --> 00:19:14,964
Abe, I think Liz is
still mad at me.

265
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,507
<i>Still the same channel.</i>

266
00:19:33,926 --> 00:19:35,222
<i>Can I ask
you a question?</i>

267
00:19:35,293 --> 00:19:36,555
No.

268
00:19:36,627 --> 00:19:38,459
Now, listen.
When we get home later,

269
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,293
I'm gonna clean up
my whole mess.

270
00:19:40,365 --> 00:19:41,593
That's not the problem.

271
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:42,690
What is it?

272
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:43,792
Not now.

273
00:19:52,244 --> 00:19:54,542
Abe, what have you got?

274
00:19:54,613 --> 00:19:56,774
Oh, this is interesting.

275
00:19:56,848 --> 00:19:59,409
Both boxes have
the Royal Seal.

276
00:19:59,485 --> 00:20:02,248
Only delivered
at a time of war.

277
00:20:38,592 --> 00:20:41,322
Red? We have company.

278
00:20:43,463 --> 00:20:45,932
<i>Come on, Blue,
give me something to work with here.</i>

279
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,467
Burrowing creatures.

280
00:20:47,534 --> 00:20:48,967
- How many of them?
- Many.

281
00:20:49,036 --> 00:20:53,029
There are no corpses because
there are no leftovers.

282
00:20:53,107 --> 00:20:55,007
<i>Have you noticed the floor?</i>

283
00:20:55,075 --> 00:20:56,099
Oh, crap.

284
00:20:56,176 --> 00:20:57,165
<i>Precisely.</i>

285
00:20:57,244 --> 00:20:59,235
All these things
do is eat and eat.

286
00:20:59,313 --> 00:21:01,281
Then poop,
and then eat again.

287
00:21:01,348 --> 00:21:03,179
Remind you of anyone?

288
00:21:03,884 --> 00:21:05,819
Damn it, Abe.
What are these things?

289
00:21:08,422 --> 00:21:09,889
<i>English, English.</i>

290
00:21:09,957 --> 00:21:10,981
Oh, they're Tooth Fairies.

291
00:21:12,294 --> 00:21:14,353
No, no. Third century,
Black Forest.

292
00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:18,194
Feed mostly on calcium,
bones, skin, organs.

293
00:21:18,265 --> 00:21:22,032
But they do go
for the teeth first.

294
00:21:22,103 --> 00:21:24,127
Hence the name
Tooth Fairies.

295
00:21:24,204 --> 00:21:27,072
I bet you they don't
leave money, either.

296
00:21:38,687 --> 00:21:40,053
Oh, my God.

297
00:21:41,823 --> 00:21:44,053
Liz, you're pregnant.

298
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,422
No, I'm not.

299
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,892
Yes, you are.

300
00:21:59,441 --> 00:22:01,137
What have you got, Marble?

301
00:22:01,277 --> 00:22:03,074
Think I may have found one.

302
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,680
But he's kind of cute.

303
00:22:09,118 --> 00:22:10,847
Don't go near it!

304
00:22:19,228 --> 00:22:20,924
It's biting me!

305
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:24,530
Marble.

306
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,431
It hurts! It hurts!

307
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,256
<i>Red, we need you here!</i>

308
00:22:51,261 --> 00:22:52,489
Marble.

309
00:22:55,533 --> 00:22:56,931
Nasty little...

310
00:23:09,981 --> 00:23:12,108
Keep firing, Abe.
Keep firing!

311
00:23:26,063 --> 00:23:27,155
Damn.

312
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,053
Sorry, lady.

313
00:23:56,094 --> 00:23:58,119
You should be running.

314
00:23:58,197 --> 00:24:00,165
There's a safe upstairs.

315
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:01,631
How do we get there?

316
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,168
We need a clearing.

317
00:24:04,237 --> 00:24:05,328
Run!

318
00:24:12,145 --> 00:24:13,907
Up to the safe, now!

319
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,948
Abe. Up the stairs.

320
00:24:23,022 --> 00:24:26,048
- Come on, Liz, burn them all.
- Go. Go!

321
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:28,150
Yes, we're going!

322
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:31,423
Get in the safe, Abe.
Get in the safe!

323
00:24:41,174 --> 00:24:42,505
Oh, no, no.

324
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,935
No, no, no!

325
00:24:46,013 --> 00:24:47,172
Steel!

326
00:24:58,993 --> 00:25:00,392
Damned beasts.

327
00:25:06,433 --> 00:25:08,901
Fire is mine.

328
00:25:09,837 --> 00:25:12,032
Fire is in me.

329
00:25:12,106 --> 00:25:14,802
Red, stay away
from the window!

330
00:25:15,976 --> 00:25:18,468
Fire is me.

331
00:25:18,547 --> 00:25:20,980
Stop biting me!

332
00:25:23,718 --> 00:25:28,087
Fire is me.

333
00:25:29,456 --> 00:25:31,652
World, here I come.

334
00:26:18,342 --> 00:26:20,104
What have you done?

335
00:26:21,043 --> 00:26:22,203
Guess we're out.

336
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:24,371
Hey, Hellboy,
over here.

337
00:26:58,482 --> 00:27:00,508
Your Royal Highness.

338
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:16,458
Before entering
the council chamber,

339
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:21,028
you must surrender
your weapon.

340
00:27:21,105 --> 00:27:22,572
I will not.

341
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:31,741
It is protocol, sire,
for peasant and prince alike.

342
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,728
For you, Sister,

343
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,034
anything.

344
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:59,367
<i>According to multiple eye witnesses,
lives were, in fact, endangered.</i>

345
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:00,969
<i>There you have it, Hellboy.</i>

346
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,775
<i>But is he really
on our side?</i>

347
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,145
<i>Do you have superpowers?</i>

348
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:05,444
<i>Well, yeah.</i>

349
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,214
<i>But, really, all I wanna be
is just an ordinary person,</i>

350
00:28:08,288 --> 00:28:09,481
<i>just like you and
you and everybody.</i>

351
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:13,583
Hey, guys.
You're missing this.

352
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:16,059
We're on TV.

353
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:20,156
Liz. Liz,
are you all right?

354
00:28:20,233 --> 00:28:22,133
Yeah, I'll be out
in a minute.

355
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:24,803
You don't need to do that.
You can trust me.

356
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:26,099
My readings are
quite accurate.

357
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:27,332
Shut up, Abe.

358
00:28:27,407 --> 00:28:30,035
Get your damn hand
away from the door.

359
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,105
You have nothing to fear.

360
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:34,477
In spite of appearances,

361
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:37,414
I believe Red would be an
excellent father figure.

362
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:41,980
<i>And what about this guy?</i>

363
00:28:42,056 --> 00:28:43,750
<i>Walking around with a
toilet seat on his head.</i>

364
00:28:43,823 --> 00:28:45,051
A toilet seat!

365
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:48,493
It's quite obvious it's
a breathing apparatus.

366
00:28:48,562 --> 00:28:50,792
Hey, I think we gotta
lose the garbage truck.

367
00:28:50,865 --> 00:28:52,889
Sends out the wrong signal.

368
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,331
You think that's
our problem?

369
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:57,927
Transportation?

370
00:28:59,707 --> 00:29:02,471
<i>And this girl, we definitely have
to find out what's wrong with her.</i>

371
00:29:02,543 --> 00:29:04,602
<i>She's cute, though.
We should get her on the show.</i>

372
00:29:04,678 --> 00:29:07,511
I hate it when
people stare at me.

373
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:10,243
Makes me feel
like a freak.

374
00:29:10,317 --> 00:29:12,478
You had no right, Red.

375
00:29:12,553 --> 00:29:13,645
It's Manning. Could you...

376
00:29:13,721 --> 00:29:14,746
<i>How many times do
I have to tell you?</i>

377
00:29:14,823 --> 00:29:17,586
<i>It's a gas pocket.</i>

378
00:29:17,658 --> 00:29:20,126
<i>And a gaseous
phenomenon that occurred...</i>

379
00:29:23,665 --> 00:29:26,462
Gas pocket.
What an idiot.

380
00:29:28,703 --> 00:29:30,364
You've murdered me.

381
00:29:31,006 --> 00:29:32,667
You have murdered me.

382
00:29:35,577 --> 00:29:37,442
You have ridiculed me.

383
00:29:40,949 --> 00:29:43,042
And you have brought
this unto yourself.

384
00:29:43,118 --> 00:29:44,380
What?

385
00:29:44,452 --> 00:29:48,388
Washington is sending
down a new BPRD agent.

386
00:29:48,456 --> 00:29:49,924
A new guy?

387
00:29:50,859 --> 00:29:52,190
Why?

388
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,659
To look after you.

389
00:30:00,235 --> 00:30:02,932
Sire, please.

390
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:27,027
To set us free.
All of us, Father.

391
00:30:32,636 --> 00:30:34,694
A truce based on shame.

392
00:30:35,938 --> 00:30:38,669
The humans have
forgotten the gods,

393
00:30:38,742 --> 00:30:41,176
destroyed the Earth.
And for what?

394
00:30:43,113 --> 00:30:46,105
Parking lots.
Shopping malls.

395
00:30:46,183 --> 00:30:48,515
Greed has burned a hole in their
heart that will never be filled.

396
00:30:48,585 --> 00:30:50,712
They will never
have enough.

397
00:30:58,262 --> 00:30:59,251
Honor?

398
00:31:00,364 --> 00:31:03,528
Look at this place.
Where is the honor in it?

399
00:31:04,636 --> 00:31:07,001
Father, you were
once a proud warrior.

400
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,368
When did you
become their pet?

401
00:31:12,644 --> 00:31:15,237
I have returned
from exile to wage war

402
00:31:15,379 --> 00:31:18,008
and reclaim our land,
our birthright.

403
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:22,185
And for that, I will call upon
the help of all of my people.

404
00:31:22,253 --> 00:31:24,380
And they will answer,

405
00:31:24,455 --> 00:31:27,686
the good, the bad

406
00:31:29,727 --> 00:31:31,093
and the worst.

407
00:31:34,899 --> 00:31:38,563
Perhaps I am.
Perhaps they made me so.

408
00:31:51,483 --> 00:31:54,008
We will not fade.

409
00:31:59,925 --> 00:32:01,119
It is.

410
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,886
I am sorry, Father.

411
00:32:15,507 --> 00:32:20,605
And you, Sister, are you at
peace with your king's verdict?

412
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,239
I am, my brother. I am.

413
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,113
Then very well.
Death it is.

414
00:34:22,338 --> 00:34:25,171
Now, for the final piece,
my sister.

415
00:34:29,213 --> 00:34:31,510
Where is she, Wink?
Where is she?

416
00:34:39,622 --> 00:34:42,592
Go find her.
Now! Find her!

417
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:50,300
<i>Elevator arriving
now to section 42.</i>

418
00:34:51,935 --> 00:34:55,336
<i>Elevator arriving
now to section 42.</i>

419
00:34:57,174 --> 00:34:58,971
Pardon me, boys.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

420
00:34:59,042 --> 00:35:00,703
- Is he here?
- Not yet.

421
00:35:00,777 --> 00:35:01,938
I'm telling you,
we don't need this guy.

422
00:35:02,013 --> 00:35:03,104
Well, I think we do.

423
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,808
Evidently, this guy's quite
the big shot in Washington.

424
00:35:05,883 --> 00:35:07,977
What's his name?

425
00:35:08,052 --> 00:35:10,077
His name is Johann Krauss.

426
00:35:10,155 --> 00:35:12,748
Johann Krauss?
Sounds German.

427
00:35:12,823 --> 00:35:14,381
He's the top man in...

428
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:15,483
Ectoplasmic.

429
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,824
Yes, thank you.
Ectoplasmic research.

430
00:35:17,896 --> 00:35:20,386
Comes highly recommended
by our European liaison.

431
00:35:20,464 --> 00:35:21,830
- Johann Krauss.
- Liaison.

432
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,492
I love that word,
don't you?

433
00:35:23,568 --> 00:35:25,092
It's so hoity toity.

434
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,637
- I don't like Germans.
- No fingerprints.

435
00:35:26,704 --> 00:35:28,399
- Here he comes.
- Germans make me nervous.

436
00:35:28,473 --> 00:35:33,672
No photo. Dossier says, and I translate,
he has a nice open face.

437
00:35:47,825 --> 00:35:49,623
Oh, my God.

438
00:35:50,229 --> 00:35:53,857
<i>Damen und Herren,
Johann Krauss at your service.</i>

439
00:35:54,866 --> 00:35:56,858
I like him.

440
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,835
Look at that.
Poor little thing.

441
00:36:03,909 --> 00:36:05,570
Bought and sold on
the black market.

442
00:36:05,644 --> 00:36:07,236
Crammed into
cargo containers.

443
00:36:07,313 --> 00:36:09,680
Smuggled, abused.

444
00:36:09,749 --> 00:36:11,272
He has very
expressive hands.

445
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:13,409
The seal on the box
worries me also.

446
00:36:13,485 --> 00:36:14,645
A warring emblem.

447
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,846
Yes, from the Bethmoora clan.

448
00:36:15,921 --> 00:36:16,946
The Sons of the Earth.

449
00:36:17,023 --> 00:36:19,183
Your file says you're the
brains of the operation,

450
00:36:19,258 --> 00:36:20,748
and I must admit,
I'm impressed.

451
00:36:20,826 --> 00:36:22,623
In my file, you'll see,
Mr. Krauss,

452
00:36:22,695 --> 00:36:25,665
that I worked very closely
with Abe in his training.

453
00:36:25,732 --> 00:36:26,824
<i>Ja, okay.</i>

454
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,833
Let's see what our little
friend here can remember.

455
00:36:28,901 --> 00:36:32,030
Memory gets a little sketchy
right after you've burned to death.

456
00:36:32,105 --> 00:36:36,405
But maybe Saint
Malachy can help.

457
00:36:36,476 --> 00:36:38,706
<i>Oh, no, no.
No amulets, Mein Herr.</i>

458
00:36:38,778 --> 00:36:39,972
Teleplasty.

459
00:36:40,046 --> 00:36:41,570
Plastic. Very modern.

460
00:36:42,515 --> 00:36:45,006
Teleplasty by which
an ectoplasmic medium,

461
00:36:45,085 --> 00:36:49,078
such as Dr. Krauss,
can control inanimate things,

462
00:36:49,155 --> 00:36:53,717
organic, mechanical,
dead or alive.

463
00:36:53,793 --> 00:36:56,694
<i>Take it, take it all in,
mein Junge.</i>

464
00:36:58,766 --> 00:37:02,201
There we are. Get up.

465
00:37:02,769 --> 00:37:04,670
Get up. Get up.

466
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,775
Now I have full control
of its limbic system.

467
00:37:08,843 --> 00:37:10,868
Let us see how long
I can hold it.

468
00:37:12,046 --> 00:37:13,536
What?

469
00:37:13,614 --> 00:37:15,912
Hey, you chewed off
the tip of my tail.

470
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,916
Yeah, you, you little...

471
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:21,421
<i>It says you're rude, brutish
und not very bright.</i>

472
00:37:27,228 --> 00:37:29,128
It seems our
little friend here

473
00:37:29,196 --> 00:37:31,028
remembers market
sounds and voices.

474
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:33,567
And a peculiar
troll language spoken

475
00:37:33,635 --> 00:37:35,158
in the last place
his cage was opened.

476
00:37:35,236 --> 00:37:37,136
The troll market.

477
00:37:37,204 --> 00:37:39,036
The troll market?
Come on.

478
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,433
No one's ever found it.

479
00:37:41,576 --> 00:37:43,566
That's because
it doesn't exist.

480
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:50,350
Mr. Krauss? Dr. Krauss, sir.

481
00:37:50,419 --> 00:37:53,547
Our little informant there
doesn't look so good.

482
00:38:09,471 --> 00:38:11,872
Back inside, you.
There we are.

483
00:38:12,008 --> 00:38:14,408
So, now we know
where to begin.

484
00:38:14,477 --> 00:38:16,468
Trolls dwell under bridges.

485
00:38:16,546 --> 00:38:18,514
Wow. You're a genius.

486
00:38:18,581 --> 00:38:21,982
By the way, there's over
2,000 bridges in New York City.

487
00:38:22,051 --> 00:38:25,180
But Vladimir Vanya, 19th
century occult historian,

488
00:38:25,255 --> 00:38:26,744
places the troll
market directly under

489
00:38:26,823 --> 00:38:28,256
the east end of
the Brooklyn Bridge.

490
00:38:28,324 --> 00:38:29,348
We've already looked there.

491
00:38:29,425 --> 00:38:31,222
Yes, you have,
but not with me, Agent.

492
00:38:31,294 --> 00:38:32,819
Not with me.

493
00:38:32,896 --> 00:38:34,487
We're moving in.

494
00:38:51,781 --> 00:38:54,148
Keep it coming, keep it coming.
Hold it.

495
00:38:58,122 --> 00:39:00,454
Not with me, Agent.
What an ego.

496
00:39:00,524 --> 00:39:01,650
I like him.

497
00:39:01,725 --> 00:39:03,625
Well, you can keep him.

498
00:39:06,464 --> 00:39:08,328
I mean, am I the only one that
thinks this guy is full of...

499
00:39:08,399 --> 00:39:09,661
No, no, no, no,
don't lean.

500
00:39:09,733 --> 00:39:13,500
Lot 336, the Schufftein
glasses. Could it be?

501
00:39:13,571 --> 00:39:15,232
The three surviving
pairs,

502
00:39:15,306 --> 00:39:16,897
and we will use them to
locate the troll market.

503
00:39:16,974 --> 00:39:18,839
Dr. Krauss, what a coup.

504
00:39:18,909 --> 00:39:20,639
The Schufftein glasses.

505
00:39:20,712 --> 00:39:22,703
You're my hero.

506
00:39:22,781 --> 00:39:23,907
Hey. You Hellboy?

507
00:39:23,982 --> 00:39:25,039
Yeah.

508
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:26,743
You're ugly, man.

509
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:30,453
Two more on
the wall in front of me

510
00:39:30,588 --> 00:39:33,149
and then three on
the alleys facing that way.

511
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:35,485
What do you think of
Mr. Know-It-All?

512
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,652
Don't know,
too early to tell.

513
00:39:36,728 --> 00:39:37,956
Hey, you're Hellboy.

514
00:39:38,029 --> 00:39:39,189
I know, I'm ugly.

515
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,664
Forget it.

516
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,528
We'll talk about it later.

517
00:39:43,168 --> 00:39:47,765
He's sure of himself, and I
think maybe you're intimidated.

518
00:39:48,441 --> 00:39:50,772
Intimidated. Huh?

519
00:39:56,315 --> 00:39:59,408
<i>Keep us up to date on the cameras,
Agent Sherman. Over and out.</i>

520
00:39:59,484 --> 00:40:00,884
What's this?

521
00:40:02,588 --> 00:40:05,182
Normally, we can't see
fairy folk and trolls.

522
00:40:05,291 --> 00:40:09,785
They generate a cloaking
aura called "glamour".

523
00:40:09,862 --> 00:40:13,161
But in 1878,
Emil Schufftein designed and built these.

524
00:40:13,232 --> 00:40:16,133
<i>Four crystal diopters
that penetrate that effect</i>

525
00:40:16,202 --> 00:40:18,670
<i>and reveal the true
nature of things.</i>

526
00:40:18,737 --> 00:40:21,764
Oh, Dr. Krauss, they're more
beautiful than I'd imagined.

527
00:40:21,842 --> 00:40:23,241
- You must try them on then.
- Oh, yes.

528
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:25,174
Try them on, Agent.
They'll look good.

529
00:40:25,244 --> 00:40:27,075
I love these tight
little leather straps.

530
00:40:27,146 --> 00:40:28,546
Intimidated?

531
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:32,480
Mr. Kraut? Sir?

532
00:40:32,551 --> 00:40:34,645
Krauss, Agent,
with a double "S".

533
00:40:34,721 --> 00:40:36,746
S-S. Right, right.

534
00:40:36,823 --> 00:40:39,018
Listen, those gizmos?

535
00:40:42,829 --> 00:40:45,457
How do you know they work?

536
00:40:45,532 --> 00:40:46,590
<i>I have a suspect.</i>

537
00:40:46,666 --> 00:40:49,396
Give me a vector,
Agent Sherman. A vector.

538
00:40:49,803 --> 00:40:52,067
B-12, the alley, northbound.

539
00:40:52,138 --> 00:40:54,402
<i>Well, track the target.
We're coming down.</i>

540
00:40:54,474 --> 00:40:56,705
Keep an eye on her.
I'll be right back.

541
00:40:56,777 --> 00:40:58,539
This little old lady?
Come on.

542
00:40:58,612 --> 00:41:01,548
It's a Fragglewump,
an ugly Scottish troll.

543
00:41:01,616 --> 00:41:03,243
They're afraid of canaries.

544
00:41:03,317 --> 00:41:06,308
Oh, my God. Canaries, huh?

545
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,379
What about the kittens?

546
00:41:08,456 --> 00:41:09,480
She feeds on them.

547
00:41:09,557 --> 00:41:11,923
Come on, then.
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

548
00:41:11,993 --> 00:41:13,654
That thing is a "she"?

549
00:41:35,082 --> 00:41:36,209
Down, you fools.

550
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,582
What do you think
you are doing?

551
00:41:37,653 --> 00:41:38,915
She's gonna eat the cat.

552
00:41:38,987 --> 00:41:41,887
You'll make her
aware of our presence.

553
00:41:41,956 --> 00:41:43,117
We should use
the canary now.

554
00:41:43,191 --> 00:41:44,317
She's gonna eat it!

555
00:41:44,393 --> 00:41:45,621
We should use
the bird, Dr. Krauss.

556
00:41:45,694 --> 00:41:46,854
The bird.

557
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,424
She's going to eat the cat.

558
00:41:50,499 --> 00:41:51,591
You will stay put
and follow my orders.

559
00:41:51,667 --> 00:41:52,725
I can't sit by here...

560
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,826
You are directly under my command,
and you have to obey.

561
00:41:54,903 --> 00:41:56,462
- Stay put!
- Oh, screw this!

562
00:41:56,539 --> 00:41:57,869
Hey! Lucy.

563
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,202
Come back here.

564
00:41:59,274 --> 00:42:00,969
I'm home.

565
00:42:01,043 --> 00:42:03,478
Oh, yes, dearie.
Can I help you?

566
00:42:03,546 --> 00:42:05,775
Give it up, nasty.
We can see you.

567
00:42:05,847 --> 00:42:07,212
You see me?

568
00:42:07,282 --> 00:42:09,808
How? How do you see me?

569
00:42:10,853 --> 00:42:12,377
We're looking
for the entrance

570
00:42:12,455 --> 00:42:13,921
to the troll market,
any clues?

571
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:16,220
Come any closer and
I'll rip your heart.

572
00:42:16,292 --> 00:42:18,055
We're gonna have to get
a little old-school, Abe.

573
00:42:18,127 --> 00:42:19,856
Give me the bird.

574
00:42:21,397 --> 00:42:23,092
Not a canary.

575
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,930
What, you're afraid
of this little guy?

576
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:27,299
Who'd know?

577
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:28,598
No more, no more.

578
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,162
I'll take you there.

579
00:42:32,775 --> 00:42:35,972
Come on, let's go,
you dirty old troll.

580
00:42:52,963 --> 00:42:54,430
Let's go.

581
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:57,227
Agent Sherman, we are
going into the troll market.

582
00:42:57,301 --> 00:42:58,666
Keep communication
to a minimum.

583
00:42:58,736 --> 00:43:00,067
<i>Over und out.</i>

584
00:43:00,137 --> 00:43:01,934
I like him.

585
00:43:02,006 --> 00:43:03,598
You see, this is
a man who takes charge.

586
00:43:03,674 --> 00:43:04,698
You think?

587
00:43:04,775 --> 00:43:05,901
Yeah. He's efficient.

588
00:43:05,976 --> 00:43:07,807
He's precise.

589
00:43:07,878 --> 00:43:10,312
You add "resistant" to that,
you got yourself a new watch.

590
00:43:10,381 --> 00:43:14,112
Dr. Krauss is aware of the
chain of command, and he...

591
00:43:14,184 --> 00:43:15,310
Oh, brother!

592
00:43:15,386 --> 00:43:16,876
He seems to like me.

593
00:43:21,525 --> 00:43:23,152
Here we are.

594
00:43:24,696 --> 00:43:26,596
Wow, that's some door!

595
00:43:30,701 --> 00:43:32,727
It's a complex
combination lock.

596
00:43:32,871 --> 00:43:34,930
What do you think,
Agent Sapien?

597
00:43:36,041 --> 00:43:37,133
Not good.

598
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:40,302
With the number of symbols on the
combination, we'll be here for days.

599
00:43:40,378 --> 00:43:41,504
Well, not necessarily.

600
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:43,274
Let me try my technique.

601
00:43:43,348 --> 00:43:44,680
Open it, Lucy.

602
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,274
I will not.

603
00:43:46,352 --> 00:43:47,579
Pretty please.

604
00:43:49,187 --> 00:43:50,848
Do as you may, demon.

605
00:43:50,989 --> 00:43:52,651
Release the yellow beast.

606
00:43:52,725 --> 00:43:53,885
Tear my eyes out.

607
00:43:53,959 --> 00:43:56,893
Rip my insides and
my legs and my tongue,

608
00:43:56,961 --> 00:43:59,294
but I will never
open that door.

609
00:44:07,273 --> 00:44:09,673
Is that your
investigative technique?

610
00:44:09,742 --> 00:44:10,936
It said "never".

611
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:12,500
It's unconscionable.

612
00:44:13,279 --> 00:44:14,644
That means
he didn't like it.

613
00:44:14,714 --> 00:44:16,045
What?

614
00:44:16,115 --> 00:44:18,049
So, what, you're gonna
show us how it's done,

615
00:44:18,117 --> 00:44:20,143
Mr. By-The-Book?

616
00:44:20,386 --> 00:44:21,819
Is that it?

617
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:24,321
Yes, I think I will.

618
00:44:29,028 --> 00:44:30,359
There we are.

619
00:44:31,864 --> 00:44:34,493
Let me see. Yes.

620
00:44:54,254 --> 00:44:57,553
Gentlemen, welcome
to the troll market.

621
00:45:35,998 --> 00:45:39,865
<i>Red, there's something really
important that I need to tell you.</i>

622
00:45:39,934 --> 00:45:42,529
Oh, Liz, you should
be here. You'd love it.

623
00:45:42,604 --> 00:45:45,003
Nobody's looking at us.
We blend right in.

624
00:45:45,072 --> 00:45:47,769
Agent, I said keep
communication to a minimum.

625
00:45:47,843 --> 00:45:49,470
You'll blow our cover.

626
00:45:49,545 --> 00:45:51,376
You know?
I think he's right.

627
00:45:52,981 --> 00:45:55,074
I'm bringing you
here for sure, babe.

628
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:56,811
<i>The fishbowl wants
radio silence. So...</i>

629
00:45:56,885 --> 00:45:58,512
Over and out.

630
00:46:21,511 --> 00:46:23,035
The Royal Seal.

631
00:46:37,727 --> 00:46:39,820
Brother Red.
Red, do you read me?

632
00:46:39,896 --> 00:46:42,866
Yeah, I read you, Blue,
but I'm watching Sherlock at work.

633
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:44,058
I'll get back to you.

634
00:46:44,133 --> 00:46:45,191
Excuse me, sir.

635
00:46:45,268 --> 00:46:49,000
Sir, excuse... Pardon me.
Sir, may I ask a...

636
00:46:53,309 --> 00:46:55,540
I gotta tell
the boys that one.

637
00:46:55,613 --> 00:46:56,637
Excuse me, gentlemen.

638
00:46:56,714 --> 00:46:59,649
Have you seen anyone purchasing
this type of Tooth Fairy?

639
00:46:59,717 --> 00:47:01,308
No one sells them
down here, pal.

640
00:47:01,384 --> 00:47:02,909
Over in Jersey, maybe.

641
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,978
Well, what about this, then?

642
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:07,113
Do you recognize this seal?

643
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:08,659
Make him go away.
Make him go away.

644
00:47:08,727 --> 00:47:10,125
No. We don't.

645
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:11,354
Please, dear sir.

646
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:13,953
You'd better go. Now!

647
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:15,226
We'll make it
worth your while.

648
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:19,128
Don't waste your time.
We will not talk!

649
00:47:19,637 --> 00:47:20,626
What are you doing?

650
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:22,434
You're absolutely
sure about that, huh?

651
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:23,872
Absolutely.

652
00:47:23,942 --> 00:47:25,034
You won't talk, eh?

653
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,133
Never.

654
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:27,370
Never, huh?

655
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:29,879
Never ever, ever.

656
00:47:54,973 --> 00:47:56,134
Feeling a little
chattier now?

657
00:47:56,208 --> 00:47:57,573
We'll never talk.

658
00:47:57,810 --> 00:47:59,243
Yes, yes.

659
00:47:59,312 --> 00:48:01,836
We will, only don't
hit me anymore.

660
00:48:01,913 --> 00:48:03,404
Chicken.

661
00:48:03,482 --> 00:48:05,109
Who bought
the Tooth Fairies?

662
00:48:05,184 --> 00:48:06,776
Prince Nuada.

663
00:48:06,852 --> 00:48:08,910
They say Prince Nuada
broke the truce,

664
00:48:08,987 --> 00:48:10,649
and now there is
talk of war,

665
00:48:10,723 --> 00:48:12,850
a war with
the human world.

666
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:15,484
Sorry, kid.

667
00:48:15,561 --> 00:48:16,926
That's all right.

668
00:48:17,163 --> 00:48:18,528
Nice baby.

669
00:48:18,597 --> 00:48:21,065
I'm not a baby.
I'm a tumor.

670
00:48:24,037 --> 00:48:28,370
Yes, Red. I am following
a lead right now.

671
00:48:28,441 --> 00:48:30,103
It may turn out...

672
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:34,842
It may turn out
to be nothing,

673
00:48:34,981 --> 00:48:37,280
but I will let you
know soon enough.

674
00:49:06,247 --> 00:49:08,976
What do you want?
Tell me your name.

675
00:49:15,856 --> 00:49:17,323
Follow me.

676
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,828
Your father
left you this map.

677
00:49:21,896 --> 00:49:24,922
In it, he said,
lies the secret

678
00:49:25,066 --> 00:49:27,591
to the location
of the Golden Army.

679
00:49:28,903 --> 00:49:31,372
Move away!
Quickly, Your Highness.

680
00:49:34,709 --> 00:49:36,574
Can I help you
with something?

681
00:49:36,644 --> 00:49:38,476
No, thank you.
I'm just looking.

682
00:49:38,547 --> 00:49:40,310
You can't go in there!

683
00:49:40,382 --> 00:49:41,848
Sir, why
are you following me?

684
00:49:41,916 --> 00:49:43,406
I...

685
00:49:43,584 --> 00:49:47,385
I was just hoping to find
an old map chart of Algiers.

686
00:49:47,456 --> 00:49:49,048
Why are you following me?

687
00:49:49,124 --> 00:49:50,750
I was not.

688
00:49:50,925 --> 00:49:53,622
Did my brother send you
to steal the crown piece?

689
00:49:53,695 --> 00:49:54,957
Your brother?

690
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:57,828
Oh, you're sorely
mistaken, I assure you.

691
00:49:58,333 --> 00:49:59,800
Then answer me truthfully.

692
00:49:59,868 --> 00:50:01,597
Why were you following me?

693
00:50:04,273 --> 00:50:06,833
My name is Abraham Sapien.

694
00:50:08,544 --> 00:50:09,704
There is no such name.

695
00:50:09,778 --> 00:50:11,075
Oh, I don't like
it either, but I...

696
00:50:11,146 --> 00:50:12,375
Enough.

697
00:50:12,449 --> 00:50:14,713
Give me your hand.

698
00:50:14,784 --> 00:50:16,114
Your hand.

699
00:50:23,592 --> 00:50:25,287
You are an agent

700
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,660
for the Bureau of Paranormal
Research and Defense.

701
00:50:29,766 --> 00:50:31,529
And your name is...

702
00:50:34,304 --> 00:50:35,931
Horrible, I know.

703
00:50:36,005 --> 00:50:38,633
I'm Nuala,
Princess Nuala.

704
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:40,676
Yes, I know.

705
00:50:40,743 --> 00:50:42,574
Forgive me,
Your Highness,

706
00:50:42,645 --> 00:50:44,636
but as you were
learning about me,

707
00:50:44,714 --> 00:50:47,878
I couldn't help but learn
a bit about you myself.

708
00:50:49,385 --> 00:50:51,080
I know that you
need our help.

709
00:50:51,154 --> 00:50:53,214
I'm afraid it's
the other way around.

710
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,599
The window. Out now.

711
00:51:04,668 --> 00:51:06,032
I will take care of this.

712
00:51:06,102 --> 00:51:07,365
Oh, dear.

713
00:51:27,926 --> 00:51:29,450
Go! Now go!

714
00:51:48,847 --> 00:51:50,781
Get out of here, Blue.

715
00:51:50,849 --> 00:51:52,714
Yes. Come with me,
Your Highness.

716
00:51:52,784 --> 00:51:53,773
You.

717
00:51:55,688 --> 00:51:58,747
Let me put this to you
as delicately as I can.

718
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:07,699
My cigar, it was Cuban.

719
00:52:08,401 --> 00:52:10,301
Now you pissed me off.

720
00:52:19,545 --> 00:52:20,842
Oh, crap.

721
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:43,655
Now stay down!

722
00:54:00,849 --> 00:54:01,975
Damn.

723
00:54:05,521 --> 00:54:07,489
A tooth. Happy?

724
00:54:13,529 --> 00:54:15,622
Give it up, pal.
It's over.

725
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,395
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

726
00:54:32,682 --> 00:54:34,650
Wow. Told you.

727
00:54:43,961 --> 00:54:46,986
<i>Oh, mein Gott,
what have you done, Agent Hellboy?</i>

728
00:54:47,063 --> 00:54:48,928
Look at this!
Now we have to leave.

729
00:54:48,998 --> 00:54:51,559
Red. This is Princess Nuala.

730
00:54:52,436 --> 00:54:53,766
Lady.

731
00:54:53,837 --> 00:54:55,099
We should leave.
Now. Now!

732
00:54:55,171 --> 00:54:56,468
Let's go.

733
00:55:33,412 --> 00:55:37,006
To wage his war,
my brother needs this,

734
00:55:37,081 --> 00:55:39,346
the final piece of
the Crown of Bethmoora

735
00:55:39,418 --> 00:55:41,886
and this map to the location
of the Golden Army chamber.

736
00:55:41,953 --> 00:55:44,046
The Golden Army.

737
00:55:44,122 --> 00:55:45,749
The harbingers of death.

738
00:55:45,824 --> 00:55:47,416
The unstoppable tide.

739
00:55:48,293 --> 00:55:49,282
Howdy Doody.

740
00:55:49,361 --> 00:55:52,092
Your Highness, if you hand
the crown piece over to us...

741
00:55:52,165 --> 00:55:54,359
No. Where it goes, I go.

742
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:57,767
My father died to uphold
the truce with your world.

743
00:55:57,836 --> 00:55:59,532
You must honor
his noble intention.

744
00:55:59,605 --> 00:56:00,902
The lady's
in dire danger.

745
00:56:00,973 --> 00:56:03,600
I take it you're vouching for her,
Agent Sapien?

746
00:56:03,675 --> 00:56:06,167
Most emphatically.
Yes, I am.

747
00:56:06,245 --> 00:56:07,473
Even so.

748
00:56:08,147 --> 00:56:11,081
I am sorry, but we
simply cannot assume

749
00:56:11,149 --> 00:56:13,141
such responsibility
on our own.

750
00:56:13,219 --> 00:56:14,584
The lady just
lost her father.

751
00:56:14,654 --> 00:56:15,985
What more do you want?

752
00:56:16,055 --> 00:56:19,286
You may not care, but
there are procedures, rules

753
00:56:19,358 --> 00:56:20,848
and little handbooks...

754
00:56:20,927 --> 00:56:22,360
She's coming with us.

755
00:56:22,428 --> 00:56:23,520
You got that, Gas Bag?

756
00:56:23,596 --> 00:56:24,654
What did you call me?

757
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:26,130
You.

758
00:56:28,935 --> 00:56:31,130
You will pay for what happened
to my friend down there.

759
00:56:31,204 --> 00:56:33,435
Yeah, right.
You take checks?

760
00:56:33,507 --> 00:56:34,769
Demon.

761
00:56:34,842 --> 00:56:36,138
Born from a womb of shadows.

762
00:56:36,209 --> 00:56:39,042
Sent to destroy their world,
and you still believe you belong.

763
00:56:39,111 --> 00:56:40,579
Are we gonna
talk all night?

764
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,342
'Cause I'm really sleepy.

765
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,472
No, Brother, no!

766
00:56:59,793 --> 00:57:01,056
Kill him.

767
00:57:11,939 --> 00:57:13,635
It's just a jumping bean.

768
00:57:13,709 --> 00:57:15,539
It's going for water. Hurry.

769
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,270
Oh, dear.

770
00:57:21,516 --> 00:57:23,983
No. No, no, no, no. No.

771
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,182
- What the hell is that?
- Excuse me!

772
00:57:56,918 --> 00:57:59,317
- Stay back.
- Hey, what's going on?

773
00:58:26,415 --> 00:58:28,441
<i>We've got
target in sight.</i>

774
00:58:29,786 --> 00:58:31,776
It's an Elemental,

775
00:58:31,853 --> 00:58:33,980
a giver of life
and a destroyer.

776
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:35,115
What?

777
00:58:35,191 --> 00:58:36,419
A Forest God.

778
00:58:37,759 --> 00:58:39,660
A Forest God, eh?

779
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:43,790
I'm gonna get me Big Baby.

780
00:58:51,673 --> 00:58:55,269
Somebody help! My baby's...
Help! Help!

781
00:58:55,779 --> 00:58:56,938
How can I help you, ma'am?

782
00:58:57,013 --> 00:58:58,775
My baby's inside!

783
00:58:58,847 --> 00:59:00,713
Come with us,
dear lady, please.

784
00:59:00,783 --> 00:59:02,249
There's nothing
to worry about.

785
00:59:02,317 --> 00:59:03,751
We've got everything
under control.

786
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:06,914
Please. My baby's
still in there! Please!

787
00:59:20,036 --> 00:59:21,800
Hey, little guy.

788
00:59:37,721 --> 00:59:39,552
<i>Homing in on target.</i>

789
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:44,949
Hang on, kid.

790
00:59:55,571 --> 00:59:56,631
Agent Hellboy.

791
00:59:56,708 --> 00:59:58,937
Reach higher ground
and shoot the weapon.

792
00:59:59,242 --> 01:00:00,471
Shoot the weapon!

793
01:00:16,694 --> 01:00:18,786
First praise the tail, kid.

794
01:00:35,279 --> 01:00:37,442
You must shoot it in
the energy ganglion.

795
01:00:37,516 --> 01:00:38,539
The what?

796
01:00:38,616 --> 01:00:39,604
The energy ganglion.

797
01:00:39,683 --> 01:00:42,550
<i>Scheisse. The head!
Shoot it in the head!</i>

798
01:00:54,365 --> 01:00:55,696
Oh, crap.

799
01:01:00,371 --> 01:01:03,033
You gotta trust me,
little buddy. Okay?

800
01:01:14,052 --> 01:01:15,848
You woke up the baby.

801
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:45,149
Agent Hellboy,
take the shot!

802
01:01:45,218 --> 01:01:47,150
Right now! Take it!

803
01:01:47,218 --> 01:01:49,186
That's an order!
Take the shot.

804
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,313
That's an order,
Agent Hellboy.

805
01:01:51,391 --> 01:01:55,985
Shoot it!
Shoot the gun! Shoot the gun!

806
01:01:59,565 --> 01:02:01,090
Demon.

807
01:02:01,368 --> 01:02:03,458
What are you waiting for?

808
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,695
This is what you
wanted, isn't it?

809
01:02:05,771 --> 01:02:08,797
Look at it.
It's the last of its kind.

810
01:02:12,978 --> 01:02:15,674
Like you and I.
You destroy it,

811
01:02:15,748 --> 01:02:18,081
the world will never
see its like again.

812
01:02:22,221 --> 01:02:23,245
Shoot it!

813
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:25,791
You have more in common
with us than with them.

814
01:02:25,859 --> 01:02:27,086
It's breaking free.

815
01:02:27,159 --> 01:02:28,684
You could be a king.

816
01:02:28,827 --> 01:02:30,350
You will not
disobey a direct order!

817
01:02:30,428 --> 01:02:32,193
Shoot it!
It's getting loose!

818
01:02:32,265 --> 01:02:33,391
If you cannot command...

819
01:02:33,466 --> 01:02:34,558
It will
destroy everything!

820
01:02:34,634 --> 01:02:35,827
That's an order,
Agent Hellboy!

821
01:02:35,901 --> 01:02:37,061
...then you must obey.

822
01:02:37,136 --> 01:02:39,002
- Shoot it now!
- Damn.

823
01:02:40,373 --> 01:02:41,635
Shoot it!

824
01:03:14,374 --> 01:03:18,140
Move back.
Step back, step back.

825
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:55,238
It's beautiful.

826
01:04:17,972 --> 01:04:21,841
And this huge monster
just came out of nowhere!

827
01:04:30,651 --> 01:04:33,119
Yo, give the
baby back, man!

828
01:04:33,888 --> 01:04:36,687
Oh, what have you
done to my baby?

829
01:04:36,758 --> 01:04:37,782
The baby's fine.

830
01:04:37,859 --> 01:04:38,881
You freak!

831
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,119
Hellboy,
what'd you do to that baby?

832
01:04:40,194 --> 01:04:41,457
The baby's fine.

833
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:44,054
Don't move.
Hands in the air! Up!

834
01:04:44,131 --> 01:04:45,758
He's got a weapon
in his hand.

835
01:04:45,833 --> 01:04:47,801
That is his hand.

836
01:04:47,868 --> 01:04:50,633
Miss, stay away from him
for your own safety.

837
01:04:50,705 --> 01:04:52,797
He was trying to help.
Don't you see?

838
01:04:53,108 --> 01:04:55,166
He was just trying to help.

839
01:04:56,378 --> 01:04:58,573
That's all we do.

840
01:04:58,647 --> 01:05:00,114
That's all we've
done all these years.

841
01:05:00,182 --> 01:05:01,615
She's touching
his hand!

842
01:05:01,683 --> 01:05:04,846
We've just tried to
help you. You.

843
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:08,356
You're a goddamn freak.

844
01:05:08,958 --> 01:05:10,948
We don't need
you around!

845
01:05:24,073 --> 01:05:25,563
What a freak.

846
01:05:25,675 --> 01:05:26,732
Liz.

847
01:05:34,484 --> 01:05:35,973
Let's go home.

848
01:05:37,254 --> 01:05:42,188
<i>...investigation of the BPRD and its
promotion of intra-species marriage</i>

849
01:05:42,258 --> 01:05:45,488
<i>seen by many as a threat
to traditional families,</i>

850
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:47,392
<i>fuelled by federal funds.</i>

851
01:05:48,897 --> 01:05:50,799
I didn't touch you yet.

852
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:57,867
You did a good job
out there.

853
01:05:59,041 --> 01:06:02,875
Then tell me, why
don't I feel so good?

854
01:06:02,945 --> 01:06:07,406
I mean, I killed that thing.
And for what?

855
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:11,120
They don't even like me.

856
01:06:12,221 --> 01:06:14,019
I mean, they're afraid of me.

857
01:06:14,857 --> 01:06:16,621
What do we do with that?

858
01:06:16,992 --> 01:06:20,052
Red, I don't want
you to freak out.

859
01:06:22,265 --> 01:06:24,792
I'm gonna leave
for a little bit.

860
01:06:26,768 --> 01:06:28,600
I need time to think.

861
01:06:29,438 --> 01:06:30,929
About what?

862
01:06:31,008 --> 01:06:33,272
Can't you do your
thinking right here?

863
01:06:33,442 --> 01:06:35,376
Look, I'll be really,
really quiet.

864
01:06:35,444 --> 01:06:37,344
I'll get rid of the cats.

865
01:06:38,982 --> 01:06:41,007
Red, why are you with me?

866
01:06:41,984 --> 01:06:44,783
Do you need
everyone to like you?

867
01:06:44,855 --> 01:06:48,086
Everybody?
Or am I enough?

868
01:06:49,226 --> 01:06:50,749
Think about it.

869
01:06:59,135 --> 01:07:03,071
<i>You stay.
We belong dead.</i>

870
01:07:10,681 --> 01:07:13,548
It's blank.
No coordinates.

871
01:07:26,763 --> 01:07:29,425
<i>Be near me
when my light is low</i>

872
01:07:29,499 --> 01:07:33,993
<i>When the blood creeps and

873
01:07:34,071 --> 01:07:38,772
<i>And the heart is sick and
all the wheels of being slow</i>

874
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:45,513

876

Tennyson, "In Memoriam".
A beautiful poem.

877
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:52,483
Forgive me, I didn't
mean to startle you.

878
01:07:52,557 --> 01:07:54,787
Oh, no. No, no.
I borrowed this book.

879
01:07:54,859 --> 01:07:55,916
I hope you don't mind.

880
01:07:55,993 --> 01:07:58,963
Oh, no, no. Please,
this is your home now.

881
01:07:59,030 --> 01:08:00,292
You are safe here.

882
01:08:00,365 --> 01:08:02,925
My brother will find me.
He always does.

883
01:08:03,001 --> 01:08:04,126
How could he?

884
01:08:04,201 --> 01:08:05,693
Our location is a highly
classified secret.

885
01:08:05,771 --> 01:08:08,397
Yes, but I know of it now,
which means that he does, too.

886
01:08:08,473 --> 01:08:09,770
We're twins.

887
01:08:09,841 --> 01:08:13,402
Even as children, a link has
bound us one to the other.

888
01:08:14,579 --> 01:08:15,841
Something I cannot explain.

889
01:08:16,314 --> 01:08:17,507
No need.

890
01:08:20,385 --> 01:08:21,750
You look different.

891
01:08:21,819 --> 01:08:23,116
Oh, do I?

892
01:08:23,187 --> 01:08:24,380
Perhaps my hair?

893
01:08:24,454 --> 01:08:25,582
No.

894
01:08:25,658 --> 01:08:28,990
It's your eyes.
I can see your eyes.

895
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:33,326
Yes. Just trying
a new look.

896
01:08:37,735 --> 01:08:39,260
Is that a map?

897
01:08:40,905 --> 01:08:42,806
Yes, it was in the cylinder.

898
01:08:42,941 --> 01:08:44,873
There are no coordinates.

899
01:08:48,614 --> 01:08:50,843
Perhaps there's
a watermark.

900
01:08:53,852 --> 01:08:56,844
You were very brave
vouching for me.

901
01:08:56,922 --> 01:09:00,221
How do you know I'm not
the enemy, bringing me here?

902
01:09:01,326 --> 01:09:03,386
It's as you were
saying just now.

903
01:09:03,462 --> 01:09:07,990
From intuition maybe,
a link.

904
01:09:10,935 --> 01:09:13,997
Normally I'm able to
read others quite quickly,

905
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,474
but I've never met
anyone like you.

906
01:09:20,013 --> 01:09:21,604
Nor I, like you.

907
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:26,784
Good night, Abraham.

908
01:09:26,852 --> 01:09:28,376
Good night, Princess.
Your Highness.

909
01:09:28,454 --> 01:09:30,286
Your Majesty.
Your... Ma'am.

910
01:09:30,890 --> 01:09:32,048
Ma'am?

911
01:10:04,857 --> 01:10:06,951
<i>Gute Nacht,
Agent Hellboy.</i>

912
01:10:11,097 --> 01:10:13,895
Look, Agent,
I know you don't like me,

913
01:10:13,967 --> 01:10:15,695
but I could take
away your badge.

914
01:10:15,768 --> 01:10:17,669
Never had one.

915
01:10:17,737 --> 01:10:19,898
Kept asking, though.

916
01:10:19,973 --> 01:10:22,168
You will learn to
obey me, follow protocol

917
01:10:22,242 --> 01:10:24,369
and stay fockused
at all times.

918
01:10:24,444 --> 01:10:26,969
Oh, that word "fockused".

919
01:10:27,046 --> 01:10:30,141
Yeah, with your accent,
I wouldn't use it that much.

920
01:10:30,217 --> 01:10:32,206
I knew Professor Broom,
young man.

921
01:10:32,284 --> 01:10:33,513
You didn't know
Professor Broom.

922
01:10:33,586 --> 01:10:34,747
Yes, I did.

923
01:10:34,822 --> 01:10:36,186
- After my accident...
- Shut up. Shut up.

924
01:10:36,256 --> 01:10:37,884
...he designed
this containment suit.

925
01:10:37,958 --> 01:10:39,549
A wonderful man.

926
01:10:39,626 --> 01:10:41,025
And even then he was worried
about your future. He...

927
01:10:41,094 --> 01:10:42,959
Hey, Gas Bag, stop it!

928
01:10:44,799 --> 01:10:45,823
Right now.

929
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:48,163
Or what?
Are you threatening me?

930
01:10:48,368 --> 01:10:50,701
Because I think
I can take you.

931
01:10:53,206 --> 01:10:54,333
Excuse me?

932
01:10:54,475 --> 01:10:55,703
You heard me.

933
01:10:58,344 --> 01:11:01,439
I couldn't hear you
from all the way over there.

934
01:11:01,515 --> 01:11:05,280
I can take you because
you have one fatal flaw.

935
01:11:06,319 --> 01:11:07,412
Oh, I wanna hear it.

936
01:11:07,488 --> 01:11:09,820
No, you don't.
You can't take criticism.

937
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:11,586
Try me.

938
01:11:11,726 --> 01:11:13,418
Can't take it.

939
01:11:15,896 --> 01:11:17,762
What's my flaw?

940
01:11:17,833 --> 01:11:20,733
Your temper.
It gets the best of you.

941
01:11:20,835 --> 01:11:23,429
Makes you weak.
Makes you vulnerable.

942
01:11:27,542 --> 01:11:28,531
Oh, crap.

943
01:11:29,709 --> 01:11:30,870
Johann.

944
01:11:35,884 --> 01:11:38,681
Johann? Johann?

945
01:11:40,955 --> 01:11:42,651
Hey, Johann?

946
01:11:47,093 --> 01:11:49,529
Come on, pal.
Hang in there, will you?

947
01:11:49,598 --> 01:11:51,964
Johann? Johann?

948
01:11:56,136 --> 01:11:57,125
Damn.

949
01:12:40,482 --> 01:12:41,848
There we are.

950
01:12:41,918 --> 01:12:43,475
Your temper,
it makes you sloppy.

951
01:12:43,552 --> 01:12:45,520
Try to control it,
Agent Hellboy.

952
01:12:45,587 --> 01:12:47,487
Before it controls you.

953
01:12:55,931 --> 01:12:57,263
Glasshole.

954
01:13:28,798 --> 01:13:29,787
Hello, Red.

955
01:13:29,865 --> 01:13:31,093
Well, you're up late.

956
01:13:31,167 --> 01:13:32,362
What are you listening to?

957
01:13:32,435 --> 01:13:35,428
<i>Vivaldi.
Il cimento dell'armonia.</i>

958
01:13:35,505 --> 01:13:36,869
I particularly
like the last...

959
01:13:36,939 --> 01:13:38,270
Hey, hey. What's that?

960
01:13:38,341 --> 01:13:40,003
Just a remote.

961
01:13:42,512 --> 01:13:44,341
This? Yes.

962
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:48,483
Popular Love Songs.

963
01:13:51,688 --> 01:13:52,882
Oh, Abe.

964
01:13:53,956 --> 01:13:56,425
You fell for the Princess.

965
01:13:57,027 --> 01:13:59,621
She's... She's like me.

966
01:13:59,696 --> 01:14:02,027
A creature from
another world.

967
01:14:03,533 --> 01:14:05,967
You need to get out more.

968
01:14:06,036 --> 01:14:09,005
She's alone in the world.
I wanna help her.

969
01:14:09,072 --> 01:14:11,266
I need to care for her.

970
01:14:13,311 --> 01:14:15,607
You're in love.
Have a beer.

971
01:14:15,678 --> 01:14:16,668
Oh, my body's a temple.

972
01:14:16,747 --> 01:14:17,805
Well, now it's an
amusement park.

973
01:14:17,881 --> 01:14:18,870
No, no, no.

974
01:14:18,949 --> 01:14:19,939
The glandular balance of...

975
01:14:20,017 --> 01:14:22,211
Just shut up and
drink it, would you?

976
01:14:24,955 --> 01:14:27,048
- What track?
- Eight.

977
01:14:27,124 --> 01:14:29,685
<i>Can't Smile Without You.</i>

978
01:14:29,761 --> 01:14:31,090
I know.

979
01:14:31,227 --> 01:14:33,163
Yep, I'm gonna need
a beer, too.

980
01:14:33,231 --> 01:14:35,494
Well, see, I love this song.

981
01:14:35,565 --> 01:14:38,192
And I can't smile or cry.

982
01:14:38,267 --> 01:14:40,567
I think I have
no tear ducts.

983
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,965
I wish Father were here.

984
01:14:46,044 --> 01:14:49,103
He'd know what to tell
you... us.

985
01:14:57,055 --> 01:15:01,389
<i>I can't smile without you</i>

986
01:15:01,492 --> 01:15:06,087
<i>I can't laugh
and I can't sing</i>

987
01:15:06,765 --> 01:15:10,495
<i>I'm finding it hard
to do anything</i>

988
01:15:10,568 --> 01:15:16,473
<i>You see,
I feel sad when you're sad</i>

989
01:15:17,141 --> 01:15:21,510
<i>I feel glad when you're glad</i>

990
01:15:21,579 --> 01:15:26,379
<i>If you only knew
what I'm going through</i>

991
01:15:27,485 --> 01:15:34,221
<i>I just can't
smile without you</i>

992
01:15:36,426 --> 01:15:38,622
<i>You came along</i>

993
01:15:38,696 --> 01:15:40,927
<i>Just like a song</i>

994
01:15:40,999 --> 01:15:44,229
<i>And brightened my day</i>

995
01:15:44,302 --> 01:15:48,603
<i>Who'd have believed that
you were part of a dream?</i>

996
01:15:48,674 --> 01:15:54,010
<i>Now it all seems
light years away</i>

997
01:15:54,079 --> 01:16:00,244
<i>And now you know I can't
smile without you</i>

998
01:16:01,452 --> 01:16:05,412
<i>I can't smile without you</i>

999
01:16:06,924 --> 01:16:08,392
<i>Nuala.</i>

1000
01:16:18,636 --> 01:16:19,898
Good dog.

1001
01:16:30,616 --> 01:16:33,742
<i>Security detail
for the front gate, immediately.</i>

1002
01:16:52,638 --> 01:16:54,402
It's the last one.

1003
01:16:59,645 --> 01:17:03,082
Look at her.
She's it, Abe.

1004
01:17:03,683 --> 01:17:04,673
She's it.

1005
01:17:04,819 --> 01:17:06,751
She's my whole wide...

1006
01:17:09,055 --> 01:17:10,044
You know?

1007
01:17:11,691 --> 01:17:13,716
Yeah. Yeah.

1008
01:17:13,793 --> 01:17:16,192
I would give
my life for her.

1009
01:17:17,897 --> 01:17:20,627
But she also wants me
to do the dishes.

1010
01:17:22,001 --> 01:17:25,368
I would die
and do the dishes.

1011
01:17:25,438 --> 01:17:27,428
Why is she mad at me?

1012
01:17:27,506 --> 01:17:29,135
It's not because
the room is dirty.

1013
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:30,767
Something else.

1014
01:17:31,846 --> 01:17:34,335
Well, ask her, then.

1015
01:17:34,413 --> 01:17:36,315
No.

1016
01:17:36,584 --> 01:17:37,948
Listen, Abe.

1017
01:17:38,017 --> 01:17:39,006
Yeah.

1018
01:17:39,085 --> 01:17:41,018
When a woman's
mad about something,

1019
01:17:41,086 --> 01:17:42,987
but she's really mad
about something else,

1020
01:17:43,056 --> 01:17:46,891
you can't ask because then they
get angry because you had to ask.

1021
01:17:46,961 --> 01:17:48,393
Do you know what I mean?

1022
01:17:48,461 --> 01:17:50,827
Never mind,
don't answer that question.

1023
01:17:50,897 --> 01:17:52,593
You gotta just...

1024
01:17:53,466 --> 01:17:54,558
Yeah.

1025
01:17:55,568 --> 01:17:56,729
...find out.

1026
01:18:03,777 --> 01:18:05,574
Very quick of you.
The parchment.

1027
01:18:05,646 --> 01:18:07,408
It was of no importance.

1028
01:18:07,981 --> 01:18:12,180
The cylinder is
very interesting.

1029
01:18:17,258 --> 01:18:19,693
We will find
the Golden Army here.

1030
01:18:21,594 --> 01:18:24,758
As for the crown piece,
I know it's here.

1031
01:18:27,101 --> 01:18:29,695
I can feel that
much from you.

1032
01:18:31,105 --> 01:18:34,802
Father always tried so hard
to shield your heart from mine.

1033
01:18:38,279 --> 01:18:41,442
But it's in one of the books,
and I will find it.

1034
01:18:41,881 --> 01:18:43,076
Blue.

1035
01:18:43,517 --> 01:18:46,180
You always look
so beautiful in blue.

1036
01:18:47,588 --> 01:18:48,713
Blue.

1037
01:18:49,757 --> 01:18:51,953
Poetry. Love.

1038
01:18:53,027 --> 01:18:55,724
Found then lost.

1039
01:18:57,298 --> 01:18:59,790
Only words.
I will find it.

1040
01:19:01,702 --> 01:19:03,260
Listen, listen, Red.

1041
01:19:03,337 --> 01:19:06,739
I know what's
going on with Liz.

1042
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:08,240
Red.

1043
01:19:08,309 --> 01:19:09,833
Abe.

1044
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:12,439
I'm sorry.
He has to know.

1045
01:19:12,515 --> 01:19:13,605
Abe!

1046
01:19:13,681 --> 01:19:15,046
Know what?

1047
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:21,719
Why?

1048
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:23,621
Stay back.
I'll go first.

1049
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:27,219
Abraham. No, don't...
He'll kill you.

1050
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:28,660
Princess?

1051
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:30,095
Abraham?

1052
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,500
No!

1053
01:19:33,636 --> 01:19:35,363
I will kill you, Abraham.

1054
01:19:36,805 --> 01:19:39,273
And anyone else
if that is necessary.

1055
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:42,704
Well?

1056
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:49,008
Then why don't you just start
with me, Your Royal Assness?

1057
01:19:50,585 --> 01:19:51,984
Who put those there?

1058
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:53,646
And your weapon of choice?

1059
01:19:53,723 --> 01:19:56,212
Five-fingered Mary.

1060
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:59,556
You move and I'll kill
your Abraham first.

1061
01:20:10,773 --> 01:20:12,331
Red, you mustn't
harm the Prince.

1062
01:20:12,408 --> 01:20:13,534
What?

1063
01:20:13,609 --> 01:20:16,338
If you hurt him,
you hurt the Princess.

1064
01:20:17,746 --> 01:20:20,046
You've gotta be kidding me.

1065
01:20:25,086 --> 01:20:26,213
Will you give me
the crown piece?

1066
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:27,551
No.

1067
01:20:37,534 --> 01:20:39,193
- The piece.
- No.

1068
01:21:09,433 --> 01:21:10,422
Abe?

1069
01:21:10,501 --> 01:21:11,761
Red, I'm so sorry,
but they're linked.

1070
01:21:11,834 --> 01:21:13,061
What's going on?

1071
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:14,694
- Red.
- Liz.

1072
01:21:14,771 --> 01:21:16,533
Red, behind you.

1073
01:21:18,675 --> 01:21:22,041
You may have mused in the past,
"Am I mortal?"

1074
01:21:27,652 --> 01:21:29,049
You are now.

1075
01:21:35,660 --> 01:21:39,389
Abraham, many people
have died for this crown.

1076
01:21:40,965 --> 01:21:42,762
He will, too.

1077
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,869
If you want to save him
and see her again,

1078
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:53,502
you will find the missing
piece and bring it to me.

1079
01:22:30,314 --> 01:22:32,782
Jesus, Abe, pull the
damn thing out!

1080
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:34,078
I cannot.

1081
01:22:34,152 --> 01:22:37,518
Every time I touch it, every
time I come close to it,

1082
01:22:37,587 --> 01:22:39,556
it moves closer
to his heart.

1083
01:22:39,624 --> 01:22:41,353
I don't know
what else to do.

1084
01:22:41,425 --> 01:22:44,723
The wound will not heal
until the spear is removed.

1085
01:22:47,063 --> 01:22:48,429
We're running out of time.

1086
01:22:48,499 --> 01:22:50,331
Then we go after the Prince.

1087
01:22:51,770 --> 01:22:53,998
And we make him
take it out.

1088
01:22:55,941 --> 01:22:57,272
Hey, Liz.

1089
01:22:57,675 --> 01:22:58,836
You were asking me.

1090
01:22:58,911 --> 01:23:00,036
Don't talk.

1091
01:23:00,111 --> 01:23:01,669
No, no, let me tell you.

1092
01:23:01,746 --> 01:23:03,441
I know what's important.

1093
01:23:05,384 --> 01:23:06,442
It's you.

1094
01:23:06,518 --> 01:23:07,950
Red.

1095
01:23:08,452 --> 01:23:11,649
I could turn my back
on the world, all of it,

1096
01:23:14,825 --> 01:23:16,521
as long as you stay with me.

1097
01:23:16,595 --> 01:23:18,391
I'll stay with you.

1098
01:23:19,197 --> 01:23:21,665
You're the best man
I've ever met.

1099
01:23:27,071 --> 01:23:28,060
Man.

1100
01:23:55,067 --> 01:23:57,535
<i>Be near me
when my light is low</i>

1101
01:23:57,603 --> 01:23:59,037
<i>When the blood creeps</i>

1102
01:23:59,105 --> 01:24:04,099
<i>And the heart is sick and
all the wheels of being slow</i>

1103
01:24:10,650 --> 01:24:12,311
The cylinder
yielded coordinates

1104
01:24:12,384 --> 01:24:14,511
to County Antrim,
Northern Ireland.

1105
01:24:14,953 --> 01:24:18,116
The Giant's Causeway.
Right about here.

1106
01:24:19,792 --> 01:24:21,588
Great. So we know
where he is.

1107
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:22,685
What are we waiting for?

1108
01:24:22,762 --> 01:24:23,854
We should get going.

1109
01:24:23,930 --> 01:24:26,831
The Prince will demand the
crown piece, Agent Sherman.

1110
01:24:26,899 --> 01:24:28,559
So we give it to him.

1111
01:24:28,634 --> 01:24:30,033
Dr. Manning?

1112
01:24:30,102 --> 01:24:32,732
I'm afraid it's not
as simple as that.

1113
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:34,700
Hold on here,
what are you saying?

1114
01:24:34,773 --> 01:24:37,106
The Golden Army
must not awaken.

1115
01:24:38,244 --> 01:24:39,836
So, what?

1116
01:24:39,912 --> 01:24:42,278
You're just gonna let
him die, is that it?

1117
01:24:42,348 --> 01:24:43,406
I'm sorry.

1118
01:24:43,483 --> 01:24:45,883
We called Washington.
We have our orders.

1119
01:24:46,986 --> 01:24:49,250
And what about you?
He saved your life.

1120
01:24:49,322 --> 01:24:50,881
I know.

1121
01:24:53,994 --> 01:24:55,983
I know this is
difficult for you, but...

1122
01:24:56,061 --> 01:24:57,724
Well, I won't
let him die.

1123
01:24:57,798 --> 01:24:59,527
Agent Sherman,
may I remind you

1124
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:02,568
that I am the leader
of this team.

1125
01:25:02,634 --> 01:25:04,364
Oh, there's no doubt
about that, sir.

1126
01:25:04,437 --> 01:25:06,372
That is what you
are, Dr. Krauss.

1127
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:10,308
And if ever you were human,
that time is long gone.

1128
01:25:11,811 --> 01:25:13,780
What's wrong
with her?

1129
01:25:13,847 --> 01:25:15,007
You want me to
call her back, sir?

1130
01:25:15,082 --> 01:25:16,310
Let her go.

1131
01:25:16,517 --> 01:25:17,949
I understand.

1132
01:25:18,919 --> 01:25:20,716
What about you?

1133
01:25:20,788 --> 01:25:22,220
You find anything?

1134
01:25:22,288 --> 01:25:23,688
No. Nothing yet.

1135
01:25:23,757 --> 01:25:25,224
Well, keep looking.

1136
01:25:25,292 --> 01:25:26,692
Absolutely, sir.

1137
01:25:26,761 --> 01:25:28,488
All of you.

1138
01:25:28,561 --> 01:25:31,463
But don't worry, sir, we know
it's here, and we're gonna find it.

1139
01:25:31,532 --> 01:25:33,625
When Tom Manning gets on
the case, things get done.

1140
01:25:33,701 --> 01:25:35,930
They get done.
They get done!

1141
01:25:36,502 --> 01:25:39,438
100%. I guarantee that.

1142
01:25:55,189 --> 01:25:59,319
Even without the piece, we
have to get him out of here.

1143
01:25:59,393 --> 01:26:02,260
We'll go to Antrim, and
we will find the Prince.

1144
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:03,523
Keep looking.

1145
01:26:03,597 --> 01:26:04,621
I ask you, everybody,
keep looking.

1146
01:26:04,698 --> 01:26:05,688
Abe.

1147
01:26:09,303 --> 01:26:11,134
Just the two of us.

1148
01:26:11,839 --> 01:26:13,671
Yes. Yes.

1149
01:26:14,310 --> 01:26:15,606
Let's go.

1150
01:26:31,893 --> 01:26:35,294
We need to leave now, before
they run our clearance upstairs.

1151
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:37,830
<i>Guten Abend,
meine Freunde.</i>

1152
01:26:37,899 --> 01:26:40,460
Do you have authorization
to take that plane?

1153
01:26:41,869 --> 01:26:43,928
You're not gonna
stop us, Johann.

1154
01:26:44,004 --> 01:26:46,474
On the contrary,
I've been giving it some thought,

1155
01:26:46,542 --> 01:26:49,509
and we should be able
to save Agent Hellboy.

1156
01:26:50,344 --> 01:26:53,906
You say I'm not human anymore,
but you are wrong.

1157
01:26:53,982 --> 01:26:56,611
I understand your
pain all too well.

1158
01:26:56,685 --> 01:26:59,652
A long time ago,
I lost the woman I loved.

1159
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:03,282
And that was, in fact, the
source of my present misfortune.

1160
01:27:03,358 --> 01:27:04,986
I will tell you
about it one day.

1161
01:27:05,060 --> 01:27:07,995
But for now, the tactical
advantage is ours.

1162
01:27:08,063 --> 01:27:10,895
Consider this, the Prince
lacks the crown piece

1163
01:27:10,965 --> 01:27:13,560
and without it, his
army poses no threat.

1164
01:27:13,637 --> 01:27:15,068
So we have clearance, then?

1165
01:27:15,136 --> 01:27:18,766
Agent Sherman, Liz,
screw the clearance.

1166
01:27:19,441 --> 01:27:21,411
We will take that plane!

1167
01:27:45,402 --> 01:27:47,095
It should be here someplace.

1168
01:27:47,168 --> 01:27:51,195
The entrance should be here.

1169
01:27:51,272 --> 01:27:52,638
I don't understand.

1170
01:27:52,708 --> 01:27:55,269
Perhaps there's
a mistake on the map.

1171
01:28:00,583 --> 01:28:02,074
Hello there!

1172
01:28:04,119 --> 01:28:05,711
I bid you welcome, strangers.

1173
01:28:05,788 --> 01:28:07,311
How can I be of assistance?

1174
01:28:07,388 --> 01:28:09,483
We seek safe
passage to Bethmoora.

1175
01:28:10,126 --> 01:28:13,094
And what does a nice little girl
like you want in the nightlands?

1176
01:28:13,162 --> 01:28:14,993
We are looking
for Prince Nuada.

1177
01:28:15,064 --> 01:28:16,532
Him, I know.

1178
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:18,761
Trade me something,
and I'll take you to him.

1179
01:28:18,835 --> 01:28:21,166
Here. I have a shiny belt.

1180
01:28:21,303 --> 01:28:23,669
But I have no pants.

1181
01:28:23,739 --> 01:28:26,766
Look, a wonderful
set of magic eyes.

1182
01:28:26,843 --> 01:28:28,868
I already have binoculars.

1183
01:28:29,913 --> 01:28:34,872
But I see something special,
something shiny underneath the bandages.

1184
01:28:34,950 --> 01:28:36,418
I want that.

1185
01:28:36,486 --> 01:28:38,113
No, you can't take it out.

1186
01:28:38,188 --> 01:28:40,212
Not without killing him.

1187
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:43,455
Maybe I know someone
who can.

1188
01:28:43,528 --> 01:28:45,255
Will you trade me then?

1189
01:28:51,034 --> 01:28:52,229
All right.

1190
01:28:52,303 --> 01:28:53,530
Very well.

1191
01:30:05,443 --> 01:30:07,343
Keep going. Keep going.

1192
01:30:21,492 --> 01:30:23,186
Oh, my God.

1193
01:30:35,173 --> 01:30:38,370
You should have seen
this city when it was alive.

1194
01:30:40,746 --> 01:30:42,144
What happened to it?

1195
01:30:42,213 --> 01:30:43,202
Curse.

1196
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,546
As soon as the Golden
Army was stored here,

1197
01:30:45,618 --> 01:30:48,107
a plague of silence
and death befell us.

1198
01:30:48,185 --> 01:30:50,484
And the world left us behind.

1199
01:30:57,696 --> 01:31:00,632
For a long time,
I alone dwelled in the dust.

1200
01:31:03,902 --> 01:31:07,896
All right, little girl,
the two of you come inside.

1201
01:31:07,974 --> 01:31:10,271
The rest of you,
wait out here.

1202
01:31:26,092 --> 01:31:27,458
Hello, old friend.

1203
01:31:27,528 --> 01:31:29,357
I have brought you visitors.

1204
01:31:32,765 --> 01:31:35,757
And I have
a favor to ask you.

1205
01:31:35,835 --> 01:31:39,532
I owe no favor to
you, goblin. Leave.

1206
01:31:39,605 --> 01:31:41,596
But I have done
so much for you.

1207
01:31:41,741 --> 01:31:43,834
I have brought
you many souvenirs.

1208
01:31:44,745 --> 01:31:46,870
And he has something shiny.

1209
01:31:46,945 --> 01:31:48,106
Red.

1210
01:31:48,181 --> 01:31:49,307
Something mine.

1211
01:31:49,382 --> 01:31:50,371
Red!

1212
01:31:55,755 --> 01:31:58,417
Anung un Rama.

1213
01:31:58,491 --> 01:31:59,550
You know that name?

1214
01:31:59,626 --> 01:32:04,323
And yours.
Elizabeth Sherman.

1215
01:32:10,069 --> 01:32:12,799
At last.

1216
01:32:12,905 --> 01:32:18,865
I have been waiting for
you both many a winter moon.

1217
01:32:21,415 --> 01:32:25,010
I am his death,

1218
01:32:25,085 --> 01:32:29,953
and I will meet him
at each crossroads.

1219
01:32:30,022 --> 01:32:32,958
Good. But when can I have
that which is mine?

1220
01:32:34,161 --> 01:32:35,526
Can you save him?

1221
01:32:35,596 --> 01:32:38,087
It is for you to decide that.

1222
01:32:38,165 --> 01:32:40,099
It is all the same to me.

1223
01:32:40,167 --> 01:32:45,297
My heart is filled
with dust and sand,

1224
01:32:45,371 --> 01:32:49,673
but you should know
it is his destiny

1225
01:32:50,844 --> 01:32:54,007
to bring about the
destruction of the Earth.

1226
01:32:55,083 --> 01:33:01,509
Not now, not tomorrow,
but soon enough.

1227
01:33:06,226 --> 01:33:11,595
Knowing that, you still
want him to live?

1228
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:24,743
So, child, make the choice.

1229
01:33:24,812 --> 01:33:28,373
The world or him?

1230
01:33:29,017 --> 01:33:30,143
Him.

1231
01:33:31,987 --> 01:33:36,650
The time will come
and you, my dear,

1232
01:33:36,724 --> 01:33:39,989
will suffer more than anyone.

1233
01:33:40,061 --> 01:33:41,858
I'll deal with it.

1234
01:33:43,630 --> 01:33:45,120
Now save him.

1235
01:33:45,199 --> 01:33:48,761
It is done.

1236
01:33:53,641 --> 01:33:55,906
I have done what I can.

1237
01:33:56,011 --> 01:34:01,003
Now, give him
a reason to live.

1238
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:10,223
Hey, friend, what
about that which is mine?

1239
01:34:10,291 --> 01:34:14,022
Don't forget about me.
What about me?

1240
01:34:14,095 --> 01:34:15,427
Friend?

1241
01:34:25,707 --> 01:34:26,867
Shiny.

1242
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:35,478
Listen to me, you big ape.

1243
01:34:37,386 --> 01:34:39,684
You have to get up.

1244
01:34:42,457 --> 01:34:44,221
You have to get up.

1245
01:34:46,929 --> 01:34:49,329
'Cause you're
gonna be a father.

1246
01:35:07,217 --> 01:35:08,876
I become

1247
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:12,509
father?

1248
01:35:24,668 --> 01:35:27,465
Well, all this is
very touching,

1249
01:35:27,536 --> 01:35:32,531
but if you still want to meet
Nuada, we have to leave now.

1250
01:35:33,410 --> 01:35:34,434
Ready.

1251
01:35:42,484 --> 01:35:43,850
Here we are.

1252
01:35:45,455 --> 01:35:47,855
And there they are.

1253
01:35:47,924 --> 01:35:51,258
Seventy times 70 soldiers.

1254
01:35:51,827 --> 01:35:54,854
Sometimes I wish
I'd never created them.

1255
01:35:54,931 --> 01:35:56,523
Bim-bam went the hammers!

1256
01:35:56,599 --> 01:35:58,261
Whoosh went the furnaces!

1257
01:35:58,335 --> 01:36:01,930
And one of those fires
took my legs off, now.

1258
01:36:02,038 --> 01:36:04,872
This is as far as I can go.

1259
01:36:04,942 --> 01:36:07,502
I'm not very
good with steps.

1260
01:36:07,577 --> 01:36:12,447
But if you're here to stop him,
the Prince, I wish you luck then.

1261
01:36:12,516 --> 01:36:14,507
The Golden Army
must not awaken.

1262
01:36:14,585 --> 01:36:15,778
Undo what we did.

1263
01:36:15,852 --> 01:36:16,840
We will.

1264
01:36:36,239 --> 01:36:37,400
You're here.

1265
01:36:37,475 --> 01:36:39,636
So I assume you brought
the remaining piece.

1266
01:36:39,710 --> 01:36:41,540
No. We didn't,
but we should discuss...

1267
01:36:41,611 --> 01:36:43,909
I'm not addressing you,
Tin Man.

1268
01:36:44,982 --> 01:36:46,074
Abraham.

1269
01:36:46,150 --> 01:36:47,242
Abraham?

1270
01:36:47,318 --> 01:36:48,513
My sister is well
as I promised, so...

1271
01:36:48,587 --> 01:36:50,279
Abe?

1272
01:36:53,257 --> 01:36:55,419
What the hell are you doing?

1273
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:57,719
You would do
the exact same for Liz.

1274
01:36:57,794 --> 01:36:59,456
Agent Sapien, no!

1275
01:37:21,821 --> 01:37:25,312
I am Prince Nuada,
Silverlance,

1276
01:37:25,390 --> 01:37:27,415
leader of the Golden Army.

1277
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:32,157
Is there anyone here
who would dispute my right?

1278
01:38:51,344 --> 01:38:52,437
Kill them.

1279
01:38:52,512 --> 01:38:53,603
But...

1280
01:38:55,014 --> 01:38:56,538
He lied to us.

1281
01:38:58,517 --> 01:39:02,215
Abe, old buddy, if we ever
get out of this, we gotta talk.

1282
01:39:30,449 --> 01:39:31,780
Open wide!

1283
01:39:41,495 --> 01:39:43,520
Industrable, my ass.

1284
01:40:23,605 --> 01:40:25,868
Hey! Throw me a bone here!

1285
01:42:05,507 --> 01:42:06,838
Oh, crap.

1286
01:42:10,178 --> 01:42:12,079
Well,
I'm out of ideas.

1287
01:42:20,322 --> 01:42:21,846
I got one.

1288
01:42:21,924 --> 01:42:25,794
I challenge Prince Nuada

1289
01:42:27,295 --> 01:42:30,959
for the right to
command this army.

1290
01:42:36,772 --> 01:42:39,105
You challenge me?

1291
01:42:39,175 --> 01:42:40,699
Who are you
to challenge me?

1292
01:42:40,777 --> 01:42:42,245
You are nobody.

1293
01:42:43,112 --> 01:42:44,578
You are not royalty.

1294
01:42:44,645 --> 01:42:48,913
Yes. Yes! He is Anung un Rama,
son of the Fallen One.

1295
01:42:48,985 --> 01:42:50,043
He has the right.

1296
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:51,952
A challenge must
be answered.

1297
01:42:55,592 --> 01:42:57,082
Very well then.

1298
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:58,356
Red, please.
Red. Think about it.

1299
01:42:58,430 --> 01:42:59,417
- Guys. Guys!
- He will kill you.

1300
01:42:59,496 --> 01:43:01,258
Don't do this, Red.

1301
01:43:02,031 --> 01:43:04,157
Don't worry, babe.

1302
01:43:04,233 --> 01:43:06,465
I'm not gonna kill him, Abe.

1303
01:43:07,104 --> 01:43:09,094
But I am gonna
kick his ass.

1304
01:45:16,669 --> 01:45:17,760
Red.

1305
01:45:19,403 --> 01:45:20,393
Hey!

1306
01:45:28,747 --> 01:45:30,045
Nice ride, huh?

1307
01:46:10,056 --> 01:46:12,286
You jumpy, slippery bastard.

1308
01:46:13,526 --> 01:46:14,788
I got you now.

1309
01:46:24,437 --> 01:46:28,032
Kill me. You must,
for I will not stop.

1310
01:46:28,107 --> 01:46:29,700
- I cannot.
- Sorry, pal.

1311
01:46:31,079 --> 01:46:32,237
I win.

1312
01:46:33,211 --> 01:46:34,440
You live.

1313
01:47:05,279 --> 01:47:06,437
Nuala.

1314
01:47:34,909 --> 01:47:36,239
The humans,

1315
01:47:38,946 --> 01:47:41,277
they will tire of you.

1316
01:47:41,348 --> 01:47:43,179
They have already
turned against you.

1317
01:47:43,684 --> 01:47:44,846
Leave them.

1318
01:47:46,422 --> 01:47:49,082
Is it them or us?

1319
01:47:52,260 --> 01:47:54,660
Which holocaust
should be chosen?

1320
01:48:05,907 --> 01:48:09,809
I never had a chance
to tell you how I felt.

1321
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:12,741
Give me your hand.

1322
01:48:23,791 --> 01:48:25,384
It's beautiful.

1323
01:48:26,495 --> 01:48:27,825
We die

1324
01:48:30,030 --> 01:48:32,660
and the world will
be poorer for it.

1325
01:48:46,748 --> 01:48:48,944
Nuala, my sister.

1326
01:49:32,897 --> 01:49:33,987
All that power.

1327
01:49:34,062 --> 01:49:35,791
Don't even think about it.

1328
01:50:25,081 --> 01:50:26,640
No. No, it's nothing.

1329
01:50:26,717 --> 01:50:28,547
I told you,
it's a dead end.

1330
01:50:28,985 --> 01:50:31,351
What are you doing?
Go away.

1331
01:50:31,421 --> 01:50:33,321
Check the belt locator.

1332
01:50:34,425 --> 01:50:37,087
Check the belt locators,
over there.

1333
01:50:38,995 --> 01:50:40,485
Over there.

1334
01:50:44,168 --> 01:50:47,433
You, you took that plane without
an authorization, young man.

1335
01:50:47,504 --> 01:50:50,166
Hey. Manning.

1336
01:50:50,274 --> 01:50:52,367
Here to help as always.

1337
01:50:52,443 --> 01:50:54,843
What's going on?
What's going on?

1338
01:50:55,612 --> 01:50:56,840
I quit.

1339
01:50:57,815 --> 01:50:59,213
What? Are you serious?

1340
01:50:59,282 --> 01:51:00,648
Looks that way,
doesn't it?

1341
01:51:00,718 --> 01:51:03,551
What's wrong with you?
You can't all just quit.

1342
01:51:03,622 --> 01:51:04,951
Watch us.

1343
01:51:06,723 --> 01:51:08,386
On second thought,

1344
01:51:10,094 --> 01:51:11,721
I think I'll keep this.

1345
01:51:13,363 --> 01:51:15,594
Come on. Come on!

1346
01:51:16,901 --> 01:51:19,699
Johann, they can't do this.
Stop them.

1347
01:51:19,770 --> 01:51:23,206
Dr. Manning, suck my
ectoplasmic schwanzstucker.

1348
01:51:23,942 --> 01:51:25,239
So what you said before,

1349
01:51:25,310 --> 01:51:26,674
about us living anywhere.

1350
01:51:26,744 --> 01:51:27,904
Guys. Guys!

1351
01:51:27,978 --> 01:51:30,105
- Anywhere. You and me.
- Come on back.

1352
01:51:30,180 --> 01:51:31,204
Let's find a place
in the country.

1353
01:51:31,282 --> 01:51:32,442
I said come on back.

1354
01:51:32,516 --> 01:51:34,542
Clean air.
Green hills.

1355
01:51:35,488 --> 01:51:39,047
A yard with lots
of room to grow in.

1356
01:51:39,123 --> 01:51:39,608
It'll be great for the baby.

1357
01:51:40,524 --> 01:51:41,753
Babies.
