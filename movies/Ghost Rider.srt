1
00:00:54,973 --> 00:00:58,309
<i>It's said that the West was built on legends.</i>

2
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:02,313
<i>Tall tales that help us
make sense of things too great</i>

3
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,316
<i>...or too terrifying to believe.</i>

4
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:09,946
<i>This is the legend of the Ghost Rider.</i>

5
00:01:19,873 --> 00:01:23,918
<i>Story goes
that every generation has one.</i>

6
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:28,381
<i>Some damned soul,
cursed to ride the earth...</i>

7
00:01:28,548 --> 00:01:31,885
<i>...collecting on the devil's deals.</i>

8
00:01:34,846 --> 00:01:40,018
<i>Many years ago, a Ghost Rider was
sent to the village of San Venganza...</i>

9
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:45,857
<i>...to fetch a contract
worth 1000 evil souls.</i>

10
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:49,736
<i>But that contract was so powerful</i>

11
00:01:53,323 --> 00:01:58,036
<i>...he knew he could never let
the devil get his hands on it.</i>

12
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:03,208
<i>So he did what no Rider
has ever done before:</i>

13
00:02:08,505 --> 00:02:11,883
<i>He outran the devil himself.</i>

14
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:19,390
<i>The thing about legends is...</i>

15
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:22,894
. . <i>. sometimes they're true</i>

16
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,611
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

17
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:17,448
...the amazing, blazing...

18
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:21,035
<i>...stunt cycle spectacular!</i>

19
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:47,186
<i>How about a big round of applause
for Barton and Johnny Blaze?</i>

20
00:03:54,027 --> 00:03:55,612
<i>Let's hear it for them, folks!</i>

21
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,959
<i>You're a hotshot, ain't you, boy?</i>

22
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:13,504
Young, think you know everything
there is to know.

23
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:16,925
Think you're gonna live forever.
Is that about right?

24
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:20,637
- Come on, Dad. It was a patch of dirt.
- That's not the point.

25
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:25,266
Point is, we've been doing
this act less than a week.

26
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:26,809
You're already screwing around.

27
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:29,896
- I was just doing it for the crowd.
- We both know why you done it.

28
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:36,736
You think she's gonna stand by you
when you're in a wheelchair?

29
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:41,866
Huh, hotshot?

30
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:55,380
Son, everything you do in life, every
choice you make has a consequence.

31
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:58,091
When you do things
without thinking...

32
00:04:58,508 --> 00:05:01,052
...you ain't making the choice,
the choice is making you.

33
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:04,055
- You understand that?
- Yeah, sure.

34
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:07,350
What?

35
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,728
I said, "Yes, sir."

36
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:47,056
Hey, Dad, you think maybe I could take
Grace for a ride sometime?

37
00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:48,933
Think you're man enough
for Grace?

38
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,852
Hell, yeah.

39
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,855
Well, I don't.

40
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:57,775
Hey, Johnny.

41
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:01,738
Hey, Roxie.

42
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:09,412
Go on.

43
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:34,604
H9)'-

44
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:38,983
What's wrong, Roxie?

45
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,321
I'm leaving.

46
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,239
What?

47
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,658
My dad's sending me
to live with my mom.

48
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:54,332
- When?
- Soon.

49
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:58,252
What about us?

50
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:01,005
He says
you're not good enough for me.

51
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:03,049
That you're just a phase.

52
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:07,345
So what are we gonna do, Johnny?

53
00:07:10,723 --> 00:07:15,019
We'll leave. We'll jump on the bike
and just keep going.

54
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:18,022
But what about your dad?
What about the show?

55
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:21,192
He doesn't need me.
He doesn't need anybody.

56
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,779
Tomorrow, noon. We'll meet here.

57
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:51,824
What time is it?

58
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:54,410
It's late.

59
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:10,801
Where you going?

60
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,474
Nowhere, Dad.

61
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:19,644
I'm going nowhere.

62
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:53,761
Far out

63
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:03,854
- Johnny Blaze.
- Yeah.

64
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:06,607
Caught your show today.

65
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:12,029
Just wanted to tell you how much
I enjoyed watching you ride.

66
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:13,364
Oh, thanks.

67
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:16,409
Perhaps you'd ride for me one day.

68
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:18,452
You run a show?

69
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:21,372
Greatest show on earth.

70
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:28,462
Thanks, but no thanks.

71
00:10:33,384 --> 00:10:35,219
What's wrong, Johnny?

72
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:38,764
Worried about your father?

73
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:42,852
What do you know about that?

74
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,813
Even a blind man
could see he's sick.

75
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,776
Thing about cancer
is the time it takes...

76
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:53,571
...the toll on the loved ones.

77
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:56,365
Lives that are altered.

78
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:01,078
Plans that have to be changed.

79
00:11:03,581 --> 00:11:05,249
Johnny...

80
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:08,586
...what if I could help your dad?

81
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:11,756
Yeah? How?

82
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:14,467
How is not important.

83
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:17,762
What if I could make him better?

84
00:11:19,055 --> 00:11:21,432
Give him back his health?

85
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:24,977
Would you be willing
to make a deal?

86
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:29,982
Name your price.

87
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:35,613
I'll take...

88
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:41,285
.your soul.

89
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,459
Okay.

90
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:53,964
By sunrise tomorrow, your father
will be healthy as a horse.

91
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:58,886
And you will have your whole life
ahead of you.

92
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:01,764
It's your choice, Johnny.

93
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,976
All you have to do is sign.

94
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:34,422
Oh, that'll do just fine.

95
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,181
Damn.

96
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:49,603
Morning, sleeping beauty.

97
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:51,397
Dad?

98
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:55,151
- You look--
- Great, right?

99
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:58,612
Least that's what the doc said when
he looked at my x-rays this morning.

100
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,074
- What are you talking about?
- I've been sick, son.

101
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:04,702
When I finally get up
the nerve to tell you about it...

102
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:06,412
...I'm not any more.

103
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:10,541
I can't explain it.
But I feel healthy as a horse.

104
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,836
Now, come on, hotshot.
I got a show to do.

105
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:27,475
Biggest crowd of the week. Hey,
you know what I was thinking about?

106
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:30,936
A new stunt.
Put us over the top!

107
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:33,981
Be a jump: me on one side,
you on the other.

108
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:39,653
Instead of the cars or the ring of fire,
a helicopter.

109
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,656
Yeah. That'd be pretty cool,
don't you think?

110
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:46,994
Hey, you got two minutes to get
in your suit, son, or you're...

111
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,043
Roxanne's dad
is sending her away.

112
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,670
If we don't leave now,
it will be too late.

113
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:01,634
Well, that's great, boy. That's great.
Two kids on the run with nothing.

114
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:05,054
If your goal is to end up together,
that'll make sure it doesn't happen!

115
00:14:05,221 --> 00:14:07,848
I'd rather take my chances
with her than to waste my whole life...

116
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,934
...jumping bikes
at some stupid carnival.

117
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:15,022
Dad, I want something better
than that.

118
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:23,280
Her old man will have the cops on you
before you get to county line.

119
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,741
I guess I'd better get going then.

120
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,754
Hey, hotshot.

121
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:48,180
You take Grace.

122
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:57,398
At least you'll have
a good head start.

123
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:12,121
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Barton Blaze!</i>

124
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:45,571
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
head for the exits.</i>

125
00:15:45,738 --> 00:15:47,281
<i>Please stay calm.</i>

126
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:51,869
Dad? Dad, it's all right, I'm here.
I'm here, it's gonna be okay.

127
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:53,037
Dad?

128
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:59,084
Dad? Dad?

129
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:58,060
You're no good to me dead.

130
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:14,660
You. You killed him.

131
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:17,454
I cured his cancer.

132
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:20,332
That was the deal.

133
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,670
But I couldn't let him
come between us.

134
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:26,630
You son of a bitch.

135
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:31,677
One day, when I need you...

136
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,471
...I will come.

137
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:37,975
Until then, I'll be...

138
00:17:39,143 --> 00:17:41,186
I'll be watching.

139
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:45,107
Forget about friends.

140
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:48,652
Forget about family.

141
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:51,822
Forget about love.

142
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,706
You're mine, Johnny Blaze.

143
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:52,049
<i>You can't live in fear.</i>

144
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:54,927
<i>You can't live in fear.</i>

145
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:03,477
<i>Johnny, Johnny!
Johnny, Johnny!</i>

146
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:05,646
<i>Johnny, Johnny!</i>

147
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,211
Johnny Blaze!

148
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,296
Yeah, Johnny! Yeah!

149
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:26,268
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

150
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:29,563
<i>...please stay off the field
to allow paramedics through.</i>

151
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:32,232
Oh, God. Oh, God. JB!

152
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,950
JB, talk to me, man!

153
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:49,875
Heck, is the bike okay?

154
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,880
Yeah. Yeah.

155
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:58,342
Bike's fine. Oh, God.

156
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:02,095
Thank you.

157
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:04,681
Let's go home.

158
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:08,226
<i>Let's hear it for him, folks.</i>

159
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:12,022
<i>The amazing Johnny Blaze!</i>

160
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,194
Johnny, you gave us all a big scare.
What happened out there tonight?

161
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:20,572
Hey, JB don't do interviews,
all right? I'm sorry. Excuse me.

162
00:21:39,383 --> 00:21:40,634
Yeah, come on, come on.

163
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:44,054
Get the front end down. Damn it.

164
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:45,389
<i>Blaze is down.</i>

165
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:48,392
- Have you tried not crashing?
- Have you?

166
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:53,522
Why don't you have a beer
and relax like everybody else, huh?

167
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:55,816
You know alcohol
gives me nightmares.

168
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,446
To each his own.

169
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:09,663
Oh, wait, could you go back?

170
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:13,375
There's a howler monkey special
on Discovery Channel tonight.

171
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:16,086
<i>- Guys, hey.
- We've seen big moves and crashes.</i>

172
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:19,006
<i>But ask these riders
who it is they look up</i> to...

173
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:22,843
<i>...and the answer's a man who's not
even competing here, Johnny Blaze.</i>

174
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:25,470
Yeah, that's because he's right here!

175
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:27,305
<i>--Greatest stunt rider of all time...</i>

176
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:30,767
<i>...but what we don't know is how
much longer can Blaze cheat death.</i>

177
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:33,770
<i>- Critics call it pay-per-view suicide--
- Put the monkey show on.</i>

178
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:36,106
Mack, the monkey show?

179
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:38,025
<i>--With no regard for his own life.</i>

180
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:41,570
<i>They call him Mr. Invincible,
and he'/I have to be at his next jump...</i>

181
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:43,739
<i>...when Johnny Blaze
will attempt to clear...</i>

182
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:46,950
<i>...the length of a football field
from field goal to field goal.</i>

183
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,293
What?

184
00:22:57,753 --> 00:23:02,632
"What." You should be taking
a dirt nap after that ragdoll today.

185
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:04,551
I got lucky.

186
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:08,764
No, I got a hunting dog named Lucky.
He's got one eye and no nuts.

187
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:13,310
Luck don't cover it, JB. Man, you got
an angel looking after you.

188
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:16,063
- Yeah, maybe.
- Mack, you in?

189
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:19,733
Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.

190
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,778
Scoot over, ladies.
What's the ante?

191
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:24,196
Five card draw.

192
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:26,656
Maybe it's something else.

193
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,246
There you go.

194
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:16,873
Took you long enough.

195
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:43,900
I think you might be lost, boy.

196
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:45,861
You deaf or something?

197
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:48,572
Angels only in there.

198
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:51,366
Angels. Really?

199
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:55,579
Yeah, really.
You got a problem with that?

200
00:24:57,581 --> 00:24:58,915
As a matter of fact...

201
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:17,434
...I do.

202
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:30,280
Yep.
Love your neighbourhood, Johnny.

203
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:32,866
Real friendly around here.

204
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:42,459
Oh, I see you still haven't gotten
a lock for your lift. That's great, great.

205
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:46,463
You've got a lot of expensive bikes
in here, I told you. How many times?

206
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:50,592
Well, JB, I said it before,
I'll say it again:

207
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,719
This place could use a woman's touch.

208
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:56,473
- So could you.
- Heard that.

209
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:02,646
All right, four out of five. Wreck
one more and you get the whole set.

210
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:09,319
Well, I'm glad to see
you found use for your books.

211
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:10,987
You want some jellies?

212
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:14,074
No. I don't want
none of your stupid candy.

213
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:21,331
I wanna talk to you about
something kind of serious.

214
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:22,666
I'm trying to relax, Mack.

215
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:26,086
Yeah, I understand. All right?
It's just gonna take a second.

216
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:35,136
It's about you jumping on the
anniversary of your dad's accident.

217
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:41,184
Can I just turn this music off
for a minute?

218
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:44,187
<i>I want you to kick higher for me.
Can you get higher?</i>

219
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:46,189
This jump, man, we--

220
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:47,816
<i>Come on! Hit it!</i>

221
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:52,028
Mack, you touch the Carpenters
or that chimp video again...

222
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:56,324
...and we got a scrap on our hands.
- This jump is nuts. All right, man?

223
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:59,452
I mean, field goal to field goal,
and now you're adding cars?

224
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,622
I mean, what are you
trying to prove?

225
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:04,958
That it's me.

226
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:06,710
That it's you?

227
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:08,545
Riding the bike.

228
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:11,840
Of course it's you, man.
Who the hell else is it gonna be?

229
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:13,883
You know what,
you're freaking me out.

230
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,219
You're freaking me out
because you're reading...

231
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:19,264
...this comparative exponential
religiosity crap.

232
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:21,391
It's getting in your brain.

233
00:27:23,226 --> 00:27:25,228
I mean, what's going on, man?

234
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:28,857
Do you believe
people get second chances?

235
00:27:29,316 --> 00:27:30,567
I-- I don't know.

236
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:34,738
If somebody makes a mistake,
a big mistake...

237
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:37,365
...do you think that person
should have to pay for it...

238
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:39,701
...every day
for the rest of their lives?

239
00:27:40,243 --> 00:27:42,662
Are you talking about
your daddy's accident?

240
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:45,665
Well...

241
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:49,544
I'm just looking for a sign.

242
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:51,921
What kind of sign?

243
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:56,718
That I can take a negative
and turn it into a positive.

244
00:27:56,885 --> 00:27:58,928
That I can have a second chance too.

245
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:05,727
JB, what happened way back when
to your daddy was not your fault.

246
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:08,271
You know that, right?

247
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:16,696
Look, at least promise me
you'll think about taking the cars out.

248
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:19,032
I'll think about it.

249
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:13,169
I knew you were here.
I could smell your fear.

250
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:30,395
Hello, Gressil.

251
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:34,482
Why are you here?

252
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,031
Wallow.

253
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:48,872
And what do you want from us?

254
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:51,499
I've come for the contract
of San Venganza.

255
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:55,587
Legend has it that the contract
was stolen and hidden...

256
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:57,714
...in a graveyard not far from here.

257
00:29:57,881 --> 00:29:59,716
And now you're gonna help me find it.

258
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:06,139
Abigor.

259
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:08,766
And when we find it, then what?

260
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:10,602
Then we'll take this world...

261
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:13,480
...one city...

262
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:16,399
...at a time.

263
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:17,817
Blackheart!

264
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:41,674
- What the hell are you doing here?
- It's my time now, old man.

265
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:46,429
Your time will come.
But not now.

266
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:48,598
We both know
you can't harm me here.

267
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:53,895
I'm not like you. I've never fallen.
I never will.

268
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:59,776
I may not have power over you
in this world, but my Rider does.

269
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:03,571
The Ghost Rider?

270
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:07,450
Your favourite creation?

271
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:12,038
The power of hellfire
wasted on a pathetic human?

272
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:14,165
If you had trusted me...

273
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:17,001
...if you had given me
what was rightfully mine--

274
00:31:17,168 --> 00:31:21,589
It's all mine.
Until the end of days.

275
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:25,593
Go ahead.

276
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:28,304
Send the Rider.

277
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:30,473
I'll bury him.

278
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:32,934
And then I'll bury you.

279
00:31:33,643 --> 00:31:34,936
Father.

280
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:53,371
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
the Johnny Blaze Leap of Death!</i>

281
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:58,876
Yeah!

282
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:05,925
Johnny B!

283
00:32:14,475 --> 00:32:15,935
Hey, JB.

284
00:32:16,728 --> 00:32:18,563
You're stepping on Karen.

285
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:25,987
What was it
you were gonna say, Mack?

286
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:29,574
I just ran a second check
on the ramps. They look good.

287
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:33,411
Crowd's kind of out of control.

288
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:37,540
Johnny, you know
you don't have to do this, don't you?

289
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:42,920
Does this suit fit all right?
Feels a little loose.

290
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:45,548
Suit's fine.

291
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:49,093
Would you bring me my hat, Mack?
Thank you.

292
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:57,977
You can't live in fear.

293
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:02,607
All right, we're up here on the right.

294
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:04,692
Mr. Blaze. Amy Page, event publicity.

295
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:07,445
- Have time for a quick interview?
- I don't know how long...

296
00:33:07,612 --> 00:33:10,531
...you been doing your job,
but Johnny Blaze don't do interviews.

297
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:12,575
Not even for an old friend?

298
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:25,296
<i>Hey, Johnny.</i>

299
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:30,927
Hi.

300
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:34,222
I'll do it.

301
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:36,432
Makeup.

302
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:40,812
He's good.

303
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:45,525
Oh, you're looking at the suit.

304
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:49,862
I know it's silly, but the fans
like it, so I keep on wearing it.

305
00:33:50,822 --> 00:33:54,200
- What about the cane?
- I need support.

306
00:33:54,492 --> 00:33:56,828
No. It's part of the costume.

307
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:03,000
Okay, and ready
in five, four, three, two...

308
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:04,627
How's your dad?

309
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:09,132
Johnny Blaze, thank you for talking
to us before your big jump.

310
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:12,343
No one has ever attempted
such a distance before:

311
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:15,430
Three hundred feet
from field goal to field goal.

312
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:17,849
What's going through your mind
right now?

313
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:21,394
You look really good.
I've seen you on TV.

314
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:25,148
You know, I watch a lot of TV
and you do a really good job.

315
00:34:27,942 --> 00:34:30,987
Johnny, what drives somebody
to risk their life for entertainment?

316
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:32,572
I heard you got married.

317
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:36,951
Oh, no. No, it didn't happen.

318
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:38,995
No?

319
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:44,709
Most of the time the press focuses on
the crashes, the broken bones...

320
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:46,210
...the costs of what you do.

321
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:48,296
Are there any other costs?

322
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:50,173
<i>--Commemorating this
epic milestone...</i>

323
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:52,842
<i>...in the life of
the world's greatest stuntman.</i>

324
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:56,763
<i>And remember, 40 percent
of all proceeds tonight...</i>

325
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,848
<i>- Yeah.
-...go to the Barton Blaze Foundation...</i>

326
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:02,185
<i>...dedicated to helping those in need
here in our home state...</i>

327
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:03,728
Okay, well...

328
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:06,981
Thank you for this revealing peek
into the life of Johnny Blaze.

329
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:10,193
I'm Roxanne Simpson, on scene.

330
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:11,778
And we're out.

331
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:16,365
- You're gonna stay for the jump, right?
- You know, we gotta get back.

332
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:18,868
Plus, I never liked watching you jump.

333
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:26,793
- Please.
- Let's go, guys.

334
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:28,377
Roxanne?

335
00:35:35,218 --> 00:35:39,472
- Come on, just one signature.
- You need to get back to your seat.

336
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,059
- You don't have to push.
- All right.

337
00:35:43,226 --> 00:35:46,729
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say
you two had some kind of history.

338
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:48,689
That was it, Mack.

339
00:35:49,232 --> 00:35:50,566
The sign.

340
00:35:50,858 --> 00:35:52,068
The sign?

341
00:35:54,403 --> 00:35:57,031
- Sure you don't wanna stick around?
- No.

342
00:35:57,198 --> 00:35:58,908
It hasn't started yet.

343
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:00,910
I'll buy you a doughnut.

344
00:36:01,536 --> 00:36:03,579
Come on, Roxie, it's Johnny Blaze.

345
00:36:04,247 --> 00:36:05,373
Let's go.

346
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,917
Thank God you listened to me,
took the cars out.

347
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:10,253
It would've been suicide otherwise.

348
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:12,713
This way if you come up short, see...

349
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,592
...you'll come down
on some nice, soft, green...

350
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:20,263
...grass.

351
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:24,267
<i>Johnny Blaze will not be jumping
50 cars today as scheduled...</i>

352
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:28,980
<i>...but instead will be leaping
six UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters.</i>

353
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:33,276
<i>Never before has any man attempted
such a death-defying stunt.</i>

354
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:35,987
I took the cars out.

355
00:36:41,784 --> 00:36:43,619
Why? Why, JB?
Why wouldn't you tell me?

356
00:36:43,786 --> 00:36:46,622
- Because you would have thrown a fit.
- Call me old-fashioned...

357
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:49,750
...I'm funny that way. Human sacrifice
makes me uncomfortable.

358
00:36:51,085 --> 00:36:53,379
Why, JB? Why helicopters, man?

359
00:36:54,422 --> 00:36:57,341
<i>You know what I've been
thinking about? A new stunt.</i>

360
00:36:57,508 --> 00:37:00,469
But instead of the cars
or the ring of fire...

361
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:02,847
...a helicopter.

362
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:07,310
My dad thought it'd be cool.

363
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:12,773
- He was right.
- Yeah.

364
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:15,484
Okay. Okay. This is the deal, man.

365
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:18,404
Halfway down the ramp I want you
to hit the NOS, okay?

366
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:19,864
Do not hit the NOS too early.

367
00:37:20,031 --> 00:37:22,575
If you hit it too early, you are screwed.
You got that?

368
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,453
Hey, JB, where's your head at, man?

369
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:29,957
She's probably on the interstate
by now, huh?

370
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:38,841
How much NOS
did you put in the tanks?

371
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:42,011
Enough to shame the space shuttle.
Chief, go ahead.

372
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:53,648
Oh, God. He ain't gonna make it.

373
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:14,377
He made it!

374
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:19,882
I told you he'd make it! Yeah, JB!

375
00:38:20,049 --> 00:38:21,968
<i>Let's hear it for him,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

376
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:25,638
<i>Three hundred feet! A world record,
as only Johnny Blaze can do!</i>

377
00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:39,443
Yeah! Yeah!

378
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:47,284
Where's he going?

379
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:50,371
I'll say one thing about the guy,
he's got guts.

380
00:38:50,538 --> 00:38:53,499
I mean, the other day I was watching
this, like, sports show--

381
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:56,627
Stuart, can you please stop talking
about Johnny Blaze already?

382
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:02,550
Yeah, that might be a little hard.

383
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:07,054
I made it!

384
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:12,351
- Pull over!
- Do you want me to pull over?

385
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:14,603
- Drive.
- Driving.

386
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:25,197
Come on, Roxie,
I need to talk to you.

387
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:36,667
What's your name?

388
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:39,128
- What?
- What's your name?

389
00:39:39,295 --> 00:39:40,963
Oh, Stuart!

390
00:39:41,714 --> 00:39:43,299
- Johnny.
- Hi.

391
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:45,634
Well, Stuart,
can you help me out here?

392
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,680
Sorry, dude. She's the boss.

393
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:53,726
Johnny, look out!

394
00:40:03,152 --> 00:40:06,655
All right, I guess I see
how it's gonna be. Hang on!

395
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:27,635
Howdy. Howdy, howdy, howdy.

396
00:40:27,802 --> 00:40:29,804
Are you trying to kill yourself?

397
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:33,349
I wanna talk to you.
I haven't seen you in 56,000 years.

398
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:35,142
This is crazy. You are crazy.

399
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:37,645
I don't have time for this,
I have a story to edit.

400
00:40:37,812 --> 00:40:39,188
You could have said no.

401
00:40:40,523 --> 00:40:44,193
When they asked you to interview me,
you could have said no.

402
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:48,614
- Move your van out of the way!
- What are you trying to say?

403
00:40:48,781 --> 00:40:51,909
Well, I'm not trying to say anything.
I'm saying that means something.

404
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:56,038
- Sorry!
- Don't mind them, they're fine.

405
00:40:56,205 --> 00:40:58,290
We are on the side of the freeway.

406
00:40:58,457 --> 00:41:02,002
Let's get some dinner.
You still like Italian?

407
00:41:04,964 --> 00:41:07,716
What's this about, Johnny?
You want some closure?

408
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:11,470
Look, you were 17 and you witnessed
a tragedy and you ran.

409
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:13,639
I understand now
like I understood then...

410
00:41:13,806 --> 00:41:15,724
...and I have no hard feelings, none.

411
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:19,770
That's why they call it the past, because
it's passed. It's done, it's over with.

412
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:28,237
Too much?

413
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:36,787
There's a restaurant in my hotel,
the Plaza. Eight o'clock.

414
00:41:37,121 --> 00:41:38,330
Yes!

415
00:41:41,834 --> 00:41:43,085
Don't be late.

416
00:41:43,252 --> 00:41:45,296
This is a sign, Roxanne.

417
00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:47,423
There are no accidents.

418
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:49,592
Destiny and all that.

419
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:51,468
Johnny!Johnny!Johnny!

420
00:41:51,635 --> 00:41:54,054
- Can you please sign my sister's book?
- Oh, sure.

421
00:41:54,221 --> 00:41:55,264
-300 feet.
- We love you.

422
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:56,849
Well, thank you.

423
00:41:57,016 --> 00:41:59,185
Three hundred feet.
Pretty neat, pretty neat.

424
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:00,603
Right on, Johnny.

425
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:08,277
Thank you.

426
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:32,801
You can't live in fear.

427
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:35,846
You can't live in fear.

428
00:42:37,014 --> 00:42:39,475
You made that jump.
No one else made that jump

429
00:42:39,642 --> 00:42:41,518
You're the best rider.

430
00:42:44,647 --> 00:42:47,191
You deserve a second chance.

431
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:49,652
She's a sign.

432
00:43:08,212 --> 00:43:10,464
<i>Johnny.</i>

433
00:43:33,696 --> 00:43:35,197
Thank you.

434
00:43:38,325 --> 00:43:39,535
Okay.

435
00:44:10,357 --> 00:44:13,944
<i>Johnny.</i>

436
00:44:55,569 --> 00:44:56,737
You.

437
00:44:57,988 --> 00:44:59,615
Hello, Johnny.

438
00:45:00,449 --> 00:45:02,326
Stay away from me.

439
00:45:02,868 --> 00:45:04,536
Little late for that.

440
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:07,623
Nice bike.

441
00:45:10,042 --> 00:45:11,627
Why are you here?

442
00:45:11,794 --> 00:45:15,422
Oh, I've always been here, Johnny.

443
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:16,840
All along.

444
00:45:17,466 --> 00:45:18,967
Phoenix...

445
00:45:19,134 --> 00:45:20,344
...Denver...

446
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,762
...Houston.

447
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:25,349
It was you. Keeping me alive.

448
00:45:25,516 --> 00:45:27,601
No. No, Johnny.

449
00:45:27,768 --> 00:45:29,269
It's all you.

450
00:45:30,104 --> 00:45:31,772
You're the best.

451
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:35,150
And I'm your greatest fan.

452
00:45:35,776 --> 00:45:39,154
The posters, the video games...

453
00:45:39,321 --> 00:45:43,909
...the crowds screaming, chanting:

454
00:45:44,076 --> 00:45:45,327
"Johnny.

455
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:47,788
Johnny.

456
00:45:49,206 --> 00:45:50,791
Johnny?

457
00:45:52,626 --> 00:45:54,711
It makes me so proud.

458
00:45:56,463 --> 00:45:59,842
It's like watching an investment...

459
00:46:00,008 --> 00:46:03,137
...that keeps growing and growing...

460
00:46:03,303 --> 00:46:07,349
...until the day you cash it in.

461
00:46:08,475 --> 00:46:10,978
That day is today, Johnny.

462
00:46:11,687 --> 00:46:14,857
Find the one known as Blackheart...

463
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:17,234
...and destroy him.

464
00:46:17,401 --> 00:46:19,194
Find him yourself.

465
00:46:20,446 --> 00:46:21,738
Doesn't work like that.

466
00:46:22,531 --> 00:46:25,284
You're under contract, remember?

467
00:46:27,202 --> 00:46:28,829
If you succeed...

468
00:46:29,872 --> 00:46:32,458
...I'll return your soul.

469
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:35,169
Yeah, I'm not doing it.

470
00:46:35,502 --> 00:46:37,713
You don't have any choice.

471

H9)'-

472
00:47:52,871 --> 00:47:55,499
You can't come in here.
This is private...

473
00:47:59,127 --> 00:48:00,254
---property.

474
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,422
There was a cemetery here.

475
00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:04,967
Yeah, a long time ago.

476
00:48:06,176 --> 00:48:08,053
What happened to the graves?

477
00:48:10,097 --> 00:48:11,515
They moved them.

478
00:48:12,266 --> 00:48:13,267
Where?

479
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,022
- I don't know.
- Who would?

480
00:48:21,483 --> 00:48:23,986
Saint Michael's church.

481
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,655
They're in charge of the whole thing.

482
00:48:27,364 --> 00:48:29,533
Look, you really shouldn't be here.

483
00:48:32,077 --> 00:48:34,079
That's what they keep telling me.

484
00:48:54,474 --> 00:48:55,726
God!

485
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:01,208
Looking for someone?

486
00:50:03,043 --> 00:50:04,753
Back to hell.

487
00:50:05,796 --> 00:50:09,174
We're not gonna have a meaningful
conversation now, are we?

488
00:50:09,508 --> 00:50:11,593
You're going down.

489
00:50:13,095 --> 00:50:14,346
I don't think so.

490
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:03,979
He ain't so tough.

491
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:14,614
Hey. Dirtbag.

492
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:28,420
Have mercy.

493
00:51:28,587 --> 00:51:31,798
Sorry. All out of mercy.

494
00:51:45,896 --> 00:51:48,690
Help me!

495
00:52:51,253 --> 00:52:52,712
Wait.

496
00:52:52,921 --> 00:52:54,840
You think I'm pretty, right?

497
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:01,763
Oh, God.

498
00:53:06,935 --> 00:53:07,978
Give me the damn bag!

499
00:53:08,353 --> 00:53:09,604
Help!

500
00:53:11,731 --> 00:53:12,983
Help!

501
00:53:24,786 --> 00:53:25,954
Thanks.

502
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:31,459
You.

503
00:53:31,793 --> 00:53:32,961
Guilty.

504
00:53:38,133 --> 00:53:40,802
Look into my eyes.

505
00:53:48,018 --> 00:53:51,521
Your soul is stained
by the blood of the innocent.

506
00:53:53,523 --> 00:53:55,400
Feel their pain.

507
00:53:55,567 --> 00:54:00,196
No!

508
00:54:06,578 --> 00:54:07,662
Give me your wallet!

509
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:13,251
Let me go!

510
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:51,975
Morning, bonehead.

511
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,840
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

512
00:57:06,007 --> 00:57:09,010
I feel like my skull's on fire,
but I'm good. Thanks for the water.

513
00:57:09,177 --> 00:57:10,178
Did you see my bike?

514
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:13,556
Did I say something funny?

515
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:15,058
Ironic.

516
00:57:15,391 --> 00:57:18,019
We're big on irony around here.

517
00:57:19,104 --> 00:57:21,940
- It's out by the shed.
- Thanks.

518
00:57:22,107 --> 00:57:23,608
It does.

519
00:57:24,818 --> 00:57:25,819
What?

520
00:57:25,985 --> 00:57:29,572
You're wondering if your bike
looks normal? It does.

521
00:57:30,365 --> 00:57:32,033
And to answer your other questions:

522
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,035
Last night did happen...

523
00:57:34,202 --> 00:57:35,954
...it wasn't a dream...

524
00:57:36,454 --> 00:57:38,581
...and it will happen again.

525
00:57:39,415 --> 00:57:40,792
Who are you?

526
00:57:41,876 --> 00:57:45,213
Question is, who are you?

527
00:57:46,631 --> 00:57:49,926
You are the Rider.
The Ghost Rider.

528
00:57:51,261 --> 00:57:54,180
Get used to it, kid.
It'll be a lot easier.

529
00:57:54,347 --> 00:57:57,350
If you don't, I got a nice cosy spot
picked out for you.

530
00:58:11,072 --> 00:58:14,701
They've seen you now.
They'll be waiting for you.

531
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:18,538
You'll need my help,
you expect to last the night.

532
00:58:18,788 --> 00:58:22,167
Last time I let a stranger help me
it didn't pan out so good.

533
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:25,128
This ain't something
you can run from, kid.

534
00:58:25,545 --> 00:58:27,964
This day has been coming
since you made that deal.

535
00:58:37,724 --> 00:58:39,601
Congratulations.

536
00:58:39,767 --> 00:58:42,770
Your chances
just went from none to slim.

537
00:58:43,646 --> 00:58:46,774
Sources close to the investigation
say that there may be a link...

538
00:58:46,941 --> 00:58:49,027
...between what happened
here in downtown...

539
00:58:49,194 --> 00:58:51,487
...and the Broken Spoke massacre
in the desert.

540
00:58:51,654 --> 00:58:53,573
I'm Roxanne Simpson on scene.

541
00:58:54,365 --> 00:58:55,700
And we're out.

542
00:58:57,619 --> 00:58:58,828
- Captain Dolan.
- No comment.

543
00:58:58,995 --> 00:59:01,748
Is it true they found a connection
between the massacre...

544
00:59:01,915 --> 00:59:04,584
...and last night's victim
here at the city train yards?

545
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,215
No comment.

546
00:59:12,634 --> 00:59:13,801
Off the record, captain.

547
00:59:17,472 --> 00:59:19,182
Off the record?

548
00:59:19,474 --> 00:59:20,475
Piss off.

549
00:59:25,897 --> 00:59:28,358
The Rider is the devil's bounty hunter.

550
00:59:30,193 --> 00:59:33,655
Sent to hunt down anyone
that escapes from hell.

551
00:59:34,447 --> 00:59:36,658
Sterilize that for me.

552
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:38,701
Sterilize.

553
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:46,084
In the boiling water.

554
00:59:46,793 --> 00:59:48,294
Right. Okay.

555
00:59:49,629 --> 00:59:51,631
Little confused.

556
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:54,801
During the day you'll be normal.

557
00:59:55,468 --> 00:59:56,928
But at night...

558
00:59:58,388 --> 01:00:00,306
...in the presence of evil...

559
01:00:01,099 --> 01:00:02,892
...the Rider takes over.

560
01:00:04,143 --> 01:00:05,812
I remember now.

561
01:00:06,354 --> 01:00:07,605
Last night.

562
01:00:11,067 --> 01:00:14,570
There was some punk...

563
01:00:14,737 --> 01:00:18,157
...and I could see all the wrong
he'd ever done...

564
01:00:18,658 --> 01:00:20,994
...and I turned it all against him.

565
01:00:21,619 --> 01:00:23,496
The Penance Stare.

566
01:00:24,998 --> 01:00:27,458
It sears the souls of the wicked.

567
01:00:28,668 --> 01:00:31,504
It's the Ghost Rider's greatest weapon.

568
01:00:31,671 --> 01:00:33,631
All the Riders have it.

569
01:00:35,508 --> 01:00:40,680
Have there been others
with my Ghost Rider problem?

570
01:00:41,014 --> 01:00:42,515
Been a few.

571
01:00:42,682 --> 01:00:45,351
Last one was 150 years ago...

572
01:00:46,352 --> 01:00:49,230
...in a little town
called San Venganza.

573
01:00:50,523 --> 01:00:51,899
Nice town.

574
01:00:52,942 --> 01:00:54,527
Nice people.

575
01:00:54,694 --> 01:00:57,822
Till a stranger came along
making promises...

576
01:00:58,531 --> 01:01:00,366
...one deal at a time.

577
01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:05,038
Consumed by greed,
they turned on one another...

578
01:01:05,413 --> 01:01:10,001
...until the village of San Venganza
drowned in its own blood...

579
01:01:10,418 --> 01:01:14,964
...their souls trapped forever
in that godforsaken place.

580
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:17,592
What's this have to do
with Blackheart?

581
01:01:19,927 --> 01:01:21,262
Blackheart?

582
01:01:23,431 --> 01:01:25,433
He sent you after Blackheart?

583
01:01:26,225 --> 01:01:27,560
And others.

584
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,270
The Hidden.

585
01:01:30,855 --> 01:01:36,194
Fallen angels cast out of heaven
by Saint Michael himself.

586
01:01:36,861 --> 01:01:42,116
They hide within the elements
waiting for the end of days.

587
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:47,705
You better hang around here, kid.

588
01:01:49,874 --> 01:01:52,502
They can't come
onto hallowed ground.

589
01:01:54,462 --> 01:01:55,463
Thanks.

590
01:01:56,089 --> 01:01:57,382
And thanks for the info.

591
01:01:57,548 --> 01:02:00,635
I feel much better now that I know
I'm the devil's bounty hunter.

592
01:02:04,389 --> 01:02:07,433
- Where you going?
- Somebody I gotta see.

593
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,435
That's a bad idea.

594
01:02:11,145 --> 01:02:12,980
Wouldn't be my first.

595
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:18,694
Why'd you do it?

596
01:02:21,656 --> 01:02:23,491
Why'd you make the deal?

597
01:02:24,158 --> 01:02:25,535
I was a kid.

598
01:02:26,285 --> 01:02:28,121
What'd you get in return?

599
01:02:33,334 --> 01:02:34,919
Heartache.

600
01:02:45,805 --> 01:02:48,516
Captain. Captain!

601
01:02:49,517 --> 01:02:51,769
Forensics on the bikers
and the station manager...

602
01:02:51,936 --> 01:02:54,188
...suggest the same cause of death.

603
01:02:55,648 --> 01:02:57,108
Sulphur poison?

604
01:02:57,275 --> 01:03:00,361
- I didn't think sulphur was toxic.
- It is, in massive doses.

605
01:03:00,528 --> 01:03:02,864
And these guys were swimming in it.

606
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:05,032
Could be the work
of a chemical attack.

607
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:07,076
Or a religious nut.

608
01:03:07,243 --> 01:03:10,121
Hey. I know you. I've seen--

609
01:03:11,747 --> 01:03:15,710
Okay? There's nothing here
to suggest any kind of religious m.o.

610
01:03:15,877 --> 01:03:17,879
- Sulphur?
- What about it'?

611
01:03:18,045 --> 01:03:19,797
Ever read the Old Testament?

612
01:03:22,592 --> 01:03:23,885
Brimstone.

613
01:03:24,552 --> 01:03:26,220
There you go.

614
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:33,978
Oh, my God.

615
01:03:42,236 --> 01:03:45,406
It's hard to describe the destruction
here this morning.

616
01:03:45,573 --> 01:03:47,825
Can I get you people
to stand back, please?

617
01:03:47,992 --> 01:03:51,537
I don't know. It seems like
something supernatural.

618
01:03:51,704 --> 01:03:53,915
Could you tell us about
the Good Samaritan?

619
01:03:54,081 --> 01:03:56,417
Well, I'll never forget him,
that's for sure.

620
01:03:56,918 --> 01:04:01,422
He was tall, broad shoulders,
and thin, really thin, like bony.

621
01:04:01,589 --> 01:04:05,384
And he had this rad chopper,
it was all flames and stuff.

622
01:04:05,551 --> 01:04:10,765
Oh, and his face was a skull
and it was on fire.

623
01:04:14,435 --> 01:04:15,853
"On fire."

624
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:17,605
Yeah, like:

625
01:04:20,191 --> 01:04:21,776
Like that much fire.

626
01:04:21,943 --> 01:04:25,279
And I know it sounds weird,
but it looked okay on him.

627
01:04:25,446 --> 01:04:29,450
I mean, it was an edge look
but he totally pulled it off.

628
01:04:31,369 --> 01:04:32,995
Not sure what to add to that.

629
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:37,124
I'm Roxanne Simpson on scene.

630
01:04:38,709 --> 01:04:39,710
Thanks.

631
01:04:47,552 --> 01:04:49,303
- Roxie--
- Don't.

632
01:04:49,971 --> 01:04:52,515
Now, hold on a second.
Let me apologise.

633
01:04:52,682 --> 01:04:55,685
- Last night was inexcusable.
- No apologies.

634
01:04:55,851 --> 01:04:58,729
See, you did me a favour last night...

635
01:04:58,896 --> 01:05:01,399
...because you made me think
of then and now.

636
01:05:01,566 --> 01:05:04,068
And when you left,
yeah, it hurt like hell.

637
01:05:04,235 --> 01:05:06,529
But you know what? I got over it...

638
01:05:06,904 --> 01:05:09,907
...and I went to college,
I got a great job.

639
01:05:10,533 --> 01:05:12,159
But you, Johnny...

640
01:05:12,827 --> 01:05:14,412
...you're just the same.

641
01:05:15,288 --> 01:05:17,999
Oh, better paid, more fans...

642
01:05:18,165 --> 01:05:20,167
...but you're still just a carny.

643
01:05:25,756 --> 01:05:26,841
Yeah.

644
01:05:27,842 --> 01:05:29,176
Oh, man.

645
01:05:30,011 --> 01:05:31,679
My dad was right.

646
01:05:31,846 --> 01:05:33,431
You were just a phase.

647
01:05:40,521 --> 01:05:42,064
That went well.

648
01:05:47,111 --> 01:05:49,447
Hey, captain! I got something.

649
01:06:48,297 --> 01:06:50,007
"End of days.

650
01:06:54,762 --> 01:06:58,599
The host can gain control
of the possessing spirit...

651
01:06:58,766 --> 01:07:03,104
...through concentration on
and manipulation of...

652
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:07,024
...the fire element
that exists within man."

653
01:07:17,618 --> 01:07:20,871
I am speaking to the fire element
within me.

654
01:07:22,456 --> 01:07:26,627
Give me control
over the possessing spirit.

655
01:07:48,899 --> 01:07:50,109
- Hi.
- Hi.

656
01:07:50,276 --> 01:07:53,237
Hey, I hope you don't mind.
Your lift was open.

657
01:07:56,741 --> 01:07:58,701
I came to apologise.

658
01:07:59,076 --> 01:08:01,454
I'm leaving town tonight...

659
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:06,417
...and I didn't want what I said today
to be the last words between us.

660
01:08:06,751 --> 01:08:09,795
- That's okay.
- No, it's not.

661
01:08:10,921 --> 01:08:14,508
It was cruel and totally untrue.

662
01:08:14,675 --> 01:08:16,343
And I feel really terrible about it.

663
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:18,888
Please, don't. It's okay.

664
01:08:21,682 --> 01:08:22,683
Is something burning?

665
01:08:24,101 --> 01:08:28,105
Oh, that must be coming from outside.
Neighbour's hibachi.

666
01:08:28,272 --> 01:08:29,398
Bill, he just got it

667
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:31,317
I still have that one.

668
01:08:32,067 --> 01:08:33,068
You what?

669
01:08:35,696 --> 01:08:37,782
I have that one, too.

670
01:08:46,582 --> 01:08:48,626
I remember that day.

671
01:08:50,044 --> 01:08:51,962
There were a dozen people
waiting in line...

672
01:08:52,129 --> 01:08:54,381
...and you went through
a whole roll of quarters.

673
01:08:55,049 --> 01:08:58,010
Look at my face.
You can tell I was just terrified...

674
01:08:58,177 --> 01:09:01,055
...that my dad was gonna
come in any second.

675
01:09:15,945 --> 01:09:17,446
Okay, I just--

676
01:09:19,573 --> 01:09:22,910
It's just-- I think I should
walk you to your car.

677
01:09:26,247 --> 01:09:28,290
See, it's not great timing.

678
01:09:32,503 --> 01:09:34,588
You almost kill yourself
on the highway...

679
01:09:34,755 --> 01:09:37,091
...so you can ask me out
and then you don't show.

680
01:09:37,258 --> 01:09:38,968
Then you keep my picture...

681
01:09:39,134 --> 01:09:42,304
...but when I kiss you, you try to
shove me out the door. What's--?

682
01:09:42,471 --> 01:09:43,931
What's going on?

683
01:09:45,766 --> 01:09:48,310
Don't you care about me at all,
Johnny?

684
01:09:48,477 --> 01:09:52,606
You know you can talk to me.
You can tell me anything.

685
01:09:54,358 --> 01:09:55,693
Please.

686
01:09:58,612 --> 01:10:00,155
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

687
01:10:03,951 --> 01:10:05,119
Try me.

688
01:10:05,286 --> 01:10:06,871
You'll think I'm crazy.

689
01:10:07,204 --> 01:10:08,664
Maybe I am crazy.

690
01:10:08,831 --> 01:10:10,082
I hope I'm crazy.

691
01:10:10,249 --> 01:10:13,544
In my job, I've seen and heard
just about everything.

692
01:10:13,878 --> 01:10:17,298
So there is nothing you can tell me
that's gonna surprise me.

693
01:10:18,215 --> 01:10:19,383
Off the record?

694
01:10:20,634 --> 01:10:21,844
Yeah.

695
01:10:34,398 --> 01:10:36,400
I sold my soul to the devil.

696
01:10:43,741 --> 01:10:45,868
And now I have to spare you.

697
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:48,996
Spare me from what?

698
01:10:49,163 --> 01:10:51,498
The devil,
on account of I work for him.

699
01:10:51,665 --> 01:10:53,876
That's why I couldn't make it to dinner.

700
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:58,088
Because you were
working for the devil?

701
01:10:58,255 --> 01:11:00,341
Well, yeah. I'm his bounty hunter.

702
01:11:00,507 --> 01:11:04,053
But it only happens at night,
like it is right now.

703
01:11:04,219 --> 01:11:05,512
Whenever I'm around evil.

704
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:10,893
Evil people, evil spirits.
I change into...

705
01:11:12,519 --> 01:11:13,604
What?

706
01:11:14,772 --> 01:11:19,777
Just a great big monster,
but I am learning to--

707
01:11:19,944 --> 01:11:22,196
I'm getting control of it.

708
01:11:22,363 --> 01:11:23,822
I'm trying to.

709
01:11:25,824 --> 01:11:28,243
So tonight, you'll...

710
01:11:30,704 --> 01:11:31,914
I believe so.

711
01:11:32,081 --> 01:11:35,584
Which is why it's probably
a very good idea...

712
01:11:36,627 --> 01:11:39,129
...that you run on home now, Roxie.

713
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:44,635
You're serious.

714
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:52,643
So this is your excuse?

715
01:11:52,893 --> 01:11:57,064
For the past? For last night?
For everything?

716
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:10,494
The way I see it is
I've got a couple of choices:

717
01:12:11,745 --> 01:12:15,916
I could either accept that you really
believe what you're telling me is true...

718
01:12:16,083 --> 01:12:18,585
...and take you to
the nearest psychiatric hospital.

719
01:12:18,752 --> 01:12:19,753
You see, now that--

720
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:24,174
Or I realise that you'd rather
make up ridiculous stories...

721
01:12:24,341 --> 01:12:26,260
...than be honest with me...

722
01:12:27,052 --> 01:12:29,471
...and I walk out of that door...

723
01:12:29,763 --> 01:12:31,015
...forever.

724
01:12:57,624 --> 01:12:58,792
- Don't move!
- Hands up!

725
01:12:58,959 --> 01:13:02,129
Hands where we can see them!
Right over your head.

726
01:13:02,629 --> 01:13:04,048
Johnny Blaze.

727
01:13:05,382 --> 01:13:06,633
Yeah.

728
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:11,472
Captain Jack Dolan.
This is Officer Edwards.

729
01:13:12,598 --> 01:13:13,849
You're coming with us.

730
01:13:15,893 --> 01:13:17,186
Okay.

731
01:13:22,483 --> 01:13:24,234
<i>Let's try this again.</i>

732
01:13:24,818 --> 01:13:28,363
We have your plate and the tread
from your tyres at the crime scene.

733
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:30,824
We have a witness who will testify...

734
01:13:30,991 --> 01:13:33,494
...that the suspect
used some kind of fire effect.

735
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:36,747
An effect just like the ones
that you use in your stunt shows!

736
01:13:36,914 --> 01:13:41,168
Yeah. But I told you,
I didn't kill anybody.

737
01:13:49,218 --> 01:13:52,346
- What about him, you remember him?
- No.

738
01:13:52,596 --> 01:13:54,473
This guy was three years
from retirement...

739
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:56,016
...never harmed a fly.

740
01:13:56,183 --> 01:13:58,560
In fact, neither did
most of the corpses turning up...

741
01:13:58,727 --> 01:14:01,021
...since you came home,
you son of a bitch.

742
01:14:02,189 --> 01:14:04,525
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Bullshit!

743
01:14:04,691 --> 01:14:06,276
Okay, let's take a breather.

744
01:14:09,154 --> 01:14:10,989
- It's warm in here.
- Warm?

745
01:14:11,156 --> 01:14:12,991
Yeah, I'm burning up. Aren't you?

746
01:14:13,158 --> 01:14:14,368
A little.

747
01:14:17,079 --> 01:14:18,497
You want a cigarette?

748
01:14:18,997 --> 01:14:20,124
Okay.

749
01:14:20,874 --> 01:14:22,501
Mind if I do?

750
01:14:28,048 --> 01:14:29,216
Okay, that was weird.

751
01:14:32,386 --> 01:14:35,681
Look,Johnny,
I'm not asking for your help.

752
01:14:35,973 --> 01:14:38,892
I'm asking you to help yourself.

753
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:42,688
I watch a lot of TV
and I know what you're doing.

754
01:14:43,147 --> 01:14:46,859
Good cop, bad cop.
But you're both good cops.

755
01:14:47,568 --> 01:14:51,530
And you provide
a very, very important civil service.

756
01:14:51,697 --> 01:14:53,574
In fact, when I finish my stunt career...

757
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:57,244
...I intend to apply my skills
to being a motorcycle policeman.

758
01:14:57,411 --> 01:15:00,914
So I'd love to help you.
But I didn't kill anybody.

759
01:15:01,582 --> 01:15:03,750
Jesus Christ.

760
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:07,087
Who you trying to convince, Johnny?
Us or yourself?

761
01:15:07,254 --> 01:15:09,089
We're trying to help you here.

762
01:15:09,256 --> 01:15:12,301
We're trying to keep this thing quiet.

763
01:15:12,467 --> 01:15:15,929
Yeah, because I imagine that
your fans wouldn't be too keen...

764
01:15:16,096 --> 01:15:19,516
...on you being wrapped up
in a homicide investigation.

765
01:15:19,683 --> 01:15:24,271
Not to mention all those
corporate sponsors, event promoters...

766
01:15:27,482 --> 01:15:30,736
You ready to talk now, Johnny?

767
01:15:32,613 --> 01:15:34,698
Or do you want to spend
the night in the tank?

768
01:15:34,865 --> 01:15:37,075
Oh, I don't wanna do that.

769
01:15:37,492 --> 01:15:40,913
No, sir. I sure don't wanna do that.

770
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:46,126
But <i>I</i> didn't kill anybody.

771
01:15:47,461 --> 01:15:48,587
Damn it!

772
01:15:50,589 --> 01:15:53,592
You gotta let me go.
The real killer's out there.

773
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:57,095
- Lookie here.
- But you're making a mistake.

774
01:15:57,262 --> 01:15:58,597
What've we got?

775
01:15:59,306 --> 01:16:01,308
Come on, move your ass!

776
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:07,856
Blaze, riding up to meet us.

777
01:16:08,023 --> 01:16:11,401
Oh, God. Oh, please. Please,
you don't wanna put me in there.

778
01:16:11,568 --> 01:16:13,195
Sorry, the Ritz was booked.

779
01:16:19,117 --> 01:16:21,828
Oh, God.
Please, get me out of here!

780
01:16:24,665 --> 01:16:26,500
You look like that Johnny Blaze.

781
01:16:27,125 --> 01:16:30,963
Yeah, yeah, I hear that a lot.

782
01:16:31,505 --> 01:16:32,965
Nah, that is you.

783
01:16:33,131 --> 01:16:35,050
- That's him!
- Yeah, it is.

784
01:16:35,217 --> 01:16:38,470
I saw you jump in the state fair
a few years ago.

785
01:16:38,637 --> 01:16:41,348
I paid 10 bucks to watch you splatter.

786
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:45,269
But you didn't.

787
01:16:45,435 --> 01:16:47,271
Looks like somebody's tripping out.

788
01:16:47,562 --> 01:16:49,564
You might be a big shot
out there, Blaze...

789
01:16:49,731 --> 01:16:52,526
...but in here you're nothing
but a monkey in a cage!

790
01:16:52,693 --> 01:16:54,695
Now, I don't want any trouble.

791
01:16:54,861 --> 01:16:56,780
I don't want any trouble.

792
01:16:56,947 --> 01:16:59,241
Looks like trouble just found you.

793
01:17:00,867 --> 01:17:02,703
Nice jacket.

794
01:17:03,495 --> 01:17:04,955
Come on, man, leave him alone.

795
01:17:05,122 --> 01:17:06,123
Get lost!

796
01:17:06,290 --> 01:17:08,500
- The jacket's mine.
- Stop it!

797
01:17:43,285 --> 01:17:45,162
Nice jacket.

798
01:17:47,456 --> 01:17:49,249
Very nice.

799
01:18:09,061 --> 01:18:10,187
You.

800
01:18:12,522 --> 01:18:13,732
Innocent

801
01:18:45,389 --> 01:18:49,059
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

802
01:18:51,812 --> 01:18:53,480
I've sinned a lot.

803
01:19:16,878 --> 01:19:18,004
Hold it!

804
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:57,210
Where's the contract
of San Venganza?

805
01:19:57,377 --> 01:19:59,337
I don't know
what you are talking about.

806
01:19:59,504 --> 01:20:04,801
Don't lie to me! You've been protecting
it all these years, sworn to secrecy.

807
01:20:04,968 --> 01:20:07,179
Sworn to keep it
from the likes of you!

808
01:20:10,724 --> 01:20:12,559
There's an old saying:

809
01:20:12,934 --> 01:20:15,854
"Raise no more devils
than you can lay down."

810
01:20:16,021 --> 01:20:18,398
My father raised one too many.

811
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:28,783
<i>Calling all units. Reported 10-50
in the downtown</i> area.

812
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:29,993
<i>Proceed with caution.</i>

813
01:21:30,971 --> 01:21:32,472
He's coming for us.

814
01:21:32,806 --> 01:21:34,140
Abigor.

815
01:21:34,975 --> 01:21:36,309
You know what to do.

816
01:21:45,777 --> 01:21:48,405
<i>Rider.</i>

817
01:22:13,013 --> 01:22:16,933
I have a suspect fleeing west
on Cherry. Repeat, west on Cherry.

818
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:21,104
<i>- That's a dead end. You got him.
-10-4 on that.</i>

819
01:22:27,527 --> 01:22:29,029
<i>What's the suspect's location?</i>

820
01:22:29,195 --> 01:22:30,488
<i>- Up.
- What?</i>

821
01:22:30,655 --> 01:22:33,533
The suspect is going up.

822
01:22:53,219 --> 01:22:54,638
Oh, my God.

823
01:23:08,735 --> 01:23:10,070
People, help me.

824
01:23:10,236 --> 01:23:11,655
Go, go, go!

825
01:23:11,821 --> 01:23:14,741
Surround him!
Make a perimeter! Let's go!

826
01:23:26,086 --> 01:23:27,629
<i>Come in, please.</i>

827
01:23:41,226 --> 01:23:43,436
- Come here!
- No!

828
01:23:44,104 --> 01:23:46,022
You're pissing me off.

829
01:23:46,523 --> 01:23:47,941
Okay, okay.

830
01:23:48,108 --> 01:23:49,359
Sorry.

831
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:02,205
Take a right.

832
01:24:10,964 --> 01:24:12,966
You should've joined us, Rider.

833
01:24:13,133 --> 01:24:14,676
Soon we will have the contract...

834
01:24:14,843 --> 01:24:18,847
...and then you'll only be a footnote
in the history of the new hell.

835
01:24:22,809 --> 01:24:24,853
Time to clear the air.

836
01:24:37,782 --> 01:24:39,951
You're a slow learner,
aren't you, Rider?

837
01:24:41,494 --> 01:24:43,496
You cannot catch the wind!

838
01:24:54,883 --> 01:24:58,219
No!

839
01:25:32,879 --> 01:25:34,214
Oh, my God.

840
01:26:09,749 --> 01:26:11,125
Johnny.

841
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:19,092
Prepare to fire!

842
01:26:22,554 --> 01:26:23,805
- Fire!
- Don't!

843
01:27:30,163 --> 01:27:31,414
They know who I am.

844
01:27:31,998 --> 01:27:34,709
- Who's that?
- What? Everybody.

845
01:27:35,043 --> 01:27:37,170
You don't watch TV?
What's the matter with you?

846
01:27:41,174 --> 01:27:42,926
Is this thing ever gonna end?

847
01:27:43,092 --> 01:27:45,178
It'll end if you can catch him.

848
01:27:45,553 --> 01:27:47,013
What's really going on?

849
01:28:08,201 --> 01:28:10,870
- Anything good on?
- How can I help you, captain?

850
01:28:11,037 --> 01:28:12,497
Get out.

851
01:28:13,915 --> 01:28:16,626
We brought a friend of yours
in for questioning last night...

852
01:28:16,793 --> 01:28:19,587
...and now he seems
to have disappeared.

853
01:28:19,754 --> 01:28:22,715
Has Johnny Blaze tried
to contact you in any way, ma'am?

854
01:28:22,882 --> 01:28:25,051
Sorry. Can't help, guys.

855
01:28:29,389 --> 01:28:33,559
Look, I don't pretend to know
what the hell that thing is...

856
01:28:33,726 --> 01:28:36,187
...but I do know that Blaze
is wrapped up in it.

857
01:28:36,354 --> 01:28:41,025
And the only way you can save him
now is if you help us find him.

858
01:28:42,735 --> 01:28:47,323
You got six hours. After that we go
public with everything we got.

859
01:28:48,491 --> 01:28:49,909
Six hours.

860
01:29:04,757 --> 01:29:06,426
"Carter Slade."

861
01:29:07,427 --> 01:29:11,931
Legend has it he was
a Texas Ranger. Man of honour.

862
01:29:13,433 --> 01:29:15,101
But he got greedy.

863
01:29:15,435 --> 01:29:20,064
Found himself locked up,
waiting on the gallows.

864
01:29:20,732 --> 01:29:22,608
Stranger came to see him.

865
01:29:23,109 --> 01:29:24,861
Offering freedom.

866
01:29:25,862 --> 01:29:27,697
Slade made a deal.

867
01:29:28,448 --> 01:29:30,324
Ended up a Ghost Rider.

868
01:29:30,908 --> 01:29:32,618
What's he gotta do with this?

869
01:29:32,952 --> 01:29:34,912
Remember that contract
the stranger made...

870
01:29:35,079 --> 01:29:37,290
...with the people of San Venganza?

871
01:29:37,790 --> 01:29:42,128
The story goes that Slade
was sent there to collect all the souls.

872
01:29:43,212 --> 01:29:45,965
But what he found there was so evil...

873
01:29:46,132 --> 01:29:49,594
...that he took the contract
and rode off.

874
01:29:50,053 --> 01:29:51,763
He stole it.

875
01:29:52,096 --> 01:29:54,974
Keep Mephistopheles
from getting his hands on it.

876
01:29:55,808 --> 01:29:58,603
Some people say
he was buried with it.

877
01:29:58,770 --> 01:30:00,980
- Was he?
- I don't know.

878
01:30:02,148 --> 01:30:07,070
What I do know is that Blackheart is
coming, and he'll do anything to get it.

879
01:30:07,570 --> 01:30:11,532
That's why it's important for you to
stay away from friends and family...

880
01:30:11,699 --> 01:30:14,535
...anybody he can use against you,
because he will.

881
01:30:14,994 --> 01:30:15,995
Roxanne.

882
01:30:27,173 --> 01:30:28,424
Johnny?

883
01:30:34,597 --> 01:30:35,848
Johnny?

884
01:30:36,015 --> 01:30:37,225
God!

885
01:30:39,018 --> 01:30:40,353
Sorry! Sorry!

886
01:30:40,770 --> 01:30:42,146
Ma'am, you gave me a start.

887
01:30:42,855 --> 01:30:46,234
- I'm looking for Johnny.
- Yeah. You and me both.

888
01:30:47,026 --> 01:30:48,861
- Have you heard from him?
- No.

889
01:30:49,028 --> 01:30:50,988
But I heard he got in trouble.

890
01:30:52,281 --> 01:30:55,118
He got arrested, yeah? What for?

891
01:30:55,701 --> 01:30:59,247
Yeah, well, if this gets out in
the press, his career is over.

892
01:30:59,413 --> 01:31:02,208
Yeah, trust me, his career's
the least of it.

893
01:31:02,583 --> 01:31:05,503
You know, you seem like a nice lady,
and you're pretty and all...

894
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:08,214
...but we were riding the gravy train
on biscuit wheels...

895
01:31:08,381 --> 01:31:10,466
...then you showed up,
everything went to hell.

896
01:31:10,633 --> 01:31:13,261
So why don't you go back
to wherever it is you came from?

897
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:16,722
I can't go back. Not now.

898
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:19,559
Then tell me what the hell's going on!

899
01:31:20,309 --> 01:31:22,812
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

900
01:31:23,396 --> 01:31:26,065
Look, you don't know me...

901
01:31:26,232 --> 01:31:27,400
...but I love him.

902
01:31:27,567 --> 01:31:31,904
So if there's anything you know
that can help, anything...

903
01:31:34,866 --> 01:31:37,493
Lately, he's been reading
these really weird books...

904
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:39,412
...and they're messing with his mind.

905
01:31:39,579 --> 01:31:43,416
He's writing stuff down and staying up
late. And he does it over here.

906
01:31:43,583 --> 01:31:46,711
You can go through this stuff,
and I don't know if it means anything.

907
01:32:38,804 --> 01:32:40,973
This is hallowed ground.

908
01:32:50,066 --> 01:32:52,235
Did you think I was like
the others?

909
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:57,406
I have all of my father's strengths
and none of his weaknesses.

910
01:32:59,158 --> 01:33:01,786
The new hell is in San Venganza.

911
01:33:02,995 --> 01:33:04,997
I need the contract.

912
01:33:05,498 --> 01:33:07,416
I know it's here.

913
01:33:13,297 --> 01:33:15,174
Now give it to me.

914
01:33:25,268 --> 01:33:27,353
Give it to me.

915
01:33:28,771 --> 01:33:30,690
Give it to me.

916
01:33:30,856 --> 01:33:33,651
Give it to me. Give it to me.
Give it to me.

917
01:33:48,958 --> 01:33:50,960
You're gonna fall.

918
01:33:51,544 --> 01:33:53,629
Just like your father.

919
01:34:20,114 --> 01:34:23,367
The Rider, where is he?

920
01:34:23,784 --> 01:34:25,244
Gone!

921
01:34:30,583 --> 01:34:31,751
The girl.

922
01:34:32,084 --> 01:34:35,755
You hurt her, he'll be there
like lightning before the storm.

923
01:34:38,924 --> 01:34:40,551
I'm counting on it.

924
01:34:48,267 --> 01:34:49,393
Where's Roxanne?

925
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:51,771
Dude. Where've you been?
Everybody's out looking--

926
01:34:51,937 --> 01:34:55,024
- Where is she?
- She's out looking for you.

927
01:35:14,085 --> 01:35:15,252
Jesus.

928
01:35:15,419 --> 01:35:16,837
Not even close.

929
01:35:25,054 --> 01:35:26,639
You have his heart.

930
01:35:31,977 --> 01:35:33,854
Now I'm gonna break it.

931
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:37,441
Roxanne?

932
01:35:43,030 --> 01:35:44,198
Mack.

933
01:35:47,076 --> 01:35:48,077
Roxanne.

934
01:35:57,169 --> 01:35:59,296
Look into my eyes.

935
01:36:06,512 --> 01:36:09,014
Your Penance Stare
doesn't work on me.

936
01:36:09,181 --> 01:36:11,600
I have no soul to burn.

937
01:36:12,977 --> 01:36:15,980
I guess the Caretaker
forgot to mention that, huh?

938
01:36:16,355 --> 01:36:17,648
Surprise!

939
01:36:18,357 --> 01:36:20,067
He sent you to bring me back.

940
01:36:20,693 --> 01:36:22,570
I'm not going back.

941
01:36:22,736 --> 01:36:24,613
I like it here.

942
01:36:28,033 --> 01:36:29,827
He thinks you're better than me?

943
01:36:29,994 --> 01:36:33,205
I don't know who's more pathetic,
you or him.

944
01:36:36,125 --> 01:36:40,254
Now, listen to me. And try to get it
through that thick skull of yours.

945
01:36:40,421 --> 01:36:43,924
You don't work for my father any more.
You work for me.

946
01:36:44,258 --> 01:36:46,510
Get the contract from the Caretaker.

947
01:36:46,677 --> 01:36:51,682
Bring it to me in San Venganza
and maybe I'll spare your girl's life.

948
01:36:52,266 --> 01:36:53,726
And, Johnny...

949
01:36:58,564 --> 01:37:00,149
...don't make me wait.

950
01:37:19,001 --> 01:37:20,628
What happened?

951
01:37:22,296 --> 01:37:24,632
- Blackheart.
- They got her.

952
01:37:24,882 --> 01:37:27,384
Where's the contract?
I can't end this without it.

953
01:37:30,596 --> 01:37:33,599
Just gonna have to dig
this whole damn place up myself.

954
01:37:36,519 --> 01:37:37,895
It's not there, kid.

955
01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:52,076
Contract of San Venganza.

956
01:37:52,409 --> 01:37:53,911
Hell on earth.

957
01:37:56,330 --> 01:37:58,249
Now, you're gonna have to trust me.

958
01:37:59,083 --> 01:38:00,459
And why is that?

959
01:38:01,669 --> 01:38:03,671
He may have my soul...

960
01:38:05,047 --> 01:38:06,840
...but he doesn't have my spirit.

961
01:38:13,013 --> 01:38:16,809
Any man who's got the guts
to sell his soul for love...

962
01:38:17,101 --> 01:38:19,478
...got the power to change the world.

963
01:38:20,312 --> 01:38:22,147
You didn't do it for greed.

964
01:38:22,898 --> 01:38:24,942
You did it for the right reason.

965
01:38:25,776 --> 01:38:27,778
Maybe that puts God on your side.

966
01:38:28,571 --> 01:38:30,781
To him, that makes you dangerous.

967
01:38:30,948 --> 01:38:32,908
Makes you unpredictable.

968
01:38:33,576 --> 01:38:35,995
That's the best thing
you can be right now.

969
01:38:38,872 --> 01:38:42,001
San Venganza's 500 miles from here.

970
01:38:43,335 --> 01:38:45,004
We better get moving.

971
01:38:47,423 --> 01:38:48,674
"We"?

972
01:39:10,738 --> 01:39:13,324
I got one last ride left in me.

973
01:39:25,085 --> 01:39:26,670
Carter Slade.

974
01:39:30,841 --> 01:39:32,343
Can you keep UP?

975
01:39:41,101 --> 01:39:42,645
Let's ride.

976
01:40:27,231 --> 01:40:29,400
Stick to the shadows.

977
01:40:47,334 --> 01:40:49,837
This is the end of the trail for me.

978
01:40:50,421 --> 01:40:52,214
I got nothing left.

979
01:40:52,923 --> 01:40:56,719
I could only change one more time,
and I was saving it for this.

980
01:41:01,390 --> 01:41:04,393
God knows I've made
my share of mistakes.

981
01:41:05,561 --> 01:41:08,313
Been trying to make things right
ever since.

982
01:41:09,690 --> 01:41:14,236
Guess all I can do now is hope he
sees fit to give me a second chance.

983
01:41:14,987 --> 01:41:16,155
Thank you.

984
01:41:16,488 --> 01:41:18,073
No.

985
01:41:18,323 --> 01:41:19,867
Thank you, kid.

986
01:41:35,632 --> 01:41:37,634
The Rider is coming.

987
01:41:38,594 --> 01:41:41,263
Coming to save you.

988
01:41:42,181 --> 01:41:45,309
You think you can stop him?
Nothing can stop him.

989
01:41:45,851 --> 01:41:47,936
He's running out of time.

990
01:41:48,687 --> 01:41:49,980
I'll make sure of it.

991
01:41:54,276 --> 01:41:57,446
It's almost dawn. Slow him down.

992
01:41:59,406 --> 01:42:05,204
- What?
- Slow him down.

993
01:43:21,947 --> 01:43:23,115
Surprise.

994
01:44:37,731 --> 01:44:38,899
STOP.

995
01:44:39,066 --> 01:44:41,401
You change, she dies.

996
01:44:42,861 --> 01:44:43,862
Do it, Johnny.

997
01:44:52,162 --> 01:44:53,538
Let her go first.

998
01:45:50,804 --> 01:45:52,472
Looks like you're out of time.

999
01:46:24,296 --> 01:46:27,299
"This is the contract of San Venganza.

1000
01:46:30,886 --> 01:46:32,345
All of you...

1001
01:46:32,971 --> 01:46:35,640
...come to me!"

1002
01:47:31,530 --> 01:47:32,697
johnny!

1003
01:47:47,045 --> 01:47:50,715
My name is Legion...

1004
01:47:52,300 --> 01:47:54,177
...for we are...

1005
01:47:55,512 --> 01:47:59,558
...many.

1006
01:48:00,892 --> 01:48:03,562
Let's go. He got what he wanted.

1007
01:48:05,939 --> 01:48:10,443
You go. I gotta get him to
the shadows. I gotta end this.

1008
01:48:11,236 --> 01:48:13,029
Why? Why you?

1009
01:48:13,196 --> 01:48:16,074
It's been me since the day
I made the deal.

1010
01:48:16,241 --> 01:48:19,161
I'm the only one
who can walk in both worlds.

1011
01:48:19,661 --> 01:48:21,163
I'm Ghost Rider.

1012
01:48:25,625 --> 01:48:26,626
Run!

1013
01:48:37,262 --> 01:48:38,555
Come on, you son of a bitch.

1014
01:49:01,328 --> 01:49:02,621
All of your world...

1015
01:49:02,787 --> 01:49:04,664
...all of your souls...

1016
01:49:04,831 --> 01:49:07,500
...will be mine now.

1017
01:49:21,890 --> 01:49:23,642
- Throw me the gun!
- It's out!

1018
01:49:25,185 --> 01:49:26,353
Throw it!

1019
01:50:24,744 --> 01:50:28,164
How does it feel to have
all that evil inside of you?

1020
01:50:28,331 --> 01:50:29,749
All their power.

1021
01:50:30,875 --> 01:50:32,877
All their souls.

1022
01:50:33,753 --> 01:50:36,214
A thousand souls to burn.

1023
01:50:36,381 --> 01:50:39,009
Look into my eyes.

1024
01:50:39,175 --> 01:50:42,721
Your souls are stained
by the blood of the innocent.

1025
01:50:42,887 --> 01:50:44,764
No.

1026
01:50:44,931 --> 01:50:46,558
Feel their pain.

1027
01:50:57,819 --> 01:51:00,196
--Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

1028
01:51:00,363 --> 01:51:01,573
Kill you!

1029
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:06,411
Stop it!

1030
01:51:08,913 --> 01:51:10,165
Oh, God!

1031
01:51:50,622 --> 01:51:52,082
Monster.

1032
01:51:53,458 --> 01:51:55,043
I'm not afraid.

1033
01:52:20,110 --> 01:52:22,278
Congratulations, Johnny.

1034
01:52:23,696 --> 01:52:26,199
You upheld your end of the bargain.

1035
01:52:27,617 --> 01:52:30,829
It's time I take back
the power of the Ghost Rider.

1036
01:52:31,913 --> 01:52:33,748
You get your life back.

1037
01:52:34,666 --> 01:52:36,543
The love you've always wanted.

1038
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:39,421
You can start a family of your own.

1039
01:52:40,422 --> 01:52:42,632
There are more deals to be made.

1040
01:52:43,091 --> 01:52:47,679
More people willing to give their souls
for what they desire.

1041
01:52:48,096 --> 01:52:51,933
Let someone else carry this curse.
You're free now.

1042
01:52:53,184 --> 01:52:54,686
After all...

1043
01:52:55,437 --> 01:52:57,355
...a deal's a deal.

1044
01:53:10,326 --> 01:53:11,327
No.

1045
01:53:13,204 --> 01:53:15,707
I'm gonna own this curse...

1046
01:53:16,958 --> 01:53:19,461
...and I'm gonna use it against you.

1047
01:53:20,336 --> 01:53:22,964
Whenever innocent blood is spilt...

1048
01:53:23,465 --> 01:53:25,884
...it'll be my father's blood...

1049
01:53:27,552 --> 01:53:29,804
...and you'll find me there.

1050
01:53:30,305 --> 01:53:32,515
A spirit of vengeance...

1051
01:53:33,308 --> 01:53:36,269
...fighting fire with fire.

1052
01:53:37,687 --> 01:53:40,398
I will make you pay for this.

1053
01:53:41,357 --> 01:53:43,359
You can't live in fear.

1054
01:53:45,403 --> 01:53:47,530
No!

1055
01:54:10,762 --> 01:54:13,181
So where will you go now?

1056
01:54:14,432 --> 01:54:16,935
Wherever the road takes me, I guess.

1057
01:54:20,897 --> 01:54:24,859
My daddy once said, "if you don't
make a choice, the choice makes you."

1058
01:54:25,276 --> 01:54:29,447
Yeah. But why do your choices
always keep us apart?

1059
01:54:43,419 --> 01:54:45,588
Sure wish things could have
turned out different.

1060
01:54:47,131 --> 01:54:50,134
No. This is what you are.

1061
01:54:50,301 --> 01:54:52,971
This is what
you always were meant to be.

1062
01:54:53,721 --> 01:54:55,223
You got your second chance.

1063
01:54:55,974 --> 01:54:58,101
Go out there and make the best of it.

1064
01:55:26,588 --> 01:55:30,174
<i>It's said that the West
was built on legends...</i>

1065
01:55:31,467 --> 01:55:34,012
<i>...and that legends are
a way of understanding...</i>

1066
01:55:34,178 --> 01:55:36,806
<i>...things greater than ourselves.</i>

1067
01:55:37,140 --> 01:55:39,434
<i>Forces that shape our lives.</i>

1068
01:55:39,601 --> 01:55:43,021
<i>Events that defy explanation.</i>

1069
01:55:44,105 --> 01:55:47,817
<i>Individuals whose lives
soar to the heavens...</i>

1070
01:55:47,984 --> 01:55:49,986
<i>or fall to the earth</i>

1071
01:55:50,403 --> 01:55:53,948
<i>This is how legends are born.</i>
