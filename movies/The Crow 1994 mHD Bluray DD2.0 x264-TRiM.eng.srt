1
00:00:58,644 --> 00:01:01,939
<i>People once believed
that when someone dies...</i>

2
00:01:02,022 --> 00:01:05,525
<i>a crow carries their soul
to the land of the dead.</i>

3
00:01:06,443 --> 00:01:09,821
<i>But sometimes,
something so bad happens...</i>

4
00:01:09,905 --> 00:01:12,407
<i>that a terrible sadness
is carried with it...</i>

5
00:01:12,491 --> 00:01:14,284
<i>and the soul can't rest.</i>

6
00:01:15,285 --> 00:01:18,205
<i>Then sometimes-just sometimes-</i>

7
00:01:18,288 --> 00:01:22,709
<i>the crow can bring that soul back
to put the wrong things right.</i>

8
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:47,818
I got one here!

9
00:02:13,218 --> 00:02:15,345
Hey, Sarge.

10
00:02:15,429 --> 00:02:17,639
Yeah.

11
00:02:17,723 --> 00:02:22,269
Shelly Webster and Eric Draven.
Wedding was tomorrow night.

12
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:25,939
Who the fuck gets married
on Halloween anyhow?

13
00:02:26,023 --> 00:02:27,607
Nobody.

14
00:02:30,193 --> 00:02:33,113
- Sir, we gotta move her.
- Do it.

15
00:02:33,196 --> 00:02:35,449
All right, guys, let's do it.

16
00:02:35,532 --> 00:02:38,785
Devil's-fuckin'-Night.
What's the count so far?

17
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:40,203
143 fi res.

18
00:02:40,287 --> 00:02:42,080
They're slacking off from last year.

19
00:02:42,164 --> 00:02:44,958
Three hours to go.
Maybe they're just slow starters.

20
00:02:45,042 --> 00:02:46,626
Corning through!

21
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:54,343
I really empathize, but you guysjust can't
come in here and take her away like this.

22
00:02:54,426 --> 00:02:55,886
There are procedures to stick by.

23
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:58,555
You guys should have
cleared this with me first.

24
00:02:59,056 --> 00:03:01,475
- Is this the victim?
- No, it's Amelia Earhart.

25
00:03:01,558 --> 00:03:03,310
We found her, Detective,
and you missed it.

26
00:03:03,393 --> 00:03:07,189
I don't care what her name is.
I didn't give the order to move her.

27
00:03:07,272 --> 00:03:09,900
Jesus, Albrecht. I can see
why they took away your gold shield.

28
00:03:09,983 --> 00:03:12,069
I wasn't a big enough asshole.
Come on. Let's go.

29
00:03:14,571 --> 00:03:15,864
All right, clear outta here.

30
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:19,493
- Shelly?
- Stand back, kid.

31
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:24,956
- Where's Eric?
- Just don't worry about him.

32
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:29,294
Tell him to take care of Sarah.

33
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:32,589
Look, I will.
You just lie back. Come on.

34
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:45,268
- You Sarah?
- Yeah.

35
00:03:45,352 --> 00:03:49,314
Look, your sister-she's gonna be okay.

36
00:03:49,398 --> 00:03:53,735
She's not my sister.
Shelly just takes care of me.

37
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,237
She's my friend.

38
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,322
Her and Eric.

39
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:01,493
You lied to her about Eric.

40
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:03,161
I had to.

41
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:05,997
And you're lying to me about Shelly.

42
00:04:07,499 --> 00:04:09,418
She's gonna die, isn't she?

43
00:04:18,427 --> 00:04:20,554
Now, come on. Come on.

44
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:22,931
Come on. Lt's okay.

45
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:27,811
She's gonna be fine.

46
00:04:46,663 --> 00:04:50,584
<i>A building gets torched.
All that is left is ashes.</i>

47
00:04:51,293 --> 00:04:53,503
<i>I used to think that was true
about everything-</i>

48
00:04:53,587 --> 00:04:57,507
<i>families, friends, feelings.</i>

49
00:04:58,258 --> 00:05:02,012
<i>But now I know that sometimes,
if love proves real...</i>

50
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:06,516
<i>two people who are meant to be together-
nothing can keep them apart.</i>

51
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:35,378
Later.

52
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:46,723
What are you, like, the night watchman?

53
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:14,793
You know, what this place needs
is a good natural catastrophe.

54
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:18,255
Earthquake, tornado, you know.

55
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:19,589
No, no, no, no. Mickey.

56
00:06:19,673 --> 00:06:22,634
Come on, man. You got to put
the mustard underneath first.

57
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:25,011
Maybe a flood like in the Bible.

58
00:06:25,095 --> 00:06:27,055
Hey, let me do it.

59
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:32,269
There we go. All right.
How about some onions?

60
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,605
Don't cheap out on me.
Lots of onions.

61
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:36,773
Here you go.

62
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:39,234
There you go. All right.

63
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:40,819
Now we're talkin'.

64
00:06:42,028 --> 00:06:45,031
Hey, it's the Sarah monster.

65
00:06:46,575 --> 00:06:48,243
How do you steer that on a wet street?

66
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:50,412
Pure talent. Hi.

67
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:54,416
Sarah, she's a genuine “hot dogger.”
You hungry?

68
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:56,293
- You buyin'?
- I'm buyin'.

69
00:06:56,376 --> 00:06:58,545
No onions though, okay?

70
00:06:58,628 --> 00:07:00,088
No onions?

71
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:01,756
They make you fart big time.

72
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:12,350
You know, Lake Erie
actually caught on fire once...

73
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:15,145
from all the crap
floating around in it.

74
00:07:16,313 --> 00:07:18,064
I wish I could have seen that.

75
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:21,753
Fire it up!

76
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,380
Fire it up!

77
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:07,882
- We busted their machines!
- Boom!

78
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:34,242
Oh, shit, guys.
T-bird, cop car. Cop car.

79
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,085
Bad people out on the street tonight.

80
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:52,719
- Damn it!
- What was that?

81
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:54,202
- You wait right here.
- Be careful.

82
00:09:54,804 --> 00:09:56,556
Mickey, call it in for me!

83
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:21,349
Gabriel.

84
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:33,862
Eric?

85
00:11:33,945 --> 00:11:35,113
Department of Housing!

86
00:11:35,196 --> 00:11:37,282
Code violations?

87
00:11:37,365 --> 00:11:39,742
Safety hazards?

88
00:11:39,826 --> 00:11:41,995
Place looks fine to me.

89
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:44,038
Let's redecorate.

90
00:11:48,585 --> 00:11:54,299
“Abashed, the devil stood
and felt how awful goodness is...

91
00:11:54,382 --> 00:11:57,802
saw virtue in her shape how lovely.”

92
00:11:57,886 --> 00:11:58,970
lt's pornography.

93
00:12:00,138 --> 00:12:01,806
<i>Virtue?</i>

94
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:06,311
Shelly?

95
00:12:09,022 --> 00:12:10,315
See ya!

96
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,277
No, me first.

97
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:18,239
Please.

98
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:22,577
- Shelly.
- Eric.

99
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:04,035
That's good.

100
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:12,001
See if you can top that, man.
Can you top that?

101
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:15,046
Look at that. Look at that.

102
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:20,927
Here's to Devil's Night,
my new favorite holiday.

103
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,512
To Devil's Night.

104
00:13:24,514 --> 00:13:26,516
You go over there and tell your pals-

105
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:29,686
You sick fuck.

106
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:33,481
You're out of your
motherfuckin' mind, man.

107
00:13:39,696 --> 00:13:41,072
Look at that!

108
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:44,367
Pussies drink last, man.

109
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:48,204
Fuck you, Tin Tin.

110
00:13:50,415 --> 00:13:52,917
Shit ain't even loaded, man.

111
00:13:53,001 --> 00:13:54,085
This one is.

112
00:13:55,211 --> 00:14:01,050
Which of you Motor City motherfuckers
wants to bet me this one isn't?

113
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:06,556
Hey! Fire it up! Fire it up!

114
00:14:14,147 --> 00:14:15,940
Here's your shooters.

115
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:17,775
Put your guns away, huh, guys?

116
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:19,569
How ya doin', pussycat?

117
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:42,884
Boo.

118
00:14:53,186 --> 00:14:55,354
I love you.

119
00:14:55,438 --> 00:14:56,689
Say that again.

120
00:14:56,773 --> 00:14:57,940
I love you.

121
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:00,610
Oh, boy.

122
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:03,780
Restaurant.

123
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:11,829
<i>Wow, you look great.</i>

124
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:18,461
Yeah.

125
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:23,257
- Come here!
- No, no, no!

126
00:17:01,272 --> 00:17:03,900
Couple more rings. That's 24k.

127
00:17:03,983 --> 00:17:05,985
24k, huh? Lt's 18k.

128
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:07,987
It's crap. Lt's probably fake.

129
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,406
Leather purse. Leather.

130
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:13,784
Geez.

131
00:17:13,868 --> 00:17:16,662
What is this, Tin Tin-
a bloodstain that's on here?

132
00:17:19,749 --> 00:17:22,335
L'll give you 50 bucks.
And I hate charities.

133
00:17:22,418 --> 00:17:25,254
Now, you take it or leave it.

134
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,090
Right there for ya.

135
00:17:29,634 --> 00:17:32,178
Decisions, decisions. Yes, right.

136
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:37,266
You cheap-ass, chrome-dome...

137
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:41,312
child-molestin', saprophyte motherfucker.

138
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:42,772
Close the gate when you go out!

139
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:45,483
I closes up for you real good, massa.

140
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,276
Fuck you.

141
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:51,614
Yeah, sit on it and twirl, you dirty scum.

142
00:17:56,327 --> 00:17:58,913
Lucky I don't stab your fat ass.

143
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:48,230
What the fuck
you all painted up for, crackhead, huh?

144
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:55,571
Halloween ain't till mafiana.

145
00:19:59,158 --> 00:20:00,242
Come on.

146
00:20:26,227 --> 00:20:28,813
L'll kill you! You better go!

147
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:40,574
Fuck you, murderer!

148
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:44,120
I ain't murdered nobody, man!
I don't even fucking know you!

149
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:45,663
What the fuck you want, man?

150
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:48,207
I want you to tell me a story.

151
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,501
A man and a woman
in aloft a year ago.

152
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:54,255
- You're out ofyour fucking mind.
- Listen!

153
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:56,549
L'm sure you'll remember.

154
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:59,301
You killed them on Halloween.

155
00:20:59,385 --> 00:21:01,387
Yeah. Yeah, right.
Halloween, yeah.

156
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,056
Some dude, some bitch.
Whatever, man.

157
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,975
Her name was Shelly.

158
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:09,728
You cut her. You raped her.

159
00:21:09,812 --> 00:21:10,855
Shelly, yeah.

160
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:14,817
I shanked her pink ass,
and she loved it!

161
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,996
Murderer? Murderer?

162
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:29,790
Let me tell you about murder.
It's fun!

163
00:21:29,874 --> 00:21:31,667
It's easy.

164
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,503
You gonna learn all about it.

165
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:41,802
I'd like you to meet two buddies of mine.

166
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,514
We never miss.

167
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:56,775
Try harder. Try again!

168
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:06,660
Victims. Aren't we all?

169
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:23,928
<i>Sometimes it rains inside my head</i>

170
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:28,474
<i>When the words run dry</i>

171
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:31,769
<i>The walls are breathing</i>

172
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:34,813
Look at this mess!
What's the world comin' to?

173
00:22:34,897 --> 00:22:36,190
Yeah, it's a mess.

174
00:22:41,362 --> 00:22:43,447
<i>No, they don't have to take you</i>

175
00:22:43,531 --> 00:22:46,325
I gotta go upstairs.
Report from the front.

176
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:50,955
<i>No, they don't have to take you away</i>

177
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,375
Get out of my way, you worms!

178
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:57,419
Give me some of that over there!

179
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:03,175
Why don't you ladies come by later?
Check me out.

180
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:05,010
Hey, guess what.

181
00:23:05,094 --> 00:23:08,180
Arcade Games fell down, went boom.

182
00:23:08,264 --> 00:23:09,390
Boom.

183
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:12,101
Can you imagine that? Lt's tragic.

184
00:23:12,977 --> 00:23:17,147
Gather your soldiers.
You're on for tomorrow night. No sweat.

185
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:20,484
- Is the man in?
- He's taking a meeting.

186
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:51,974
You're thinking about the past.

187
00:23:57,229 --> 00:23:59,106
Dad gave me this.

188
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:01,191
Fifth birthday.

189
00:24:03,611 --> 00:24:07,281
He said. “Childhood's over
the moment you know you're gonna die.”

190
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:23,505
ls she asleep?

191
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:32,598
I think we broke her.

192
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,607
I love her eyes. Pretty.

193
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:50,532
<i>No, they don't have to take you away</i>

194
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,876
Hey, kid, get the hell outta the road!

195
00:25:19,061 --> 00:25:20,396
Don't fuck with me.

196
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:26,110
I told you to stay out of here.

197
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:29,697
Sol guess you're not gonna be home
till a lot later, huh, Darla?

198
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,699
She's busy.

199
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:33,784
Go play with your dolls
or something, okay?

200
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:35,244
I don't have any dolls.

201
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:39,623
Get some food, huh?

202
00:25:39,707 --> 00:25:42,751
Somebody already bought me dinner.
The police.

203
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,343
“Somebody already bought me dinner.
The police.”

204
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:05,357
Thirty, forty dollars.

205
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:09,528
Who the fuck is this now?

206
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:13,782
Hey! Piss off! We're closed!

207
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:20,456
Go sleep it off somewhere else, dust-head,
unless you want to get mutilated.

208
00:26:25,294 --> 00:26:27,546
L'm gonna blow this guy's dick off.

209
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:31,508
Goddamn creatures of the night.
They never learn.

210
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:35,512
Hey! Hey!

211
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:45,856
“Suddenly I heard a tapping,
as if someone gently rapping...

212
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:48,317
rapping at my chamber door.”

213
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,654
What are you talking about?

214
00:26:52,738 --> 00:26:55,365
You heard me rapping, right?

215
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:59,620
You're trespassing,
and you owe me a fuckin' new door!

216
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:05,000
L'm looking for something
in an engagement ring.

217
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:06,251
Gold.

218
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:08,837
You're looking for a coroner,
shit-for-brains.

219
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:16,929
Oh, shit. Oh, shit on me!

220
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:20,849
Shit on me. Shit on me!

221
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,234
Mr. Gideon. You're not paying attention.

222
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:36,698
No! My hand!

223
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:42,204
I repeat. A gold engagement ring, yes?

224
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:47,167
It was pawned here a year ago
by a customer of yours named Tin Tin.

225
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:53,423
He confided in me
before he ran out of breath.

226
00:27:58,804 --> 00:28:00,639
Who's this sack of shit?

227
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:03,851
That's Tin Tin,
one of T-bird's little helpers.

228
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:06,979
I think you can rule out accidental death.

229
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:09,857
Don't any ofyour street demons
have real grown-up names?

230
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:14,111
This could be a turf hit, but it doesn't
look like your usual gang crap.

231
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:18,907
Come on, Albrecht, spare me.
You're a beat cop now, so be a beat cop.

232
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:20,909
L'm supposed to thank you for that, right?

233
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:24,746
Word to the wise. Watch your fuckin' mouth.

234
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:28,375
What the hell do you call that?

235
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:32,004
I call it blood, Detective.

236
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:35,841
I suppose you'll write it up as graffiti.

237
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:38,719
You can leave
my crime scene now, okay?

238
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,353
- Warmer?
- What are you doing?

239
00:28:48,437 --> 00:28:51,106
- Don't you know this game?
- What game are you talkin' about?

240
00:28:52,024 --> 00:28:54,026
Okay, I'll tell you about the rings!

241
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:57,112
They're in that metal box!
It's under the shelf there!

242
00:28:59,197 --> 00:29:01,116
Take 'em! Take your fucking rings!

243
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:04,167
And you can choke on them,
you son of a bitch!

244
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:10,292
- Look, it goes up to the attic.
- Okay.

245
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:22,137
No. No. No.

246
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:31,355
It's beautiful. I don't believe it.

247
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:36,652
<i>Shelly.</i>

248
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:47,162
I love you.

249
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:58,173
- You have one chance to live.
- Take anything you want.

250
00:29:58,256 --> 00:29:59,675
- Thankyou.
- Take anything!

251
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:06,974
Now you're gonna tell me where to find
the rest of Tin Tin's little party pals.

252
00:30:07,057 --> 00:30:08,684
The Pit. They all hang out at the Pit.

253
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:11,228
All of T-bird's little potato-heads
hang out there.

254
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:14,606
Funboy-he lives there upstairs, all right?

255
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:15,732
Funboy.

256
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:17,693
Oh, baby.

257
00:30:19,528 --> 00:30:22,114
- A whole jolly club-
- Stop! Please!

258
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:24,366
With jolly pirate nicknames!

259
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:27,077
- Jesus Christ in a taxicab!
- Hold still!

260
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:34,751
Each one of these is a life-
a life you helped destroy.

261
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:37,421
L'm begging you. Don't kill me.

262
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:41,341
L'm not gonna kill you.

263
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:45,429
Yourjob will be to tell the rest of them
that death is coming for them-

264
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:47,222
tonight.

265
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:56,898
Tell them Eric Draven sends his regards.

266
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:04,364
You walk outta here,
they're gonna erase your sorry ass.

267
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,175
You're nothing but street grease!
You hear that?

268
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:08,577
Street grease, you motherfucker!

269
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,203
Is that gasoline I smell?

270
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:11,788
No, man, no!

271
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:35,270
It's on the house, kiddo.
You know that.

272
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:38,273
One root beer.

273
00:31:40,442 --> 00:31:42,986
I can't do anything.

274
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:47,532
Your mom, technically, she's off right now.

275
00:31:47,616 --> 00:31:49,659
Yeah, way off.

276
00:31:54,372 --> 00:31:56,416
Police! Don't move!

277
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,627
I said, “Don't move!”

278
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:02,339
I thought the police always said “Freeze!”

279
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:04,758
lam the police
and I say don't move, Snow White.

280
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:06,343
You move, you're dead.

281
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:11,640
And I say I'm dead and I move.

282
00:32:12,516 --> 00:32:14,976
Not one more step. I'm serious.

283
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:19,397
Then shoot, if you will, Officer Albrecht.

284
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:22,609
What are you, nuts?
Walking into a gun?

285
00:32:22,692 --> 00:32:24,402
YOU high?

286
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:27,697
- You don't remember me?
- What are you talking about?

287
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:31,743
How about Shelly?
Do you remember Shelly Webster?

288
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:34,538
Shelly Webster's dead, my friend.

289
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:38,083
I want you to move over to the curb.
Real nice and easy.

290
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:39,167
Move it!

291
00:32:42,254 --> 00:32:43,922
We're gonna wait here for backup.

292
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:46,007
It's gettin' too friggin' weird for me.

293
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:48,593
Oh, it gets better.

294
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:51,179
D0 you know someone named T-bird?

295
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:54,474
He had a friend who shouldn't have
played with knives.

296
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:55,767
Like the coat?

297
00:32:55,851 --> 00:32:59,104
- You're the guy that murdered Tin Tin.
- Hey, check it out!

298
00:33:00,564 --> 00:33:02,023
He was already dead.

299
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:05,694
He died a year ago-
the moment he touched her.

300
00:33:08,196 --> 00:33:11,199
They're all dead.
Theyjust don't know it yet.

301
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:13,702
Get away from there!

302
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:16,454
Cops! Get outta here!

303
00:33:18,206 --> 00:33:20,208
Leave it! Leave it! Run!

304
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:28,842
Oh, great. Great.

305
00:33:30,135 --> 00:33:32,846
Guy shows up looking like
a mime from hell...

306
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:35,307
and you lose him
right out in the open.

307
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:40,270
Well, at least he didn't do that
“walking against the wind” shit.

308
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:42,647
- I hate that.
- Little early for Devil's Night.

309
00:33:43,732 --> 00:33:45,066
What the hell is going on there?

310
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:49,487
You are very restless.

311
00:33:49,571 --> 00:33:52,657
Just wish I was a little hungry again.
That's all.

312
00:33:52,741 --> 00:33:54,409
Be careful of what you ask for.

313
00:33:54,492 --> 00:33:56,369
Yeah, you may get it. I know.

314
00:34:08,381 --> 00:34:11,468
There are energies aligning against you.

315
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:14,012
Seeing is believing, isn't it?

316
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:27,817
Yummy.

317
00:34:33,198 --> 00:34:37,077
Gideon's pawnshopjust burned down
to the foundation.

318
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,621
Nobody cleared this little event with me.

319
00:34:39,704 --> 00:34:42,290
I didn't have nothing to do with that.

320
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:45,001
- L'm sure you must be awful disappointed.
- I got trouble.

321
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:48,421
One of my crew got himself perished.

322
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:50,799
- Who might that be?
- Tin Tin.

323
00:34:50,882 --> 00:34:55,428
Somebody stuck his blades in all
his major organs in alphabetical order.

324
00:34:55,512 --> 00:34:58,848
Gentlemen, I think we ought to have
an introspective moment of silence...

325
00:34:58,932 --> 00:35:01,351
for poor old Tin Tin.

326
00:35:04,312 --> 00:35:06,564
You're working for me
tomorrow night, right?

327
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:09,442
- Whatever you say. I can do.
- Good.

328
00:35:09,526 --> 00:35:11,611
That's very reassuring.

329
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:15,282
I still ain't heard the story
on why Gideon's burned down.

330
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:20,996
Is that a natural catastrophe
or act of God or something?

331
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,707
Call it my need to know.

332
00:35:55,655 --> 00:35:57,824
Hey! Let me go!, you creep!

333
00:36:04,247 --> 00:36:07,542
You didn't even slow down,
you dickhead!

334
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:12,339
- He couldn't have stopped.
- He was a butt-face.

335
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:14,049
I could have made it.

336
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:18,053
What are you supposed to be,
a clown or something?

337
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:20,930
Sometimes.

338
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:25,185
It's more like surfing than skating.

339
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:27,729
I wish the rain would stop, just once.

340
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:30,357
It can't rain all the time.

341
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,400
Eric?

342
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:53,963
Don't thank me.
Are we fighting the good fight?

343
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:56,508
Double homicide a year ago.

344
00:36:56,591 --> 00:36:58,426
No convictions.

345
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:01,930
Annie, look at that.

346
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:07,268
“We, the undersigned tenants
of 1929 Caulderon Court Apartments”-

347
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:08,853
What is this, a petition?

348
00:37:08,937 --> 00:37:11,332
A big “kick me” sign for a very nice girl
who found herself a cause.

349
00:37:11,356 --> 00:37:12,857
The cause got her killed.

350
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:15,443
She was fighting tenant eviction
in that neighborhood?

351
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:21,408
Shelly Webster and her nice
rock-and-roll boyfriend, Eric Draven.

352
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:25,036
The last time you snooping on a case
is when you got put back on the beat.

353
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,124
- I know. Torres keeps reminding me.
- I bet he does.

354
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:39,843
You're gonna wind up
working a school crosswalk.

355
00:37:39,926 --> 00:37:42,053
L'm cool.

356
00:37:42,137 --> 00:37:46,266
You didn't get that file from me, okay?
And don't tell me you owe me one.

357
00:37:47,934 --> 00:37:49,436
I owe you one.

358
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:51,521
Yeah, right.

359
00:37:51,604 --> 00:37:53,815
Damn.

360
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:22,927
Tomorrow night we can get high...

361
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:26,639
and watch this whole fucking city
burn from that window.

362
00:38:52,165 --> 00:38:54,375
There's a big fuckin' bird over there.

363
00:38:58,713 --> 00:38:59,714
It's a squab.

364
00:39:01,716 --> 00:39:05,303
Come here, bird.
Hey, bird. Hey, bird.

365
00:39:05,386 --> 00:39:07,722
Bird. Birdie.

366
00:39:07,805 --> 00:39:10,391
Here, birdie, birdie.

367
00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:13,436
Come here, birdie, birdie, birdie.

368
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,986
Here, Funboy.

369
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,241
What the fuck?

370
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:37,085
Man, don't do that!
You nearly gave me a fucking heart attack!

371
00:39:37,168 --> 00:39:39,420
Look at the guy.

372
00:39:39,504 --> 00:39:41,089
Don't sweat it.

373
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:47,095
It's time for you to take
your bird and leave, freako.

374
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:59,816
Take your shot, Funboy.
You got me dead bang.

375
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:06,781
You are seriously fucked up.
Did you look in the mirror?

376
00:40:06,864 --> 00:40:10,410
You need professional help.

377
00:40:13,204 --> 00:40:14,664
Bingo!

378
00:40:14,747 --> 00:40:17,458
He shoots! He scores!

379
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:30,263
Jesus Christ!

380
00:40:30,346 --> 00:40:34,100
Jesus Christ?
Stop me if you heard this one.

381
00:40:34,183 --> 00:40:36,436
Jesus Christ walks into a hotel.

382
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:45,320
He hands the innkeeper
three nails, and he asks-

383
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:48,906
Don't you ever fuckin' die?

384
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,825
“Can you put me up for the night?”

385
00:40:56,748 --> 00:41:01,336
- Does that hurt?
- Fuck, yes, it fuckin' hurts!

386
00:41:02,337 --> 00:41:03,504
Oh, God.

387
00:41:04,255 --> 00:41:07,634
Look what you've done to my sheets.

388
00:41:31,866 --> 00:41:33,868
I've got a gun in my pocket.

389
00:41:36,704 --> 00:41:39,582
You're happy to see me, aren't you?

390
00:41:57,392 --> 00:42:01,229
Stay away! Stay away from me!

391
00:42:09,112 --> 00:42:10,697
Look.

392
00:42:12,907 --> 00:42:17,453
“Mother” is the name for God
on the lips and hearts of all children.

393
00:42:17,537 --> 00:42:22,291
D0 you understand?
Morphine is bad for you.

394
00:42:33,928 --> 00:42:37,515
Your daughter is out there
on the streets waiting for you.

395
00:43:09,547 --> 00:43:13,301
If I wanted ice, I would have
asked for ice! Now fill it up!

396
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,764
Fill it up yourself, macho man.

397
00:43:17,847 --> 00:43:19,515
I really need this.

398
00:43:27,732 --> 00:43:29,025
All right.

399
00:43:31,027 --> 00:43:33,029
You burn yourself playing with matches?

400
00:43:33,112 --> 00:43:35,698
- Fuck off.
- You have an appointment.

401
00:43:35,782 --> 00:43:38,242
- Well, shit on me.
- Drink up.

402
00:43:38,326 --> 00:43:41,245
This is a first.
Do I bow or do I curtsy?

403
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:44,165
Get my friend here a glass of blood.

404
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:49,170
- Hey, hon!
- Good night, Darla.

405
00:43:53,049 --> 00:43:56,719
You stay put right there.

406
00:44:06,103 --> 00:44:08,314
Get away, steam-head.

407
00:44:40,805 --> 00:44:44,350
<i>You can see I'm here on the corner
of 27th Street and East Washington Place...</i>

408
00:44:44,433 --> 00:44:47,728
<i>the site of last year's
biggest Devil's Night conflagration.</i>

409
00:44:47,812 --> 00:44:50,012
<i>It was exactly one year ago
that the building you see...</i>

410
00:44:50,064 --> 00:44:53,693
<i>across the street from me
was totally demolished by fire.</i>

411
00:44:53,776 --> 00:44:56,404
<i>The fire that was fought
by seven fire companies...</i>

412
00:44:56,487 --> 00:44:58,531
<i>and cost the lives of two firefighters.</i>

413
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:03,494
<i>In fact, if it weren't for the constant
surveillance by the local police precinct-</i>

414
00:45:03,578 --> 00:45:06,122
Freeze!

415
00:45:06,205 --> 00:45:08,624
Jesus. Don't ever do that, man.

416
00:45:10,459 --> 00:45:11,919
Fuck.

417
00:45:14,839 --> 00:45:16,090
Good likeness.

418
00:45:16,173 --> 00:45:19,886
I saw your body, man.
You died. You got buried.

419
00:45:21,053 --> 00:45:22,221
You still have your hat on.

420
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,227
I gotta sit down.

421
00:45:31,022 --> 00:45:32,815
Holy shit.

422
00:45:35,318 --> 00:45:36,736
<i>Say...</i>

423
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:42,325
are you some kind of... ghost?

424
00:45:42,408 --> 00:45:43,408
Boo.

425
00:45:51,959 --> 00:45:53,878
I don't know what I am.

426
00:45:53,961 --> 00:45:56,505
I need you to tell me what happened to us.

427
00:45:58,591 --> 00:46:02,595
You took a six-story swan dive
out of a window.

428
00:46:02,678 --> 00:46:05,765
She was beaten and raped.

429
00:46:05,848 --> 00:46:10,436
Died at the hospital.
Hey, you asked, man.

430
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:12,939
Come on. Read the file.

431
00:46:13,022 --> 00:46:17,568
Shelly Webster held on for 30 hours
in intensive care.

432
00:46:17,652 --> 00:46:20,696
Her body finallyjust gave it up.

433
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:23,658
I saw it. I couldn't dojack for her.

434
00:46:35,211 --> 00:46:36,629
- Hey.
- Don't touch me!

435
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:44,887
You okay?

436
00:46:44,971 --> 00:46:46,889
I saw her.

437
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:52,520
I saw her through your eyes.

438
00:46:52,603 --> 00:46:54,772
You stayed with her the whole time.

439
00:46:54,855 --> 00:46:59,026
Well, you gotta understand
something, all right?

440
00:47:00,361 --> 00:47:05,116
I was hoping she'd come out of it,
you know...

441
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:08,119
give me something I could work with.

442
00:47:08,202 --> 00:47:09,787
Yeah.

443
00:47:11,664 --> 00:47:12,915
Look, I-

444
00:47:12,999 --> 00:47:15,501
Why didn't you do something about it?

445
00:47:15,584 --> 00:47:18,939
You think any of those people in that building-
even the ones who signed the petition-

446
00:47:18,963 --> 00:47:20,715
would talk after what happened to you?

447
00:47:22,508 --> 00:47:24,677
I kept asking questions...

448
00:47:25,886 --> 00:47:28,526
and finally got busted for sticking
my nose where it wasn't wanted.

449
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,437
This your wife?

450
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:39,066
Yeah, we-Well, not anymore.
We're getting a divorce.

451
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,069
It's funny.

452
00:47:43,863 --> 00:47:47,575
Little things used to mean
so much to Shelly.

453
00:47:47,658 --> 00:47:49,994
I used to think
they were kind of trivial.

454
00:47:50,077 --> 00:47:53,372
Believe me, nothing is trivial.

455
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:08,637
You shouldn't smoke these.
They'll kill you.

456
00:48:13,726 --> 00:48:16,562
Are you gonna vanish
into thin air again?

457
00:48:20,608 --> 00:48:22,902
I thought I'd use your front door.

458
00:48:25,905 --> 00:48:27,406
Look, man...

459
00:48:28,991 --> 00:48:31,786
I'm sorry as hell for what happened
to you and your girlfriend.

460
00:48:33,287 --> 00:48:34,663
Yeah.

461
00:48:41,295 --> 00:48:42,671
Yeah.

462
00:48:43,798 --> 00:48:46,717
I got stabbed!
I shot the son of a bitch!

463
00:48:46,801 --> 00:48:49,553
I watched the bullet hole
close by itself.

464
00:48:49,637 --> 00:48:52,723
And then my business
gets blown up real good.

465
00:48:52,807 --> 00:48:55,810
- Other than that, my day sucked.
- Yeah.

466
00:48:55,893 --> 00:48:58,604
I saw him too. He had a guitar.

467
00:48:58,687 --> 00:49:03,109
He winked at me before hejumped out
a fourth-floor window like he had wings.

468
00:49:03,192 --> 00:49:06,862
He winked at ya? Musicians.

469
00:49:08,322 --> 00:49:09,824
What else did you see?

470
00:49:09,907 --> 00:49:12,867
So far I haven't heard shit about what
you're gonna do about all this crap!

471
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:17,706
What do I get? My livelihood
got flushed away and went swirling.

472
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,752
You ain't lost everything.

473
00:49:21,836 --> 00:49:26,966
Yeah? And maybe you're not
such a big shot eithefljesus!

474
00:49:27,842 --> 00:49:30,636
Fair enough. Catch.

475
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:34,140
Jesus.

476
00:49:34,223 --> 00:49:36,642
Say hello to the last fellow
who wouldn't cooperate with me.

477
00:49:36,725 --> 00:49:38,561
Are you tellin' me this thing is real?

478
00:49:38,644 --> 00:49:42,314
All the power in the world
resides in the eyes, fella.

479
00:49:42,398 --> 00:49:46,485
Sometimes they're more useful
than the people who bear them.

480
00:49:46,569 --> 00:49:50,698
You're directly out ofyour fucking mind!
You know that?

481
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,619
Yeah. Eyes see.

482
00:49:55,703 --> 00:49:58,664
It's one of the most important things
I learned from my sister.

483
00:49:58,747 --> 00:50:00,387
Sister? She's supposed to be your sister?

484
00:50:02,084 --> 00:50:05,421
My father's daughter. That's right.

485
00:50:05,504 --> 00:50:07,424
What's the matter,
you don't see the resemblance?

486
00:50:09,008 --> 00:50:11,010
Now, let's take it from the top, friend.

487
00:50:11,093 --> 00:50:14,513
With a lot of detail. What do you say?

488
00:50:14,597 --> 00:50:18,142
He had a bird with him.
Nearly pecked my face off.

489
00:50:18,225 --> 00:50:21,645
He told me to tell T-bird
that death was on its way.

490
00:50:21,729 --> 00:50:23,939
Whatever the fuck that means.

491
00:50:24,857 --> 00:50:27,776
Draven. He said his name was Eric Draven.

492
00:50:28,861 --> 00:50:30,946
You wanna relax that thing now?

493
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:35,701
This bird man, hejust happened
to let you live, huh?

494
00:50:35,784 --> 00:50:39,997
You sure you ain't making all this up
just to save your own ass?

495
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,875
I ain't makin' all this up.

496
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:46,128
I ain't twisted like you two fucks.

497
00:50:49,298 --> 00:50:51,425
All right.

498
00:50:55,971 --> 00:50:57,598
A boy and his bird.

499
00:50:59,141 --> 00:51:01,101
Awful touching.

500
00:51:11,362 --> 00:51:14,323
For fuck's sake, die, will ya?
Give me that thing.

501
00:51:21,288 --> 00:51:22,289
Thanks.

502
00:51:23,666 --> 00:51:25,960
Funboy said he saw a black bird too.

503
00:51:26,043 --> 00:51:28,420
A big one.

504
00:51:28,504 --> 00:51:30,839
Then he choked to death
on his own blood.

505
00:51:32,508 --> 00:51:35,261
<i>L'll</i> have thejanitor come on up.

506
00:52:39,825 --> 00:52:44,038
You again. Are you lost or hungry?

507
00:52:44,121 --> 00:52:45,748
Hi.

508
00:52:49,251 --> 00:52:51,170
<i>It can't rain all the time</i>

509
00:52:51,253 --> 00:52:53,255
<i>Can't rain all the time</i>

510
00:53:04,892 --> 00:53:07,662
I mean, how many times I gotta tell you?
We're in this together, or we ain't!

511
00:53:07,686 --> 00:53:09,688
If one part falls, it all falls!

512
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,109
You know how long it took us
to put this together.

513
00:53:14,193 --> 00:53:16,838
Then that piece of rat shit made Tin Tin
into a fuckin' voodoo doll!

514
00:53:16,862 --> 00:53:18,572
Tin Tin was a dick.

515
00:53:19,365 --> 00:53:20,866
Tin Tin.

516
00:53:22,076 --> 00:53:26,288
Fire it up! Fire it up!
Fire it up! Fire it up!

517
00:53:26,372 --> 00:53:28,248
Fire it up!

518
00:53:32,086 --> 00:53:33,837
No Funboy.

519
00:53:33,921 --> 00:53:36,924
Probably still bangin' away on Darla.

520
00:53:42,304 --> 00:53:45,391
Smokes and road beers. Be quick.

521
00:53:45,474 --> 00:53:47,476
L'm on it.

522
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:21,760
What the fuck
are you supposed to be, man?

523
00:54:23,554 --> 00:54:25,681
L'm your passenger.

524
00:54:33,772 --> 00:54:35,482
Drive.

525
00:54:40,571 --> 00:54:42,364
What's all this happy horseshit?

526
00:54:43,365 --> 00:54:45,576
Hey, T-bird! T-bird!

527
00:54:49,997 --> 00:54:53,250
- Oh, shit!
- What the fuck's the matter with you?

528
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:57,337
Stupid ass-hair! You hit my car!

529
00:55:04,303 --> 00:55:08,724
What do you want, man?
Money? Drugs? I got it.

530
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:13,228
We could use you.
You did Tin Tin.

531
00:55:13,312 --> 00:55:16,398
- This is business, right?
- Faster.

532
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,195
You got that cream stuff?

533
00:55:23,614 --> 00:55:26,033
I hate this.
They can't even call it cream legally.

534
00:55:27,618 --> 00:55:29,578
What in the crap-

535
00:55:34,082 --> 00:55:36,793
Oh, look. Mal<in' us popular.

536
00:55:36,877 --> 00:55:39,713
When they flash us like that,
they ain't friends.

537
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:48,180
<i>This is vehicle 48.
We got us a big old red hot rod.</i>

538
00:55:50,766 --> 00:55:52,935
Turn.

539
00:55:54,269 --> 00:55:57,022
You got something personal, amigo,
we can work it out.

540
00:55:57,105 --> 00:55:58,273
Right?

541
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:05,531
Damn! Dead end!

542
00:56:10,911 --> 00:56:12,371
Look out!

543
00:56:16,667 --> 00:56:18,293
Dumb ass! Get outta the way!

544
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:34,268
Holy shit! Goddamn foreign cars!

545
00:56:39,106 --> 00:56:40,440
Shit! Shit!

546
00:56:49,116 --> 00:56:51,243
I hate this. This ain't good.

547
00:56:52,661 --> 00:56:56,164
T-bird! I got you, man!

548
00:56:56,248 --> 00:56:57,457
Shit!

549
00:57:12,389 --> 00:57:13,783
Remember? Yeah.
I remember everything.

550
00:57:13,807 --> 00:57:16,143
But I don't know-What? What?

551
00:57:17,394 --> 00:57:19,396
What? What are you talkin' about?

552
00:57:19,479 --> 00:57:20,731
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

553
00:57:20,814 --> 00:57:23,734
You mean that place downtown?
Yeah, I remember her.

554
00:57:23,817 --> 00:57:25,819
We needed to put some fear
into that little lady.

555
00:57:25,902 --> 00:57:29,197
She wasn't going along
with our tenant relocation program.

556
00:57:29,281 --> 00:57:32,743
Then her idiot boyfriend shows up
and turns a simple sweep-and-clear...

557
00:57:32,826 --> 00:57:35,203
into a total cluster fuck!

558
00:57:35,287 --> 00:57:38,123
Who gives a shit?
It's ancient history!

559
00:57:38,206 --> 00:57:41,543
What? What do you want?
What is it? What?

560
00:57:41,627 --> 00:57:44,671
Speak to me! Speak!

561
00:57:46,256 --> 00:57:48,175
Did you send us these complaints?

562
00:57:49,843 --> 00:57:53,138
Come here!
“Abashed, the devil stood”-

563
00:57:53,221 --> 00:57:55,641
Does it get you sweaty?

564
00:57:56,350 --> 00:58:01,063
I know you. I know you.
I knew I knew you.

565
00:58:01,146 --> 00:58:04,983
I knew I knew you.
But you ain't you.

566
00:58:05,067 --> 00:58:07,611
You can't be you.
We put you through the window.

567
00:58:07,694 --> 00:58:09,488
There ain't no coming back.

568
00:58:09,571 --> 00:58:12,741
This is the really real world.
There ain't no coming back.

569
00:58:12,824 --> 00:58:15,077
We killed you dead.
There ain't no coming back.

570
00:58:19,706 --> 00:58:22,709
There ain't no coming back!
There ain't no coming back!

571
00:58:29,508 --> 00:58:32,803
“Abashed, the devil stood...

572
00:58:32,886 --> 00:58:35,764
and felt how awful goodness is.”

573
00:58:35,847 --> 00:58:38,850
“And felt how awful goodness is.”

574
00:58:41,311 --> 00:58:42,311
“And felt”-

575
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:55,450
T-bird!

You're holding out on me.

605

I got a goddamn vigilante killer
knocking off scumbags left and right...

606

and you're covering up for somebody.

Who's the cartoon character
in the painted face?

608

You're the detective.
Why don't you tell me?

609

Okay. Gideon's blows to hell, and you're

one of my case files from Homicide...

Suspension? For what?

620
01:02:29,247 --> 01:02:31,625
Misconduct.

Man, Sarah, you're going crazy.

627
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:22,527
Gabriel.

628
01:04:24,279 --> 01:04:27,115
I thought you were dead.

You're not dead, are you?

630

I knew it was you.

631
01:05:00,065 --> 01:05:02,067
Even with the makeup.

632
01:05:07,781 --> 01:05:10,158
I remembered your song.

633
01:05:10,241 --> 01:05:13,870
You said,
“Can't rain all the time.”

634
01:05:13,953 --> 01:05:16,081
That is from your song, right?

635
01:05:27,759 --> 01:05:30,261
Come on, Eric.
I know you're here.

636
01:05:33,139 --> 01:05:35,934
I miss you and Shelly.

637
01:05:40,313 --> 01:05:43,191
Gets so lonely all by myself.

638
01:05:46,778 --> 01:05:49,697
The hell with you.
I thought you cared.

639
01:05:50,824 --> 01:05:53,493
Sarah, I do care.

640
01:06:04,045 --> 01:06:06,256
That's him. That's him!

641
01:06:06,339 --> 01:06:09,717
But he looked different. He was painted
up white like some kind of dead whore.

642
01:06:09,801 --> 01:06:13,054
I seen him. T-bird sent me in
for some road beers, right?

643
01:06:13,138 --> 01:06:15,640
Then he took him away.
But I chased him down.

644
01:06:15,723 --> 01:06:18,560
And he flash-fried T-bird
to his fuckin' car!

645
01:06:19,352 --> 01:06:22,105
T-bird! Here's to you, buddy.

646
01:06:22,188 --> 01:06:26,192
Maybe we oughta just videotape this,
play it back in slow motion.

647
01:06:27,735 --> 01:06:32,073
- Fire it up! Fire it up!
- You see the grave?

648
01:06:32,157 --> 01:06:33,408
Empty-

649
01:06:34,826 --> 01:06:36,703
Grave? What grave?

650
01:06:36,786 --> 01:06:40,415
- What about my fuckin' grave?
- Three out of four.

651
01:06:40,498 --> 01:06:43,751
He's working his way back
to this speed freak right here.

652
01:06:43,835 --> 01:06:46,462
It's not fair. Lt's Funboy's fault.

653
01:06:46,546 --> 01:06:49,757
That boy was out of control.
T-bird, he came in, he said...

654
01:06:49,841 --> 01:06:53,094
“Waste them both.” And now this ghost
gonna kill my ass next!

655
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:00,351
This ghost gonna kill my ass next.

656
01:07:01,352 --> 01:07:03,563
- This ghost gonna kill-
- Hey!

657
01:07:04,147 --> 01:07:06,107
It ain't no ghost.

658
01:07:08,026 --> 01:07:09,777
They have all arrived.

659
01:07:09,861 --> 01:07:13,239
Watch him. We might need him.

660
01:07:14,908 --> 01:07:17,202
Ghost gonna kill my-

661
01:07:30,298 --> 01:07:32,300
He like his plain or with onions?

662
01:07:34,636 --> 01:07:37,805
Fine. Don't talk to me.

663
01:07:37,889 --> 01:07:40,975
When someone's dead,
they can't come back, can they?

664
01:07:42,435 --> 01:07:44,687
That's what I thought.

665
01:07:44,771 --> 01:07:47,023
Are you referring
to anyone in particular?

666
01:07:47,106 --> 01:07:49,651
You'll just think I'm nuts.

667
01:07:49,734 --> 01:07:51,894
Yeah, well, then maybe
they'll have to lock us both up.

668
01:07:53,613 --> 01:07:55,907
You see him too?

669
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:58,493
I saw somebody.

670
01:07:59,327 --> 01:08:01,329
Maybe it was your fairy godfather.

671
01:08:03,081 --> 01:08:05,500
Eric didn't come back for me.

672
01:08:05,583 --> 01:08:09,921
He can't be my friend anymore
because I'm alive.

673
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:12,799
You want a friend to walk you home?

674
01:09:01,764 --> 01:09:06,060
<i>You things, things
things of the flesh</i>

675
01:09:06,144 --> 01:09:08,813
<i>Do it slow</i>

676
01:09:08,896 --> 01:09:13,192
<i>Down avenues, cut me</i>

677
01:09:13,276 --> 01:09:16,946
<i>Lust in my eyes</i>

678
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:19,991
<i>Licking lips encouraging</i>

679
01:09:20,074 --> 01:09:23,911
<i>Mr. Careworn</i>

680
01:09:23,995 --> 01:09:29,459
<i>To gaze upon the screen, mask on</i>

681
01:09:29,542 --> 01:09:31,669
<i>After the flesh</i>

682
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:48,853
<i>Boys.</i>

683
01:09:51,022 --> 01:09:53,816
It seems our friend T-bird
won't be joining us this evening...

684
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:56,944
on account of a slight case of death.

685
01:09:57,028 --> 01:09:59,030
You wanna sit down?

686
01:10:02,241 --> 01:10:06,454
Well, well, well.
Devil's Night is upon us again.

687
01:10:06,537 --> 01:10:08,498
I thought we'd throw a little party...

688
01:10:08,581 --> 01:10:11,876
start a bunch of fires,
make a little profit.

689
01:10:11,959 --> 01:10:14,128
I like the pretty lights.

690
01:10:17,131 --> 01:10:21,010
Problem is, it's all been done before.
You see what I'm saying?

691
01:10:21,094 --> 01:10:22,720
That's no reason to quit.

692
01:10:22,804 --> 01:10:26,307
Wrong. Best reason to quit.

693
01:10:26,391 --> 01:10:28,768
Only reason to quit.

694
01:10:30,103 --> 01:10:32,939
A man has an idea.

695
01:10:34,732 --> 01:10:38,194
The idea attracts others...
like-minded.

696
01:10:39,445 --> 01:10:44,784
The idea expands.
The idea becomes an institution.

697
01:10:46,077 --> 01:10:47,495
What was the idea?

698
01:10:49,705 --> 01:10:51,332
That's what's been bothering me, boys.

699
01:10:51,416 --> 01:10:54,210
But I'll tell ya, when I used
to think about the idea itself...

700
01:10:54,293 --> 01:10:56,796
it'd put a big old smile on my face.

701
01:10:58,339 --> 01:11:00,383
You see, gentlemen...

702
01:11:00,466 --> 01:11:03,594
greed is for amateurs.

703
01:11:05,179 --> 01:11:10,226
Disorder, chaos, anarchy-

704
01:11:10,309 --> 01:11:12,019
now that's fun!

705
01:11:12,103 --> 01:11:15,022
- What about Devil's Night?
- What about it?

706
01:11:15,106 --> 01:11:18,526
I started the first fires
in this goddamn city.

707
01:11:18,609 --> 01:11:21,654
Before I knew it, every charlatan
and shit-heel was imitating me.

708
01:11:21,737 --> 01:11:25,158
Do you know what they got now?

709
01:11:25,241 --> 01:11:28,327
Devil's Night greeting cards.

710
01:11:29,996 --> 01:11:32,582
Isn't that precious?

711
01:11:32,665 --> 01:11:34,292
Yeah.

712
01:11:35,001 --> 01:11:39,714
The idea has become
the institution, boys.

713
01:11:39,797 --> 01:11:41,591
Time to move along.

714
01:11:41,674 --> 01:11:44,153
You don't want us to do “Light My
Fire” time for the whole city?

715
01:11:44,177 --> 01:11:46,637
No.

716
01:11:46,721 --> 01:11:51,058
I want you to set a fire so goddamn big,
the gods will notice us again.

717
01:11:51,142 --> 01:11:53,769
That's what I'm saying.
I want all you boys...

718
01:11:53,853 --> 01:11:57,231
to be able to look me straight
in the eye one more time and say...

719
01:11:57,315 --> 01:11:59,942
“Are we having fun or what?”

720
01:12:00,026 --> 01:12:03,863
Hey, you! What's your name?
Skank, you don't feel that?

721
01:12:03,946 --> 01:12:05,865
I feel like a little worm
on a big fuckin' hook.

722
01:12:07,325 --> 01:12:09,827
“L feel like a little worm
on a big fuckin' hook.”

723
01:12:09,911 --> 01:12:14,207
Well, boy, your mama
must be damn proud ofyou!

724
01:12:16,667 --> 01:12:19,337
How the hell did
that thing get in here?

725
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:22,048
Gentlemen.

726
01:12:24,050 --> 01:12:27,929
There he is! Let me go!
Let me go! I gotta go!

727
01:12:33,184 --> 01:12:36,270
You're him, huh? The avenger.

728
01:12:36,354 --> 01:12:38,814
The killer of killers.

729
01:12:38,898 --> 01:12:41,776
Nice outfit.

730
01:12:41,859 --> 01:12:43,903
L'm not sure about the face though.

731
01:12:44,904 --> 01:12:47,281
Ijust want him.

732
01:12:47,365 --> 01:12:49,492
Well, you can't have him.

733
01:12:49,575 --> 01:12:51,202
<i>Well...</i>

734
01:12:54,914 --> 01:12:56,791
I see you have made your decision.

735
01:12:58,417 --> 01:13:00,336
Now let's see you enforce it.

736
01:13:00,419 --> 01:13:04,090
This is already
boring the shit out of me. Kill him!

737
01:13:11,639 --> 01:13:13,933
That had to hurt.

738
01:13:15,601 --> 01:13:16,769
Well, that's that.

739
01:13:17,979 --> 01:13:20,064
That guy was crazy.

740
01:13:26,654 --> 01:13:28,447
He's gone.

741
01:13:36,497 --> 01:13:37,665
Get him!

742
01:13:57,184 --> 01:13:59,395
Help me! He's gonna kill me!

743
01:14:03,316 --> 01:14:04,317
Jesus Christ!

744
01:14:56,077 --> 01:14:57,536
You're all going to die.

745
01:15:12,551 --> 01:15:14,261
Get the fuck outta here!

746
01:15:51,173 --> 01:15:54,093
Guess it's not a good day
to be a bad guy, huh, Skank?

747
01:15:54,176 --> 01:15:58,472
L'm not Skank.
There's Skank right there.

748
01:15:58,556 --> 01:16:01,308
- Skanl<'s dead.
- That's right.

749
01:16:10,067 --> 01:16:11,569
What in the crap-

750
01:16:12,862 --> 01:16:15,489
- Freeze!
- Hold it!

751
01:16:15,573 --> 01:16:18,993
That's all she wrote!
Move and we shoot!

752
01:16:27,501 --> 01:16:30,963
You are surrounded by police units.
Do not attempt to escape.

753
01:16:34,425 --> 01:16:36,343
Stop running immediately.

754
01:16:36,427 --> 01:16:37,970
Holy shit!

755
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:50,649
Repeat. Stop immediately.
Lie down, spread your arms and legs.

756
01:17:33,859 --> 01:17:35,861
Come on! Move it!

757
01:17:40,866 --> 01:17:43,410
My advice? Next time, duck.

758
01:17:45,454 --> 01:17:47,832
So many cops, you'd think
they were giving away doughnuts.

759
01:17:51,293 --> 01:17:52,878
Shit!

760
01:17:58,342 --> 01:18:00,177
I knew you were gonna do that.

761
01:18:01,428 --> 01:18:05,724
Look at that out there.
The whole city oughta be in flames by now.

762
01:18:06,892 --> 01:18:08,978
Sky oughta be red.

763
01:18:09,061 --> 01:18:13,399
So that, I take it,
is the late, great Eric Draven.

764
01:18:13,482 --> 01:18:19,154
He has power, but it is power
you can take from him.

765
01:18:19,238 --> 01:18:21,115
I like him already.

766
01:18:21,198 --> 01:18:24,159
The crow is his link...

767
01:18:24,243 --> 01:18:26,787
between the land of the living...

768
01:18:26,871 --> 01:18:29,164
and the realm of the dead.

769
01:18:29,248 --> 01:18:33,794
So, kill the crow
and destroy the man.

770
01:18:59,987 --> 01:19:01,989
L'm coming home, Shelly.

771
01:19:50,037 --> 01:19:54,583
You're gonna say I shouldn't be in the
cemetery in the middle of the night, right?

772
01:19:54,667 --> 01:19:57,211
Safest place in the world to be.

773
01:19:57,294 --> 01:20:01,298
It's 'cause everybody's dead.
I knew you'd come here.

774
01:20:03,008 --> 01:20:05,511
It's really late, Sarah.

775
01:20:05,594 --> 01:20:08,305
You didn't say good-bye.

776
01:20:08,389 --> 01:20:11,016
You'rejust gonna have
to forgive me for that.

777
01:20:12,518 --> 01:20:14,520
And you're never coming back.

778
01:20:23,362 --> 01:20:26,365
I gave this to Shelly once.

779
01:20:30,035 --> 01:20:33,038
I think she'd like you to have it.

780
01:20:37,042 --> 01:20:39,336
This way, you'll always remember her.

781
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:42,006
L'll never take it off.

782
01:21:01,316 --> 01:21:03,944
I better go sneak back in the house.

783
01:21:10,617 --> 01:21:12,077
Bye.

784
01:21:37,644 --> 01:21:39,146
Take it easy, sweetheart.

785
01:21:46,403 --> 01:21:48,614
Come on. Come on.

786
01:22:02,628 --> 01:22:05,964
What is that? Some sort of
souvenir there from your pal?

787
01:22:07,591 --> 01:22:10,677
L'll just keep it for good luck.
What do you say?

788
01:22:17,351 --> 01:22:20,479
Her eyes are so innocent.

789
01:22:32,449 --> 01:22:33,700
Eric!

790
01:22:33,784 --> 01:22:35,285
Eric, help!

791
01:23:18,370 --> 01:23:20,622
Quick impression for ya.

792
01:23:20,706 --> 01:23:24,168
Caw! Caw! Bang!
Fuck, I'm dead!

793
01:23:24,251 --> 01:23:27,588
Give me the girl
and I'll let you walk out of here.

794
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:33,594
Well, well. Why don't you just give me
a minute to think about that, huh?

795
01:23:43,228 --> 01:23:44,855
Nah, fuck it.

796
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:55,407
Aw, fuck.

797
01:24:02,414 --> 01:24:04,374
Well, well, well.

798
01:24:04,458 --> 01:24:07,169
It does seem to me that
our little life has undergone...

799
01:24:07,252 --> 01:24:09,713
a rather significant change
in the past few minutes now.

800
01:24:09,796 --> 01:24:11,131
Wouldn't you agree?

801
01:24:15,427 --> 01:24:18,889
Well, for a ghost, you bleed just fine.

802
01:24:22,392 --> 01:24:24,645
- It's still alive.
- Well, then kill it!

803
01:24:26,939 --> 01:24:28,232
Bye-bye, birdie.

804
01:24:50,337 --> 01:24:51,797
It's mine.

805
01:25:14,403 --> 01:25:15,737
Shit.

806
01:25:15,821 --> 01:25:19,950
Well, just came by to pay my respects,
and here you are getting all shot up again.

807
01:25:20,033 --> 01:25:22,619
- They've taken Sarah.
- How many?

808
01:25:22,703 --> 01:25:24,246
Two more.

809
01:25:25,330 --> 01:25:26,748
I can handle it. Don't worry.

810
01:25:26,832 --> 01:25:29,710
L'm not worried.
Look, here's the plan.

811
01:25:29,793 --> 01:25:32,313
You stay in front, and when they
run out of ammo, I'll arrest 'em.

812
01:25:32,337 --> 01:25:36,008
That sounds like a great plan.
There'sjust one problem.

813
01:25:38,677 --> 01:25:42,180
Oh, shit.
You're bleeding all over the place.

814
01:25:42,264 --> 01:25:44,308
I thought, you know,
you were invincible.

815
01:25:44,391 --> 01:25:47,853
I was. I'm not anymore.

816
01:25:49,313 --> 01:25:52,149
Well, I guess you really will
need my help, won't you?

817
01:25:52,232 --> 01:25:53,233
Come on.

818
01:25:58,238 --> 01:25:59,865
You take that.

819
01:26:29,936 --> 01:26:31,521
You were supposed to stay behind me.

820
01:26:31,605 --> 01:26:33,398
I think I messed up.

821
01:26:57,506 --> 01:27:01,051
This is all the power you ever had.

822
01:27:01,134 --> 01:27:02,928
Now it is mine.

823
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:07,808
Pity there's not more time...

824
01:27:07,891 --> 01:27:09,434
for us.

825
01:27:27,577 --> 01:27:30,414
Help, Eric! I'm scared!

826
01:27:33,166 --> 01:27:34,793
Let me go!

827
01:27:44,803 --> 01:27:46,346
Let her go!

828
01:27:49,266 --> 01:27:52,352
You can have me.
I won't fight you.

829
01:27:53,937 --> 01:27:55,856
- All right.
- No!

830
01:29:03,715 --> 01:29:05,342
Sarah?

831
01:29:05,425 --> 01:29:06,425
Look out!

832
01:29:12,265 --> 01:29:13,433
Eric!

833
01:29:21,775 --> 01:29:26,154
You know, my daddy used to say,
“Every man's got a devil...

834
01:29:26,238 --> 01:29:28,406
and you can't rest
till you find him.”

835
01:29:28,490 --> 01:29:31,034
What happened back there
with you and your girlfriend-

836
01:29:32,035 --> 01:29:34,371
I cleared that building.

837
01:29:34,454 --> 01:29:37,958
Hell, nothing in this town happens
without my say-so.

838
01:29:38,041 --> 01:29:40,293
So I'm sorry if I spoiled
your wedding plans, friend.

839
01:29:41,419 --> 01:29:44,339
But if it's any consolation to you...

840
01:29:44,422 --> 01:29:46,883
you have put a smile on my face.

841
01:29:46,967 --> 01:29:49,594
You got a lot of spirit, son.

842
01:29:50,595 --> 01:29:52,889
Lam gonna miss you.

843
01:29:52,973 --> 01:29:54,849
I have something to give you.

844
01:29:54,933 --> 01:29:57,394
I don't want it anymore.

845
01:30:01,815 --> 01:30:03,775
Thirty hours of pain!

846
01:30:07,195 --> 01:30:08,905
All at once!

847
01:30:11,783 --> 01:30:13,785
All for you.

848
01:30:48,945 --> 01:30:50,530
Go help him.

849
01:30:54,826 --> 01:30:57,037
Are you alive?

850
01:31:00,999 --> 01:31:03,043
God, I need a cigarette.

851
01:31:09,007 --> 01:31:11,051
Everybody else dead?

852
01:31:11,134 --> 01:31:13,595
You helped me.

853
01:31:13,678 --> 01:31:15,930
What you kept in here saved me.

854
01:31:16,014 --> 01:31:19,142
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

855
01:31:19,225 --> 01:31:21,227
I've been meaning
to come to church anyway.

856
01:31:27,233 --> 01:31:28,860
Oh, yuck.

857
01:31:31,071 --> 01:31:35,075
L'm quitting as of now-if I live.

858
01:31:44,751 --> 01:31:46,961
Stay with him until help comes.

859
01:31:47,045 --> 01:31:50,548
He'll be okay, right?

860
01:31:51,508 --> 01:31:52,842
Eric?

861
01:31:55,887 --> 01:31:57,889
He does that a lot.

862
01:32:14,489 --> 01:32:15,990
Shelly.

863
01:32:28,795 --> 01:32:33,633
- All right, what's going on in there?
- Multiple homicide.

864
01:32:34,884 --> 01:32:37,846
- At least it stopped raining, huh?
- Lt can't rain all the time.

865
01:32:37,929 --> 01:32:41,307
I don't believe it.
This nightmare your fault, Albrecht?

866
01:32:41,391 --> 01:32:45,061
Look, you go on home.
I'm okay.

867
01:32:45,145 --> 01:32:48,606
- Want to tell me what's going on?
- Your vigilante's up on the roof.

868
01:32:50,817 --> 01:32:52,068
You missed it.

869
01:32:52,902 --> 01:32:54,821
Get him outta here!

870
01:33:59,511 --> 01:34:01,137
Thanks.

871
01:34:06,810 --> 01:34:09,813
