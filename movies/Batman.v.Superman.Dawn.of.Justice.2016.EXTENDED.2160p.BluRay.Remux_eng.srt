1
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:21,234
There was a time above.

2
00:00:21,401 --> 00:00:23,756
A time before.

3
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:26,714
There were perfect things,

4
00:00:26,921 --> 00:00:29,151
diamond absolutes.

5
00:00:30,161 --> 00:00:32,436
How things fall.

6
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:35,035
Things on Earth.

7
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,793
And what falls...

8
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:38,601
Master Wayne!

9
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:40,154
- ...is fallen.
- Bruce!

10
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:43,474
Bruce, it's all right.

11
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:47,280
Bruce, please.

12
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:12,712
Martha.

13
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:48,600
In the dream,
they took me to the light.

14
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:50,592
A beautiful lie.

15
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,110
- Jack.
- Bruce.

16
00:05:37,281 --> 00:05:38,714
Jack, listen to me.

17
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:41,121
I want you to get everyone
out of the building right now.

18
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:43,080
- You understand?
- Oh, my God.

19
00:05:43,281 --> 00:05:44,457
Stay away from the windows!

20
00:05:44,481 --> 00:05:46,601
Let's go. Come on.
Start moving now, people. Let's go.

21
00:05:46,761 --> 00:05:49,400
The boss wants us out of the building,
so let's make it happen.

22
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:51,478
Jack. Jack!

23
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:34,017
We're sorry.

24
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:38,353
All circuits are busy now.
Will you please try your call again later?

25
00:07:39,841 --> 00:07:41,354
Heavenly God,

26
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:44,119
creator of Heaven and Earth,

27
00:07:45,481 --> 00:07:46,630
have mercy on my soul.

28
00:07:50,561 --> 00:07:51,630
Jack!

29
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:32,919
Buddy hands! Everybody show me! Good job!

30
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:35,189
Come on, guys.

31
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:38,320
Hold on tight.

32
00:08:39,921 --> 00:08:40,921
Come on, guys.

33
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:43,521
Go.

34
00:08:43,761 --> 00:08:44,830
Mr. Wayne!

35
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,953
Mr. Wayne! I can't feel my legs.

36
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:49,697
I can't feel my legs.

37
00:08:49,721 --> 00:08:51,561
We need help over here!

38
00:08:52,121 --> 00:08:53,440
Help me. I can't feel my legs.

39
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:55,193
You're gonna be okay. You hear me?

40
00:08:56,121 --> 00:08:58,316
Wallace?
What do they call you, Wally? Huh?

41
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:01,596
You're the boss, boss.

42
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:05,431
All right. You're gonna be okay.

43
00:09:05,601 --> 00:09:06,954
Easy, easy. Come on.

44
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:11,720
Oh, my God.
I can't move my leg.

45
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:14,671
My God. I can't feel my legs.

46
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:24,992
It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

47
00:09:25,161 --> 00:09:28,312
You're okay. All right? Huh?

48
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:30,121
You know what? We're gonna find your mom.

49
00:09:30,561 --> 00:09:31,630
Where is she?

50
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:37,591
All that wind is bad luck.
Blood in the sky.

51
00:11:38,361 --> 00:11:39,476
Oh, there she is!

52
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:49,116
Miss Lane.

53
00:11:50,921 --> 00:11:52,639
Miss Lane. Jimmy Olsen.

54
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:54,632
Photographer. Obviously.

55
00:11:55,001 --> 00:11:56,354
Where's Heron?

56
00:11:56,641 --> 00:11:57,915
Uh, trouble at the border.

57
00:12:00,441 --> 00:12:03,319
So, uh, how'd you land it?
This is, like, pioneer stuff.

58
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:05,711
Amajagh's never given an interview.

59
00:12:05,881 --> 00:12:08,839
You know what Heron always
says when we're on assignment together?

60
00:12:10,201 --> 00:12:11,634
Not a goddamn thing.

61
00:12:12,561 --> 00:12:13,710
I like Heron.

62
00:12:27,441 --> 00:12:28,669
Let's go.

63
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,391
Passports.
Electronics. Phones. Camera.

64
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:39,870
Your fixer said that
the general approved photos.

65
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:10,956
Are you a terrorist, General?

66
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,192
They did not tell me the interview
was with a lady.

67
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,794
I'm not a lady. I'm a journalist.

68
00:13:19,561 --> 00:13:22,314
What I am is a man with nothing

69
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:25,078
except a love of my people.

70
00:13:26,401 --> 00:13:28,790
Who's paying for these
security contractors, General?

71
00:13:29,401 --> 00:13:31,682
Who pays for the drones
that pass over our heads at night?

72
00:13:33,561 --> 00:13:35,217
One question begs another.

73
00:13:35,241 --> 00:13:36,390
Yes?

74
00:13:36,961 --> 00:13:38,599
Say what you're saying, General.

75
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:40,160
It's just a camera.

76
00:13:40,721 --> 00:13:42,632
The United States
has declared its neutrality

77
00:13:42,841 --> 00:13:43,921
in your country's civil war

78
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:46,151
both in policy and in principle.

79
00:13:46,921 --> 00:13:49,481
Don't open... You just exposed...

80
00:13:51,881 --> 00:13:54,076
These pious American fictions...

81
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:55,833
...spoken like truth.

82
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,001
Okay. That's my film.

83
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:06,995
Men with power obey
neither policy nor principle, Miss Lane.

84
00:14:10,401 --> 00:14:11,436
No one is different.

85
00:14:12,441 --> 00:14:14,557
No one is neutral.

86
00:14:24,401 --> 00:14:25,401
CIA.

87
00:14:26,601 --> 00:14:27,875
They're tracking us!

88
00:14:28,521 --> 00:14:29,681
You!

89
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:35,790
You're CIA?

90
00:14:35,961 --> 00:14:37,189
What? No. No!

91
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:39,477
- You brought him here!
- No, he's a photographer.

92
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:42,561
No!

93
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:49,200
It's okay, Lois.

94
00:15:07,081 --> 00:15:08,081
Talon's down, sir.

95
00:15:08,761 --> 00:15:10,521
Python, we have lost our
asset on the ground.

96
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:12,791
Repeat, we have lost our
asset on the ground.

97
00:15:13,001 --> 00:15:15,834
There's still a civilian in
the compound. We'll extract her.

98
00:15:16,001 --> 00:15:18,799
Negative. RPA to engage.
Stand down and get black.

99
00:15:19,361 --> 00:15:22,114
There'll be friendlies
in the blast zone, so...

100
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,720
Call off the goddamn drone.

101
00:15:24,361 --> 00:15:27,000
Stand down is an order. Python?

102
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:28,596
Let's move!

103
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:37,916
I...

104
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,521
I didn't know.

105
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:44,877
Ignorance is not the same as innocence,

106
00:15:45,521 --> 00:15:46,715
Miss Lane.

107
00:16:13,921 --> 00:16:16,515
Get up! Stand up!

108
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,593
Quickly. He's coming.

109
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:45,080
Inbound 2 mikes.

110
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:47,997
Passing Python now.

111
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,430
Move out!

112
00:17:04,841 --> 00:17:06,911
- Target locked.
- You are clear to engage.

113
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:08,875
Armed hot and in range.

114
00:17:14,281 --> 00:17:15,839
Three.

115
00:17:17,961 --> 00:17:19,997
Two. One.

116
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:31,914
Link's been hit.

117
00:17:32,121 --> 00:17:33,554
By what?

118
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:41,198
Take one step,
you will see the inside of her head.

119
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:07,914
The women
in the village heard a noise.

120
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:12,670
Like the sky cracked open.

121
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:17,796
He came down. Then came fire.

122
00:19:19,801 --> 00:19:21,712
Even worse came after.

123
00:19:22,881 --> 00:19:24,360
The government attacked.

124
00:19:25,121 --> 00:19:27,157
No mercy in the villages.

125
00:19:28,521 --> 00:19:30,273
My parents tried to run.

126
00:19:34,961 --> 00:19:38,112
The world has been so caught up
with what Superman can do

127
00:19:38,321 --> 00:19:41,074
that no one has asked what he should do.

128
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:46,993
Let the record show that this
committee holds him responsible.

129
00:19:47,201 --> 00:19:49,112
He'll never answer to you.

130
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:53,752
He answers to no one.
Not even, I think, to God.

131
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:58,150
58 to nothing.

132
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:00,471
Metropolis, again,
blowing out Gotham City.

133
00:20:00,641 --> 00:20:02,697
Really, only the diehards
are left in the stands.

134
00:20:02,721 --> 00:20:05,457
Delta Charlie 27.
Reports of screams coming from vacant home

135
00:20:05,481 --> 00:20:07,199
at 1939 Harborway.

136
00:20:07,401 --> 00:20:08,857
Tom, it's been great
working with you.

137
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:10,521
I want to thank our
producer and director.

138
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:12,137
- Now wait a second.
- I don't even want to suggest...

139
00:20:12,161 --> 00:20:13,617
Delta Charlie 27, respond.

140
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:14,641
Just take a knee.

141
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:17,577
They're lining up as if
Clarkson is gonna throw it deep here.

142
00:20:17,601 --> 00:20:18,937
- Don't tell me, Dave.
- Going to the end zone!

143
00:20:18,961 --> 00:20:20,657
- This is unnecessary.
- Delta Charlie 27.

144
00:20:20,681 --> 00:20:23,673
Zeke Baker is open.
Baker with a touchdown catch!

145
00:20:23,841 --> 00:20:25,217
I can't believe
I just watched that.

146
00:20:25,241 --> 00:20:27,391
Delta Charlie 27.
Do you copy?

147
00:20:28,401 --> 00:20:29,629
10-4. We're on it.

148
00:20:29,801 --> 00:20:31,678
And now a fight breaks out.

149
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:35,191
Gotham City, you know
how they are about their football team.

150
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:38,154
Things could get ugly
in the city tonight.

151
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,315
Go.

152
00:21:33,121 --> 00:21:34,156
It's okay.

153
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:35,876
It's okay.

154
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,921
We're gonna help.
We're here to help.

155
00:21:39,161 --> 00:21:41,470
We're gonna get you out of here. Okay?

156
00:21:51,681 --> 00:21:53,114
I don't understand.

157
00:21:57,841 --> 00:21:59,559
Please don't.
Please don't.

158
00:22:08,121 --> 00:22:11,397
Please. I don't know who he is.

159
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:16,000
I don't know who he is!

160
00:22:19,201 --> 00:22:20,998
No!

161
00:22:41,681 --> 00:22:42,909
Oh, fuck.

162
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:23,001
Christ!

163
00:23:23,161 --> 00:23:24,514
I saw him.

164
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:26,558
I never saw him before.
I... I didn't know.

165
00:23:26,721 --> 00:23:28,154
You almost took my face off.

166
00:23:28,321 --> 00:23:30,357
How about you don't shoot
the good guys, huh?

167
00:23:31,921 --> 00:23:33,798
Oh. Oh.

168
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:35,912
Jesus Christ.

169
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,719
He branded him.

170
00:25:07,921 --> 00:25:09,877
- Hey.
- Hey.

171
00:25:10,081 --> 00:25:11,434
I was gonna cook.

172
00:25:11,961 --> 00:25:13,155
Surprise you.

173
00:25:17,721 --> 00:25:19,598
They held hearings about what happened.

174
00:25:21,761 --> 00:25:23,257
- They're saying that...
- I don't care.

175
00:25:23,281 --> 00:25:25,272
I don't care what they're saying.

176
00:25:27,281 --> 00:25:29,241
The woman I love could have
been blown up or shot.

177
00:25:29,841 --> 00:25:31,017
Think of what could have happened.

178
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:33,350
Well, think about what did happen.

179
00:25:33,521 --> 00:25:35,796
I didn't kill those men,
if that's what they think.

180
00:25:35,961 --> 00:25:37,097
If that's what you're saying.

181
00:25:37,121 --> 00:25:39,794
No, I'm saying
I want to understand what happened.

182
00:25:41,721 --> 00:25:43,712
I'm saying thank you for saving my life.

183
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:45,633
I'm saying there's a cost.

184
00:25:54,521 --> 00:25:56,477
I just don't know if it's possible.

185
00:25:57,721 --> 00:25:59,200
Don't know if what's possible?

186
00:26:02,641 --> 00:26:04,154
For you to love me and be you.

187
00:26:32,641 --> 00:26:34,074
Clark!

188
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:37,271
Clark, you're going
to flood the apartment.

189
00:26:37,481 --> 00:26:39,392
Mmm-hmm.

190
00:27:12,401 --> 00:27:13,401
You still working?

191
00:27:14,561 --> 00:27:16,950
You're getting slow
in your old age, Alfred.

192
00:27:17,121 --> 00:27:19,077
Comes to us all, Master Wayne.

193
00:27:20,361 --> 00:27:22,477
Even you got too old to die young.

194
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:26,791
And not for lack of trying.

195
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:31,337
Funnel-ferry butterbar.
Funnel-ferry butterbar.

196
00:27:31,361 --> 00:27:32,777
Funnel-ferry butterbar. Funnel-ferry...

197
00:27:32,801 --> 00:27:34,441
There's nothing wrong
with the microphone.

198
00:27:35,641 --> 00:27:37,552
It's this new layer of armor.

199
00:27:38,761 --> 00:27:40,160
I'll just have to rewire.

200
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:45,511
So, last night was productive?

201
00:27:46,961 --> 00:27:49,998
No. He's too low-level. He knew nothing.

202
00:27:50,361 --> 00:27:52,272
This is the man who knows things.

203
00:27:53,401 --> 00:27:56,473
Anatoli Knyazev. He's Russian.

204
00:27:57,121 --> 00:27:58,440
Contracts all over the globe,

205
00:27:58,601 --> 00:28:00,097
but he's based out of the port of Gotham.

206
00:28:00,121 --> 00:28:01,634
Weapons and human trafficking.

207
00:28:01,801 --> 00:28:03,561
So the White Portuguese
is a Russian.

208
00:28:03,601 --> 00:28:04,920
That's the theory.

209
00:28:05,121 --> 00:28:10,115
No. The theory is that the Russian
will lead me to the man himself.

210
00:28:10,441 --> 00:28:13,274
If he is, indeed, a "him."

211
00:28:14,521 --> 00:28:17,399
You don't even know if he exists.
Could be a phantasm.

212
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:19,631
One that wants to bring
a dirty bomb into Gotham?

213
00:28:20,801 --> 00:28:22,473
Ah, high-stakes round.

214
00:28:25,561 --> 00:28:27,279
New rules.

215
00:28:30,441 --> 00:28:32,113
We're criminals, Alfred.

216
00:28:32,281 --> 00:28:34,397
We've always been criminals.
Nothing's changed.

217
00:28:35,521 --> 00:28:36,749
Oh, yes, it has, sir.

218
00:28:39,321 --> 00:28:40,834
Everything's changed.

219
00:28:45,721 --> 00:28:47,393
Men fall from the sky.

220
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:50,831
The gods hurl thunderbolts.

221
00:28:52,281 --> 00:28:54,033
Innocents die.

222
00:28:55,441 --> 00:28:57,113
That's how it starts, sir.

223
00:28:58,001 --> 00:29:00,151
The fever. The rage.

224
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:03,154
The feeling of powerlessness.

225
00:29:04,841 --> 00:29:08,754
It turns good men cruel.

226
00:29:20,441 --> 00:29:21,635
John, get D.

227
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:25,797
Ooh. Ah. Ahoy, ahoy!
I did not know you were here.

228
00:29:25,961 --> 00:29:27,838
- Man on the marquee.
- Yeah, don't believe it.

229
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:29,377
My father named the company
after himself.

230
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:31,401
He was the Lex in front of the Corp.
How you doin'?

231
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:32,635
Really great.

232
00:29:32,801 --> 00:29:35,520
Really great? Good. Good.
Uh, follow me.

233
00:29:35,681 --> 00:29:38,434
No, uh, Dad started saying
that he named the company,

234
00:29:38,641 --> 00:29:40,154
after his kid at investor pitches.

235
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:42,561
Rich old ladies.
They thought it was very cute, you know?

236
00:29:42,601 --> 00:29:44,319
"Write checks for Lex."

237
00:29:45,601 --> 00:29:47,592
You know, Dad was born in East Germany.

238
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:49,917
He grew up eating stale crackers.

239
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:52,161
And every other Saturday,
he had to march in a parade

240
00:29:52,321 --> 00:29:54,198
and wave flowers at tyrants.

241
00:29:54,361 --> 00:29:58,070
So, I think it was providence
that his son, me,

242
00:29:58,241 --> 00:29:59,390
would end up with this.

243
00:29:59,601 --> 00:30:02,069
One of my Rebuild Metropolis
crews found it.

244
00:30:02,241 --> 00:30:04,675
Little souvenir from
the Kryptonian World Engine.

245
00:30:04,841 --> 00:30:06,841
What does a rock have to do
with homeland security?

246
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:08,553
Homeland security? Hmm.

247
00:30:08,721 --> 00:30:11,394
No, no, no, ma'am, planetary security.

248
00:30:11,881 --> 00:30:14,270
The fragment
is of a radioactive xenomineral.

249
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:16,671
We suspected it might
have bio-interactions,

250
00:30:16,841 --> 00:30:18,752
so we took the sample to AMRIID,

251
00:30:20,241 --> 00:30:23,278
where they keep the remains
of the Kryptonian decedent.

252
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:26,918
And, when we exposed
General Zod to the mineral,

253
00:30:27,081 --> 00:30:28,309
this happened.

254
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:33,273
Profound biodegradation.
Decaying Kryptonian cells.

255
00:30:33,441 --> 00:30:35,017
We concluded the mineral
could be weaponized

256
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,441
if a large enough sample was found.

257
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,832
And then, among the fishes, a whale.

258
00:30:40,201 --> 00:30:41,201
Ah!

259
00:30:41,521 --> 00:30:43,557
Lying at the bottom of the Indian Ocean.

260
00:30:44,161 --> 00:30:45,480
Emerald City.

261
00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:48,353
Beautiful.

262
00:30:48,521 --> 00:30:49,749
Now, Rocky is radioactive,

263
00:30:49,921 --> 00:30:53,118
but what he needs from you
is an import license.

264
00:30:53,281 --> 00:30:55,636
And why would we want to
weaponize this material?

265
00:30:55,841 --> 00:30:56,841
As a deterrent.

266
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:59,457
A silver bullet to keep in reserve,
to use against the Kryptonians,

267
00:30:59,481 --> 00:31:00,834
so the day does not come, madam,

268
00:31:01,041 --> 00:31:03,361
when your children are waving
daisies at a reviewing stand.

269
00:31:03,441 --> 00:31:04,954
Last I looked, the only one of those

270
00:31:05,121 --> 00:31:06,759
flying around up here was Superman.

271
00:31:06,921 --> 00:31:09,958
Ha-ha, yes. Superman.
Yeah, but there are...

272
00:31:10,121 --> 00:31:11,121
There are more of them.

273
00:31:11,281 --> 00:31:12,475
The metahuman thesis.

274
00:31:12,681 --> 00:31:13,955
Yes, the metahuman thesis.

275
00:31:14,121 --> 00:31:15,395
More likely than not

276
00:31:15,601 --> 00:31:17,432
these exceptional beings live among us.

277
00:31:17,641 --> 00:31:19,791
The basis of our myths.
Gods among men upon

278
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,519
our little blue planet here.

279
00:31:24,201 --> 00:31:26,112
Now, you don't have to use
a silver bullet.

280
00:31:26,321 --> 00:31:28,391
But if you forge one...

281
00:31:28,601 --> 00:31:29,954
Well, then

282
00:31:30,201 --> 00:31:32,476
we don't have to depend
upon the kindness of monsters.

283
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:39,516
There are ways we can help each other.

284
00:31:40,881 --> 00:31:42,951
Would you step
into my office here?

285
00:31:46,921 --> 00:31:48,149
Yes.

286
00:31:48,681 --> 00:31:50,399
What's your wish list?

287
00:31:54,241 --> 00:31:56,994
Access to the wreck of
the crashed Kryptonian ship?

288
00:31:59,121 --> 00:32:00,190
Done.

289
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:52,234
The complete remains
of the dead alien for testing.

290
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:55,069
You want Zod's body?

291
00:32:56,321 --> 00:32:57,321
Okay.

292
00:33:11,921 --> 00:33:14,230
Mmm.

293
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:34,909
It's cherry.

294
00:33:37,921 --> 00:33:39,240
Mmm-mmm.

295
00:33:41,441 --> 00:33:42,874
Because the time has come

296
00:33:43,081 --> 00:33:46,198
for the world to hear
the other side of the story.

297
00:33:46,361 --> 00:33:49,592
They say that Superman is a hero.
Okay, but whose hero?

298
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,911
If Superman were here right now,

299
00:33:52,081 --> 00:33:53,480
what would you want to say to him?

300
00:33:54,121 --> 00:33:56,112
That my family, too, had dreams.

301
00:33:58,281 --> 00:34:02,638
To look him in his eye
and ask him how he decides

302
00:34:03,321 --> 00:34:04,754
which lives count.

303
00:34:05,521 --> 00:34:07,193
And which ones do not.

304
00:35:17,521 --> 00:35:18,874
Sir, get down.

305
00:35:20,481 --> 00:35:22,915
Sir, I said get down!

306
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:24,275
Now!

307
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,554
Can we get some backup here?

308
00:35:28,841 --> 00:35:30,832
Hey! Hey! Don't do it!

309
00:35:31,001 --> 00:35:32,116
Hey!

310
00:35:34,521 --> 00:35:36,751
Lois! Crime lab, on three.

311
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:40,234
- This is Lane.
- Kent.

312
00:35:40,401 --> 00:35:41,516
You're Sports today.

313
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,036
I want you to go to Gotham,
follow up on football.

314
00:35:44,241 --> 00:35:47,950
"Underdog Dreams Dashed:
Ten Yards Between Gotham and Glory."

315
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:51,196
Watch yourself over there in Gotham.

316
00:35:51,361 --> 00:35:52,841
Don't let them take your lunch money.

317
00:35:53,921 --> 00:35:55,718
Hey. Are you guys watching this?

318
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:57,361
Emergency responders quickly created

319
00:35:57,441 --> 00:36:00,035
a precautionary perimeter
around Heroes Park

320
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:02,521
while they brought the man down
from this beloved monument.

321
00:36:02,721 --> 00:36:05,838
The suspect has been identified
as Wallace Vernon Keefe.

322
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:08,720
I work for Bruce Wayne!

323
00:36:08,881 --> 00:36:11,554
He'll be arraigned
on charges of vandalism,

324
00:36:11,721 --> 00:36:12,756
resisting arrest,

325
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:15,151
and the felony charge of
making terrorist threats.

326
00:36:15,361 --> 00:36:16,953
That carries up to 40 years in prison.

327
00:36:17,121 --> 00:36:18,315
Poor son of a bitch.

328
00:36:18,561 --> 00:36:19,994
Metropolis News 8.

329
00:36:20,281 --> 00:36:21,281
- Jenny.
- Hmm.

330
00:36:21,441 --> 00:36:24,831
Headline, "End of Love Affair
with Man in the Sky,

331
00:36:25,001 --> 00:36:26,229
"question mark."

332
00:36:27,921 --> 00:36:29,115
Okay.

333
00:37:10,681 --> 00:37:11,681
Is she in?

334
00:37:12,561 --> 00:37:13,960
No, she's been gone.

335
00:37:14,481 --> 00:37:15,630
What'd she do, officer?

336
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:20,152
I'm not a cop. I'm a reporter.

337
00:37:22,001 --> 00:37:23,639
The young lady living here...

338
00:37:24,121 --> 00:37:25,474
She hasn't been back.

339
00:37:25,681 --> 00:37:27,921
In fact, if she's smart,
then she's got out of this city.

340
00:37:28,001 --> 00:37:30,834
And you need to
get out of here before dark.

341
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:32,137
Unless you want to run into him.

342
00:37:32,161 --> 00:37:34,152
Don't listen to that nonsense.

343
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:37,836
Only people scared of him,
people who got reason to be.

344
00:37:38,001 --> 00:37:39,150
Scared of who?

345
00:37:39,361 --> 00:37:42,034
There's a new kind of mean in him.

346
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:43,955
He is angry.

347
00:37:46,121 --> 00:37:47,600
And he's hunting.

348
00:37:51,281 --> 00:37:52,441
Show 'em what you got!

349
00:37:52,921 --> 00:37:54,639
Let's go. Come on!

350
00:37:58,041 --> 00:37:59,235
Throw a punch, will ya?

351
00:38:00,921 --> 00:38:03,151
Let's go! Come on!

352
00:38:26,321 --> 00:38:27,436
Thank you.

353
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:37,881
The house treats luck like an insult.

354
00:38:38,801 --> 00:38:41,554
Good luck for one is always
his brother's misfortune.

355
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:47,617
Three nights with a Bolshoi ballerina,

356
00:38:47,641 --> 00:38:48,960
that line was all she taught me.

357
00:38:49,481 --> 00:38:52,473
Not all, I'm sure. Good evening.

358
00:38:58,081 --> 00:38:59,912
It's like a one-man
reign of terror.

359
00:39:00,081 --> 00:39:03,630
This Bat vigilante has been
consistently targeting the port

360
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:05,598
and the adjacent projects and tenements.

361
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:07,817
And, as far as I can tell,
the cops are actually helping him.

362
00:39:07,841 --> 00:39:10,594
"Crime Wave in Gotham."

363
00:39:10,761 --> 00:39:13,958
Other breaking news, "Water, Wet."

364
00:39:14,161 --> 00:39:15,435
Did you file the football yet?

365
00:39:15,601 --> 00:39:17,478
Why aren't we covering this?

366
00:39:17,641 --> 00:39:19,361
Poor people don't buy papers?

367
00:39:19,481 --> 00:39:21,551
People don't buy papers, period, Kent.

368
00:39:21,721 --> 00:39:22,897
Perry, when you assign a story,

369
00:39:22,921 --> 00:39:24,561
you're making a choice about who matters.

370
00:39:24,681 --> 00:39:26,194
And who's worth it.

371
00:39:26,361 --> 00:39:27,794
Good morning, Smallville.

372
00:39:27,961 --> 00:39:31,590
The American conscience died
with Robert, Martin, and John.

373
00:39:31,801 --> 00:39:32,950
Sorry. I'm sorry.

374
00:39:34,721 --> 00:39:37,838
No match. My guys in the crime lab
never seen one before.

375
00:39:39,481 --> 00:39:41,437
It's called a bullet.
You shoot people with them.

376
00:39:41,601 --> 00:39:44,434
Recovered from the scene
of the firefight in the desert.

377
00:39:44,601 --> 00:39:46,717
Not sold anywhere
commercially in the world,

378
00:39:46,881 --> 00:39:47,916
even black market.

379
00:39:48,081 --> 00:39:49,081
So?

380
00:39:49,321 --> 00:39:51,073
So who gave prototype military rounds

381
00:39:51,281 --> 00:39:52,760
to Tuareg fighters in the Sahara?

382
00:39:52,921 --> 00:39:54,320
You're the reporter. Tell me.

383
00:39:54,481 --> 00:39:56,177
I think that the US government
is arming the rebels

384
00:39:56,201 --> 00:39:58,017
while claiming to support
the elected government.

385
00:39:58,041 --> 00:39:59,520
The Ask, Lois.

386
00:40:04,521 --> 00:40:06,281
Flight to D.C. tonight.
Couple of days there.

387
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:07,800
Go.

388
00:40:07,961 --> 00:40:09,997
Coach. No extra legroom.

389
00:40:12,761 --> 00:40:13,955
Economy plus.

390
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:15,156
Coach!

391
00:40:16,601 --> 00:40:18,671
So, why didn't you tell me?

392
00:40:21,841 --> 00:40:23,115
You're digging up snakes, Lo.

393
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:25,834
It's kind of dangerous.

394
00:40:26,001 --> 00:40:27,912
That is why I didn't tell you.

395
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:29,881
Lane, don't you
have a plane to catch?

396
00:40:30,601 --> 00:40:31,636
Yes, sir.

397
00:40:33,321 --> 00:40:35,630
Benefit for the Library of Metropolis.

398
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:38,713
Someone on the committee
requested that Clark Kent cover it.

399
00:40:38,881 --> 00:40:41,793
Probably some old charity crone
who's got a thing for nerds.

400
00:40:52,401 --> 00:40:53,516
Senator.

401
00:40:54,721 --> 00:40:56,200
Little bourbon before lunch?

402
00:40:56,361 --> 00:40:58,317
My driver's outside. I can't stay.

403
00:40:58,481 --> 00:40:59,709
No bourbon?

404
00:41:00,321 --> 00:41:01,754
Kentucky girl like yourself?

405
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:03,961
Hmm.

406
00:41:04,441 --> 00:41:07,239
My dad always said that Kentucky mash

407
00:41:07,441 --> 00:41:09,352
was the secret to health.

408
00:41:09,521 --> 00:41:10,954
Mmm.

409
00:41:11,921 --> 00:41:13,354
This was his room.

410
00:41:15,361 --> 00:41:16,953
I kept it just the same.

411
00:41:19,361 --> 00:41:20,361
Mmm.

412
00:41:23,161 --> 00:41:26,631
"Maybe one day Dad'll come back
if I just keep everything the same."

413
00:41:27,121 --> 00:41:28,395
That is silly.

414
00:41:30,241 --> 00:41:32,436
The magical thinking of orphan boys.

415
00:41:32,601 --> 00:41:35,035
I'm blocking the import
license for your mineral.

416
00:41:42,881 --> 00:41:44,553
The redcapes are coming.

417
00:41:46,241 --> 00:41:48,152
The redcapes are coming.

418
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:49,830
Hmm...

419
00:41:52,721 --> 00:41:54,120
You and your hearings.

420
00:41:58,081 --> 00:42:00,641
Galloping through the streets to warn us.

421
00:42:02,601 --> 00:42:05,798
One if by land, two if by air.

422
00:42:06,041 --> 00:42:07,110
Mmm.

423
00:42:11,921 --> 00:42:14,958
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?

424
00:42:15,161 --> 00:42:16,161
Can I call you June?

425
00:42:16,321 --> 00:42:17,800
You can call me whatever you like.

426
00:42:18,841 --> 00:42:21,674
Take a bucket of piss and
call it Granny's Peach Tea.

427
00:42:21,881 --> 00:42:22,881
Mmm-hmm.

428
00:42:23,161 --> 00:42:25,959
Take a weapon of assassination
and call it deterrence.

429
00:42:28,241 --> 00:42:29,754
You won't fool a fly or me.

430
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:33,354
I'm not gonna drink it.

431
00:42:38,481 --> 00:42:40,756
You don't think Dad would mind, do you?

432
00:42:40,921 --> 00:42:45,676
If I changed just...
Just one thing in this room?

433
00:42:48,161 --> 00:42:50,436
Because that should be upside-down.

434
00:42:52,721 --> 00:42:54,632
We know better now, don't we?

435
00:42:54,841 --> 00:42:57,878
The devils don't come
from Hell beneath us. No.

436
00:42:58,881 --> 00:43:00,314
No, they come from the sky.

437
00:44:57,241 --> 00:44:58,241
Oh.

438
00:44:58,481 --> 00:45:00,278
I hope the next generation of Waynes

439
00:45:00,441 --> 00:45:02,511
won't inherit an empty wine cellar.

440
00:45:04,441 --> 00:45:07,478
Not that there's likely
to be a next generation.

441
00:45:08,761 --> 00:45:09,796
Thank you, sir.

442
00:45:13,121 --> 00:45:16,272
This is every call made
from the Russian's phone.

443
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:19,115
Two mentions of business
with the White Portuguese.

444
00:45:19,321 --> 00:45:22,074
And it's continually
transmitting blacked-out data

445
00:45:22,281 --> 00:45:25,318
to the personal residence
of Alexander Luthor.

446
00:45:25,481 --> 00:45:28,757
You think Lex Luthor
is the White Portuguese?

447
00:45:30,481 --> 00:45:33,791
I can't see that he needs the income
from imported arms.

448
00:45:34,001 --> 00:45:35,377
Regardless, I'll need to put
a leech at his house,

449
00:45:35,401 --> 00:45:36,550
and I'm gonna need the suit.

450
00:45:36,721 --> 00:45:38,677
The Bat interrogated six people

451
00:45:38,921 --> 00:45:40,673
and came away with nothing.

452
00:45:42,481 --> 00:45:44,631
It was Bruce Wayne
that got the information.

453
00:45:44,841 --> 00:45:47,799
Well, Bruce Wayne can't
break into Lex Luthor's house.

454
00:45:47,961 --> 00:45:49,474
Bruce Wayne won't have to.

455
00:45:51,601 --> 00:45:52,920
He's been invited.

456
00:47:05,601 --> 00:47:07,080
Who's that?

457
00:47:08,401 --> 00:47:10,756
You must be new to
the "let them eat cake" beat.

458
00:47:10,921 --> 00:47:12,513
That is Bruce Wayne.

459
00:47:13,601 --> 00:47:15,831
Philanthropist, bibliophile...

460
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:19,078
True friend of the Library of Metropolis.

461
00:47:19,241 --> 00:47:20,640
Mr. Lex Luthor.

462
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:23,236
Me? Ah. Okay.

463
00:47:27,641 --> 00:47:29,233
Nicky. Uh...

464
00:47:29,881 --> 00:47:31,553
You're embarrassing me.
Um...

465
00:47:32,241 --> 00:47:33,594
Speech, speech. Uh...

466
00:47:34,281 --> 00:47:35,430
Blah, blah, blah. Uh...

467
00:47:36,601 --> 00:47:37,601
Open bar.

468
00:47:38,561 --> 00:47:39,994
The end.

469
00:47:40,561 --> 00:47:42,153
Uh...

470
00:47:43,241 --> 00:47:45,994
The word "philanthropist"
comes from the Greek.

471
00:47:46,161 --> 00:47:47,799
Meaning a lover of humanity.

472
00:47:48,681 --> 00:47:50,911
It was coined about 2,500 years ago.

473
00:47:51,081 --> 00:47:52,639
All right. Where am I going, Alfred?

474
00:47:52,801 --> 00:47:54,792
Go past the elevator.

475
00:47:54,961 --> 00:47:56,280
Do a left.

476
00:47:57,121 --> 00:47:58,236
That's right, must be.

477
00:47:59,281 --> 00:48:01,112
It's in the service corridor
in the basement.

478
00:48:01,281 --> 00:48:02,634
Go down the stairs.

479
00:48:02,801 --> 00:48:05,395
Gods and men.
Prometheus went with us.

480
00:48:05,561 --> 00:48:08,121
And he ruined Zeus' plan
to destroy mankind,

481
00:48:08,321 --> 00:48:09,921
and for that he was given a thunderbolt.

482
00:48:11,201 --> 00:48:13,157
Hmm, that seems unfair.

483
00:48:14,241 --> 00:48:16,152
On a serious note,
the Library of Metropolis...

484
00:48:16,321 --> 00:48:18,297
Go to the stairs. You saw them
on your way in. Down the stairs.

485
00:48:18,321 --> 00:48:21,472
But at one time,
Dad could not buy them. No.

486
00:48:21,641 --> 00:48:23,137
My father could not afford
books growing up.

487
00:48:23,161 --> 00:48:25,561
He had to root through the garbage
for yesterday's newspaper.

488
00:48:28,081 --> 00:48:29,881
All right.
You got the kitchens on your right.

489
00:48:30,801 --> 00:48:32,280
Do a left.

490
00:48:32,441 --> 00:48:34,441
Right in front of you.
That's where you want to be.

491
00:48:50,641 --> 00:48:51,994
May I help you, Mr. Wayne?

492
00:48:53,241 --> 00:48:54,640
I just...

493
00:48:55,001 --> 00:48:57,356
I thought the bathroom was down here.
I must have...

494
00:48:58,161 --> 00:49:01,517
That last martini was
two too many, I think.

495
00:49:01,681 --> 00:49:03,000
Men's room is upstairs.

496
00:49:03,161 --> 00:49:04,276
Great. I'm okay.

497
00:49:05,281 --> 00:49:06,919
I like those shoes.

498
00:49:10,801 --> 00:49:13,315
I can't stay down here, Alfred.

499
00:49:13,721 --> 00:49:15,200
Go upstairs and socialize.

500
00:49:15,361 --> 00:49:17,829
Some young lady from Metropolis
will make you honest.

501
00:49:19,121 --> 00:49:21,555
In your dreams, Alfred.

502
00:49:22,241 --> 00:49:23,720
Books are knowledge,

503
00:49:23,881 --> 00:49:26,554
and knowledge is power,
and I am...

504
00:49:27,401 --> 00:49:28,834
No. Uh, um...

505
00:49:29,001 --> 00:49:31,720
No. What am I? I...
What was I saying? No.

506
00:49:34,081 --> 00:49:35,434
The bittersweet pain among men

507
00:49:35,601 --> 00:49:38,513
is having knowledge with
no power, because...

508
00:49:39,561 --> 00:49:41,677
Because that is paradoxical!
And, um...

509
00:49:44,841 --> 00:49:46,752
Thank you for coming.

510
00:49:48,321 --> 00:49:49,549
Please drink. Drink.

511
00:49:58,881 --> 00:50:02,840
Mr. Wayne? Mr. Wayne?
Clark Kent, Daily Planet.

512
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:04,957
My foundation has
already issued a statement

513
00:50:05,121 --> 00:50:07,077
in support of books.

514
00:50:07,241 --> 00:50:08,435
- Sir?
- Um...

515
00:50:09,681 --> 00:50:12,070
Wow. Pretty girl. Bad habit.
Don't quote me. All right?

516
00:50:12,721 --> 00:50:14,761
What's your position on
the Bat vigilante in Gotham?

517
00:50:16,761 --> 00:50:19,514
Daily Planet. Do I own this one?
Or is that the other guy?

518
00:50:19,721 --> 00:50:22,872
Civil liberties are being
trampled on in your city.

519
00:50:23,081 --> 00:50:24,321
Good people are living in fear.

520
00:50:27,121 --> 00:50:29,237
Don't believe everything you hear, son.

521
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:32,791
I've seen it, Mr. Wayne.
He thinks he's above the law.

522
00:50:35,961 --> 00:50:39,078
The Daily Planet criticizing
those who think they're above the law

523
00:50:39,241 --> 00:50:42,278
is a little hypocritical,
wouldn't you say?

524
00:50:43,401 --> 00:50:45,961
Considering every time
your hero saves a cat out of a tree,

525
00:50:46,121 --> 00:50:48,271
you write a puff piece editorial

526
00:50:48,481 --> 00:50:51,041
about an alien who, if he wanted to,

527
00:50:51,201 --> 00:50:52,873
could burn the whole place down.

528
00:50:53,961 --> 00:50:56,714
There wouldn't be a damn thing
we could do to stop him.

529
00:50:58,761 --> 00:51:01,798
Most of the world doesn't
share your opinion, Mr. Wayne.

530
00:51:01,961 --> 00:51:04,521
Maybe it's the Gotham City in me.

531
00:51:04,681 --> 00:51:08,276
We just have a bad history
with freaks dressed like clowns.

532
00:51:10,481 --> 00:51:11,960
Boys! Um!

533
00:51:12,121 --> 00:51:14,476
Bruce Wayne meets Clark Kent. Ha!

534
00:51:14,641 --> 00:51:16,472
I love it.
I love bringing people together.

535
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:17,641
How are we?

536
00:51:17,921 --> 00:51:19,400
- Lex.
- Hello. Good.

537
00:51:19,561 --> 00:51:21,756
Hi, hello, Lex, it is a pleasure.

538
00:51:21,921 --> 00:51:22,990
Wow! That is a good grip!

539
00:51:23,161 --> 00:51:26,233
You should not pick a fight
with this person.

540
00:51:26,401 --> 00:51:28,817
So, after all these years,
we finally got you over to Metropolis.

541
00:51:28,841 --> 00:51:30,401
Well, I thought I'd come drink you dry.

542
00:51:30,521 --> 00:51:31,521
Well, you're welcome.

543
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:32,897
You should hop the harbor
more often, though.

544
00:51:32,921 --> 00:51:34,081
I'd love to show you my labs.

545
00:51:34,161 --> 00:51:36,197
Maybe we could partner on something.

546
00:51:36,681 --> 00:51:38,831
My R&D is up to all sorts of no good.

547
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:44,750
That's seven minutes.

548
00:51:44,921 --> 00:51:46,832
Looks like the transfer's complete.

549
00:51:47,361 --> 00:51:48,510
- Mr. Luthor.
- Yes?

550
00:51:48,681 --> 00:51:50,353
- The governor.
- Governor.

551
00:51:50,521 --> 00:51:51,840
- Excuse me.
- Next time.

552
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:53,041
Governor! Hi!

553
00:51:53,201 --> 00:51:55,078
Lex, it's good to see you.

554
00:52:33,481 --> 00:52:34,481
Excuse me.

555
00:53:40,681 --> 00:53:43,070
We, as a population on this planet,

556
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:44,561
have been looking for a savior.

557
00:53:44,641 --> 00:53:46,950
90% of people believe in a higher power,

558
00:53:47,161 --> 00:53:48,435
and every religion believes

559
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:50,478
in some sort of messianic figure.

560
00:53:50,641 --> 00:53:53,633
And when this savior character
actually comes to Earth,

561
00:53:53,801 --> 00:53:55,837
we want to make him abide by our rules?

562
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:57,997
We have to understand that
this a paradigm shift.

563
00:53:58,161 --> 00:54:00,550
We have to start thinking
beyond politics.

564
00:54:00,721 --> 00:54:03,281
Are there any moral
constraints on this person?

565
00:54:03,401 --> 00:54:05,232
We have international law.

566
00:54:05,401 --> 00:54:08,120
On this Earth,
every act is a political act.

567
00:54:08,321 --> 00:54:10,198
Is it really surprising

568
00:54:10,361 --> 00:54:12,591
that the most powerful man in the world

569
00:54:12,761 --> 00:54:15,229
should be a figure of controversy?

570
00:54:16,041 --> 00:54:18,509
Uh, to have
an individual engaging

571
00:54:18,681 --> 00:54:20,717
in these state-level interventions

572
00:54:20,881 --> 00:54:22,234
should give us all pause.

573
00:54:23,001 --> 00:54:24,897
Human beings
have a horrible track record

574
00:54:24,921 --> 00:54:27,435
of following people with great power

575
00:54:27,601 --> 00:54:30,832
down paths that led to
huge human atrocities.

576
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:33,640
We have always
created icons in our own image.

577
00:54:33,801 --> 00:54:37,111
What we've done is
we project ourselves onto him.

578
00:54:37,281 --> 00:54:40,796
The fact is, maybe he's not
some sort of devil or Jesus character.

579
00:54:41,001 --> 00:54:43,231
Maybe he's just a guy
trying to do the right thing.

580
00:54:43,401 --> 00:54:46,359
We're talking
about a being whose very existence

581
00:54:46,521 --> 00:54:50,355
challenges our own
sense of priority in the universe.

582
00:54:51,161 --> 00:54:52,389
And you go back to Copernicus,

583
00:54:52,601 --> 00:54:53,954
where he restored the Sun

584
00:54:54,121 --> 00:54:55,561
in the center of the known universe,

585
00:54:55,641 --> 00:54:56,915
displacing Earth.

586
00:54:57,081 --> 00:54:58,799
And you get to Darwinian evolution,

587
00:54:58,961 --> 00:55:00,917
and you find out we're not
special on this Earth,

588
00:55:01,081 --> 00:55:03,879
we're just one among other lifeforms.

589
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:05,520
And now we learn that we're not even

590
00:55:05,681 --> 00:55:09,276
special in the entire universe
because there is Superman.

591
00:55:10,201 --> 00:55:13,671
There he is. An alien among us.

592
00:55:13,841 --> 00:55:14,956
We're not alone.

593
00:55:15,881 --> 00:55:17,951
Are you,
as a United States senator,

594
00:55:18,121 --> 00:55:22,399
personally comfortable saying
to a grieving parent,

595
00:55:22,561 --> 00:55:26,076
"Superman could have saved your child,

596
00:55:26,241 --> 00:55:30,200
"but on principle,
we did not want him to act"?

597
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:32,113
I'm not saying he shouldn't act.

598
00:55:32,281 --> 00:55:34,078
I'm saying he shouldn't act unilaterally.

599
00:55:34,241 --> 00:55:36,277
What are we talking about here, then?

600
00:55:36,441 --> 00:55:38,909
Must there be a Superman?

601
00:55:41,401 --> 00:55:42,516
There is.

602
00:55:55,281 --> 00:55:56,281
Hello?

603
00:55:56,761 --> 00:55:57,796
Mom?

604
00:55:58,001 --> 00:55:59,195
Clark!

605
00:56:00,361 --> 00:56:02,591
What is it? What's wrong?

606
00:56:02,761 --> 00:56:04,752
No. Nothing. I just...

607
00:56:07,921 --> 00:56:09,274
Hi.

608
00:56:11,481 --> 00:56:12,481
Hi.

609
00:56:15,161 --> 00:56:16,799
How come Dad never left Kansas?

610
00:56:21,121 --> 00:56:22,793
Well, he just...

611
00:56:23,281 --> 00:56:24,794
You know how he was.

612
00:56:25,441 --> 00:56:27,238
"What do I need to travel for?

613
00:56:27,441 --> 00:56:29,113
"I'm already there."

614
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:32,879
Just wish it was more simple.

615
00:56:35,721 --> 00:56:37,074
My baby boy.

616
00:56:38,921 --> 00:56:41,276
Nothing was ever simple.

617
00:56:48,601 --> 00:56:50,159
An odd little duck.

618
00:56:52,601 --> 00:56:53,601
Hmm!

619
00:56:53,841 --> 00:56:55,201
I've never seen a metal like this.

620
00:56:57,161 --> 00:57:00,153
Could be DARPA black box.

621
00:57:00,321 --> 00:57:01,834
Who could find out?

622
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:03,719
Nobody who'd want to.

623
00:57:03,881 --> 00:57:06,520
Maybe they gave them
out to the rebels to test in theater.

624
00:57:06,681 --> 00:57:08,831
Using live soldiers as guinea pigs?

625
00:57:09,841 --> 00:57:12,071
This is what makes you
such a good reporter.

626
00:57:12,641 --> 00:57:13,961
Stuff like this still shocks you.

627
00:57:36,921 --> 00:57:39,389
It don't come off!
It don't come off!

628
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:41,355
Prisoner transfer!

629
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,635
You can't put me in general, man.
They gonna kill me.

630
00:57:44,801 --> 00:57:45,937
Hey, you can't bring me to general.

631
00:57:45,961 --> 00:57:47,697
You should be thanking
the tax payers of Metropolis

632
00:57:47,721 --> 00:57:49,040
for taking in your branded ass.

633
00:57:49,201 --> 00:57:50,417
- Sign here, please.
- I'm marked, man.

634
00:57:50,441 --> 00:57:51,857
You know what they do
to people with this on them?

635
00:57:51,881 --> 00:57:53,257
He's only a criminal.

636
00:57:53,281 --> 00:57:55,081
- This way! Let's go!
- They're gonna kill me!

637
00:57:55,441 --> 00:57:57,121
- They're gonna kill me!
- Let's go!

638
00:57:57,241 --> 00:57:59,596
Keefe. You made bail.

639
00:57:59,761 --> 00:58:00,796
Open two.

640
00:58:06,521 --> 00:58:07,670
Who paid?

641
00:58:19,841 --> 00:58:21,240
Who the hell are you?

642
00:58:26,801 --> 00:58:27,801
Just a man.

643
00:58:28,001 --> 00:58:30,356
Yeah? Well, what the fuck do you want?

644
00:58:35,401 --> 00:58:36,681
To help you stand for something.

645
00:58:42,121 --> 00:58:43,554
Your three o'clock's here.

646
00:58:53,561 --> 00:58:55,950
He made me half a man.

647
00:58:57,921 --> 00:59:01,630
My wife walked out on me.

648
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:07,113
I can't even piss standing up.

649
00:59:08,281 --> 00:59:09,794
Let me face him.

650
00:59:11,961 --> 00:59:13,155
You'll take care of it?

651
00:59:14,961 --> 00:59:16,110
Good.

652
00:59:41,801 --> 00:59:42,916
What?

653
01:00:01,441 --> 01:00:02,794
Wrong room, miss.

654
01:00:03,241 --> 01:00:04,276
Secretary Swanwick,

655
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:06,161
you haven't been
returning my phone calls.

656
01:00:08,321 --> 01:00:10,277
Miss Lane, if you'd like an interview,

657
01:00:10,441 --> 01:00:12,830
Major Farris is just outside that door.

658
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:14,872
You're treating me like a stranger?

659
01:00:16,521 --> 01:00:18,113
I'm treating you like a reporter.

660
01:00:18,321 --> 01:00:22,155
All right. Is the US providing
experimental military arms

661
01:00:22,321 --> 01:00:23,356
to rebels in Africa?

662
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:26,430
You know, with balls like yours,

663
01:00:26,641 --> 01:00:28,359
you belong in here.

664
01:00:28,561 --> 01:00:31,200
What's your source on this?
A tin foil hat?

665
01:00:31,721 --> 01:00:33,712
No, not tin. But it's metal.

666
01:00:33,881 --> 01:00:35,553
Fired in the Superman incident.

667
01:00:35,721 --> 01:00:39,077
Experts at the Pentagon can't ID it.
We haven't been told the truth.

668
01:00:39,281 --> 01:00:40,396
Here's the truth.

669
01:00:40,561 --> 01:00:43,241
A reporter got greedy for a scoop
and went where she shouldn't have.

670
01:00:43,401 --> 01:00:45,392
Superman acted like some rogue combatant

671
01:00:45,561 --> 01:00:47,199
to rescue her, and people died.

672
01:00:48,281 --> 01:00:50,920
Don't invent a conspiracy
theory to put back his halo.

673
01:00:52,321 --> 01:00:53,390
Or yours.

674
01:00:54,601 --> 01:00:55,920
- Major.
- Sir.

675
01:00:56,921 --> 01:00:58,195
So.

676
01:00:58,361 --> 01:01:00,238
I logged into your Dropbox to find copy.

677
01:01:01,041 --> 01:01:02,360
There's copy all right.

678
01:01:03,681 --> 01:01:06,400
But nothing about football.

679
01:01:07,401 --> 01:01:09,756
Nothing about the friends
of the Metropolis Library,

680
01:01:10,761 --> 01:01:13,480
just the goddamn Gotham Bat thing

681
01:01:13,641 --> 01:01:15,154
I told you not to pursue.

682
01:01:15,321 --> 01:01:17,761
If the police won't help,
the press has to do the right thing.

683
01:01:17,881 --> 01:01:19,137
You don't get to decide
what the right thing is.

684
01:01:19,161 --> 01:01:21,755
When the Planet was founded,
it stood for something, Perry.

685
01:01:22,001 --> 01:01:25,789
And so could you if it was 1938,
but it's not 1938.

686
01:01:25,961 --> 01:01:28,998
WPA ain't hiring no more.
Apples don't cost a nickel.

687
01:01:29,201 --> 01:01:32,079
Not in here, not out there.
You drop this thing!

688
01:01:34,641 --> 01:01:37,360
Nobody cares about Clark Kent
taking on the Batman.

689
01:01:39,601 --> 01:01:41,353
So apparently Superman

690
01:01:41,521 --> 01:01:43,561
doesn't want us to think of him
as American anymore.

691
01:01:43,761 --> 01:01:44,955
And really, why would we?

692
01:01:45,121 --> 01:01:46,952
Aside from the red and blue costume.

693
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:48,793
And, I don't know, the fact that he has

694
01:01:49,001 --> 01:01:51,276
one-third of the USA's
initials on his chest.

695
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:53,017
I assume the only reason he's not wearing

696
01:01:53,041 --> 01:01:55,236
the Declaration of
Independence as a cape is...

697
01:01:56,001 --> 01:01:57,241
He thinks it's too on-the-nose.

698
01:01:57,481 --> 01:01:59,201
- What is going on back here?
- No.

699
01:01:59,361 --> 01:02:00,794
Guys, come on. Let's go.

700
01:02:00,961 --> 01:02:02,257
Get yourselves together and get out there.

701
01:02:02,281 --> 01:02:03,577
Get those glasses on those trays.

702
01:02:03,601 --> 01:02:04,881
We got thirsty people out there.

703
01:02:14,041 --> 01:02:15,394
I wonder, would you excuse us?

704
01:02:15,561 --> 01:02:17,681
- There's something I'd like to show you.
- I'm sorry.

705
01:02:18,721 --> 01:02:21,838
Now some scholars insist
that it never happened...

706
01:02:22,001 --> 01:02:23,832
But I believe it's the action

707
01:02:24,001 --> 01:02:27,994
perfectly in keeping with a king
who was also a psychopathic killer.

708
01:02:28,881 --> 01:02:32,430
For me, it's the culmination
of 40 years curating.

709
01:02:32,681 --> 01:02:35,639
And I can't believe it,
but I've finally got it here.

710
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:38,952
It's the Sword of Alexander.

711
01:02:40,441 --> 01:02:43,274
It's the blade that cut the Gordian knot.

712
01:02:45,681 --> 01:02:47,000
It's a triumph.

713
01:02:47,201 --> 01:02:48,350
Yes.

714
01:02:48,561 --> 01:02:50,199
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

715
01:02:57,641 --> 01:02:59,199
It's a fake.

716
01:02:59,481 --> 01:03:01,995
The real one was sold
in '98 on the black market.

717
01:03:02,241 --> 01:03:03,276
And now it hangs...

718
01:03:03,441 --> 01:03:05,318
Over the bed of the Sultan of Hajar.

719
01:03:08,881 --> 01:03:10,280
Excuse me.

720
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:13,398
Excuse me, miss.

721
01:03:13,641 --> 01:03:16,792
The other night you took something
that doesn't belong to you.

722
01:03:16,961 --> 01:03:18,360
Stealing's not polite.

723
01:03:19,081 --> 01:03:21,720
Is it stealing if you steal
from another thief?

724
01:03:23,481 --> 01:03:25,039
Who are you?

725
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:27,715
Someone interested
in the same man you are.

726
01:03:28,961 --> 01:03:30,235
Is that right?

727
01:03:30,401 --> 01:03:33,677
I believe Mr. Luthor has a photograph
that belongs to me.

728
01:03:33,841 --> 01:03:35,160
Did you get it?

729
01:03:35,361 --> 01:03:37,033
As it happens, no, I didn't.

730
01:03:37,841 --> 01:03:40,719
The data you copied has
military-grade encryption.

731
01:03:42,241 --> 01:03:44,436
You know, I bet with that dress,

732
01:03:44,601 --> 01:03:47,240
9 out of 10 men will let you
get away with anything.

733
01:03:47,401 --> 01:03:48,629
But you're the 10th?

734
01:03:48,921 --> 01:03:50,400
I'm guessing I'm the first

735
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:53,238
to see through that
babe-in-the-woods act.

736
01:03:54,641 --> 01:03:56,233
You don't know me,

737
01:03:56,401 --> 01:03:57,993
but I've known a few women like you.

738
01:04:01,601 --> 01:04:03,910
I don't think you've ever
known a woman like me.

739
01:04:06,081 --> 01:04:08,595
You know, it's true what
they say about little boys.

740
01:04:09,241 --> 01:04:11,960
Born with no natural
inclination to share.

741
01:04:13,161 --> 01:04:16,278
I didn't steal your drive. I borrowed it.

742
01:04:17,601 --> 01:04:20,513
You'll find it in the glove
compartment of your car.

743
01:04:21,801 --> 01:04:22,916
Mr. Wayne.

744
01:06:16,121 --> 01:06:17,395
Did you get it?

745
01:06:17,561 --> 01:06:18,561
The rock?

746
01:06:18,721 --> 01:06:19,949
Yeah, we got it.

747
01:06:45,761 --> 01:06:47,035
I'm sorry.

748
01:06:48,721 --> 01:06:51,633
Get down! Get down now!

749
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:08,596
No!

750
01:09:02,761 --> 01:09:04,194
She was my world.

751
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:07,872
And you took her from me.

752
01:09:18,681 --> 01:09:20,273
Bruce!

753
01:09:20,521 --> 01:09:23,319
Bruce! Listen to me now!

754
01:09:26,881 --> 01:09:28,075
It's Lois!

755
01:09:28,961 --> 01:09:30,235
It's Lois Lane!

756
01:09:31,561 --> 01:09:32,789
She's the key!

757
01:09:34,881 --> 01:09:36,280
Am I too soon?

758
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,274
I'm too soon!

759
01:09:41,521 --> 01:09:43,512
You're right about him!

760
01:09:43,681 --> 01:09:46,593
You've always been right about him!

761
01:09:46,761 --> 01:09:49,116
Fear him! Fear him!

762
01:09:49,601 --> 01:09:50,875
Find us, Bruce!

763
01:09:52,001 --> 01:09:53,559
You have to find us!

764
01:10:57,881 --> 01:10:59,678
The White Portuguese is not a man.

765
01:10:59,841 --> 01:11:00,990
It's a ship.

766
01:11:03,761 --> 01:11:06,833
Master Wayne, since the age of seven

767
01:11:07,001 --> 01:11:08,878
you have been to the art of deception

768
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:11,509
as Mozart to the harpsichord.

769
01:11:11,681 --> 01:11:14,718
But you've never been
too hot at lying to me.

770
01:11:17,361 --> 01:11:20,353
The White Portuguese is not
carrying a dirty bomb.

771
01:11:20,521 --> 01:11:21,920
What is it carrying?

772
01:11:23,201 --> 01:11:24,475
It's a weapon.

773
01:11:25,201 --> 01:11:26,873
It's a rock.

774
01:11:27,041 --> 01:11:30,317
A mineral capable of weakening
Kryptonian cells.

775
01:11:30,481 --> 01:11:32,241
The first sample big enough
to mean something

776
01:11:32,401 --> 01:11:34,437
turned up in the Indian Ocean
three months ago.

777
01:11:34,641 --> 01:11:36,233
It is now aboard the White Portuguese

778
01:11:36,441 --> 01:11:38,716
being delivered to Lex Luthor.

779
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,474
Who I am going to steal it from.

780
01:11:40,721 --> 01:11:42,518
To keep it out of Luthor's hands.

781
01:11:42,761 --> 01:11:44,080
To destroy it.

782
01:11:45,561 --> 01:11:46,710
No.

783
01:11:49,481 --> 01:11:51,358
You're gonna go to war?

784
01:11:51,881 --> 01:11:56,238
That son of a bitch brought
the war to us two years ago.

785
01:11:57,761 --> 01:12:01,117
Jesus, Alfred. Count the dead.
Thousands of people.

786
01:12:02,681 --> 01:12:05,241
What's next? Millions?

787
01:12:05,441 --> 01:12:08,080
He has the power to wipe out
the entire human race,

788
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:10,801
and if we believe there's even
a 1 % chance that he is our enemy,

789
01:12:10,881 --> 01:12:13,031
we have to take it
as an absolute certainty.

790
01:12:13,961 --> 01:12:15,394
And we have to destroy him.

791
01:12:15,601 --> 01:12:17,831
But he is not our enemy.

792
01:12:18,761 --> 01:12:20,274
Not today.

793
01:12:20,921 --> 01:12:22,718
20 years in Gotham, Alfred.

794
01:12:23,481 --> 01:12:25,392
We've seen what promises are worth.

795
01:12:26,601 --> 01:12:28,193
How many good guys are left.

796
01:12:29,641 --> 01:12:31,279
How many stayed that way.

797
01:12:34,321 --> 01:12:35,754
14 hours.

798
01:12:38,481 --> 01:12:40,949
My name is Clark Kent.
I'm from the Daily Planet.

799
01:12:44,561 --> 01:12:47,280
I'm trying to find out
what happened to an inmate,

800
01:12:47,481 --> 01:12:48,550
a Santos.

801
01:12:48,921 --> 01:12:50,559
I can't give out that information.

802
01:13:08,201 --> 01:13:09,475
Mommy!

803
01:13:13,121 --> 01:13:14,315
Mrs. Santos?

804
01:13:15,961 --> 01:13:17,679
May I ask you a few questions?

805
01:13:18,201 --> 01:13:21,477
He wasn't my husband.
But I know what he did.

806
01:13:22,801 --> 01:13:25,599
But he was a father. He was that, too.

807
01:13:26,641 --> 01:13:28,438
They took him out of Gotham Central.

808
01:13:28,601 --> 01:13:30,159
They moved him to Metropolis.

809
01:13:30,641 --> 01:13:32,313
But inside they know.

810
01:13:32,521 --> 01:13:34,876
They know the mark all over.
Guards don't care.

811
01:13:35,081 --> 01:13:36,400
Bat's the judge.

812
01:13:37,361 --> 01:13:39,192
One man decides who lives.

813
01:13:39,361 --> 01:13:40,919
- How is that justice?
- Talk to me.

814
01:13:41,601 --> 01:13:43,876
- Help me change it.
- With what? Your pen?

815
01:13:44,801 --> 01:13:46,996
A man like that, words don't stop him.

816
01:13:47,601 --> 01:13:50,434
You know stops him? A fist.

817
01:13:55,121 --> 01:13:56,481
Kent, I want to talk to you.

818
01:13:58,721 --> 01:14:00,200
Kent!

819
01:14:00,361 --> 01:14:02,352
Where does he go?
Where does he go, Jenny?

820
01:14:02,561 --> 01:14:04,040
I don't... I don't know.

821
01:14:04,441 --> 01:14:07,433
Clicks his heels three times,
goes back to Kansas, I suppose.

822
01:14:09,241 --> 01:14:10,435
Son of a...

823
01:14:22,921 --> 01:14:25,071
Turn it! Turn it!

824
01:15:08,761 --> 01:15:10,160
Move out!

825
01:15:46,241 --> 01:15:47,241
Go, go, go, go!

826
01:16:26,481 --> 01:16:27,675
No!

827
01:17:52,601 --> 01:17:53,829
Where is he?

828
01:19:13,761 --> 01:19:16,275
Next time they shine
your light in the sky,

829
01:19:16,481 --> 01:19:18,119
don't go to it.

830
01:19:18,281 --> 01:19:20,636
The Bat is dead. Bury it.

831
01:19:22,281 --> 01:19:23,555
Consider this mercy.

832
01:19:25,961 --> 01:19:27,110
Tell me.

833
01:19:31,561 --> 01:19:32,994
Do you bleed?

834
01:19:41,721 --> 01:19:43,040
You will.

835
01:21:25,281 --> 01:21:28,159
I don't have a halo over me,
Mr. Secretary.

836
01:21:28,361 --> 01:21:29,999
I went into the desert, people died.

837
01:21:30,281 --> 01:21:31,953
It keeps me awake. It should.

838
01:21:38,001 --> 01:21:39,641
If you think that Superman is a murderer,

839
01:21:39,841 --> 01:21:41,320
then throw it away.

840
01:21:41,841 --> 01:21:43,593
But I don't believe you think that.

841
01:21:46,681 --> 01:21:48,478
How do we determine what's good?

842
01:21:49,881 --> 01:21:52,714
In a democracy, good is a conversation,

843
01:21:52,881 --> 01:21:54,801
not a unilateral decision.

844
01:21:55,201 --> 01:21:58,273
So I urge Superman to come

845
01:21:58,441 --> 01:21:59,999
to this Hill of the People tomorrow

846
01:22:00,161 --> 01:22:01,799
to see those who have suffered.

847
01:22:02,561 --> 01:22:05,314
The world needs to know
what happened in that desert.

848
01:22:06,001 --> 01:22:07,514
And to know what he stands for.

849
01:22:08,521 --> 01:22:10,671
How far will he take his power?

850
01:22:12,321 --> 01:22:16,030
Does he act by our will or by his own?

851
01:22:23,921 --> 01:22:26,754
People hate
what they don't understand.

852
01:22:28,401 --> 01:22:32,030
But they see what you do,
and they know who you are.

853
01:22:33,521 --> 01:22:36,672
You're not a killer, a threat.

854
01:22:38,361 --> 01:22:40,352
I never wanted this world to have you.

855
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:47,516
Be their hero, Clark. Be their monument.

856
01:22:47,681 --> 01:22:51,310
Be their angel.
Be anything they need you to be.

857
01:22:52,201 --> 01:22:53,873
Or be none of it.

858
01:22:55,641 --> 01:22:57,597
You don't owe this world a thing.

859
01:22:58,921 --> 01:23:00,559
You never did.

860
01:23:03,401 --> 01:23:06,199
This is DeNiros.
Transfer available to Kane Avenue.

861
01:23:06,361 --> 01:23:07,714
Please, mind your step.

862
01:23:37,761 --> 01:23:39,831
I have to speak to the senator today.

863
01:23:40,081 --> 01:23:41,497
You cannot see the senator today.

864
01:23:41,521 --> 01:23:43,137
I need to speak to her
before the hearing.

865
01:23:43,161 --> 01:23:44,761
Do you understand how important this is?

866
01:23:44,961 --> 01:23:46,497
I cannot let you see the senator.

867
01:23:46,521 --> 01:23:48,113
Please, I need to speak to her.

868
01:23:48,321 --> 01:23:51,119
Please, madam. I beg of you!
Please don't do this!

869
01:23:51,281 --> 01:23:52,555
This is so important!

870
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:54,441
- Come with me.
- Don't touch me!

871
01:23:55,321 --> 01:23:57,198
- Please!
- I'm sorry. She wouldn't leave.

872
01:23:59,241 --> 01:24:00,754
I didn't tell you the truth.

873
01:24:02,081 --> 01:24:04,072
C.I. thinks the desert was a setup.

874
01:24:04,881 --> 01:24:06,678
Somebody wanted Superman to look guilty.

875
01:24:08,201 --> 01:24:10,192
The bullet?

876
01:24:17,841 --> 01:24:19,877
The metal was developed
by a private company.

877
01:24:20,041 --> 01:24:21,156
What company?

878
01:24:21,321 --> 01:24:22,436
LexCorp.

879
01:24:23,881 --> 01:24:24,950
Lex Luthor?

880
01:24:25,161 --> 01:24:28,073
He also had private security contractors
at the desert compound.

881
01:24:32,401 --> 01:24:33,720
Go on record.

882
01:24:34,201 --> 01:24:36,795
Not a chance. It's classified.

883
01:24:37,601 --> 01:24:38,875
I happen to like my job.

884
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:40,110
It doesn't make sense.

885
01:24:40,281 --> 01:24:42,297
You said that the ambush was
arranged to frame Superman,

886
01:24:42,321 --> 01:24:45,074
but how could they know
that he'd show up in the...

887
01:24:51,681 --> 01:24:53,558
In the middle of the desert. Thank you.

888
01:24:57,041 --> 01:25:00,556
The Senate hearing is expected
to get underway any minute now.

889
01:25:00,761 --> 01:25:02,877
And of course the big
unknown in all of this is

890
01:25:03,081 --> 01:25:04,196
will Superman show up?

891
01:25:04,361 --> 01:25:05,497
That is what they're really
waiting to see.

892
01:25:05,521 --> 01:25:06,636
Mr. Keefe. Mr. Keefe.

893
01:25:06,801 --> 01:25:08,200
Soledad O'Brien, In the Moment.

894
01:25:08,401 --> 01:25:09,470
Quick question for you.

895
01:25:09,641 --> 01:25:11,297
You're heading in
to meet with the senators.

896
01:25:11,321 --> 01:25:12,549
What will you tell them?

897
01:25:13,081 --> 01:25:16,039
I've come here
to tell them to wake up.

898
01:25:16,201 --> 01:25:17,953
This is flesh and blood.

899
01:25:18,201 --> 01:25:19,634
He has delivered a war here.

900
01:25:19,841 --> 01:25:20,841
And this...

901
01:25:21,921 --> 01:25:24,515
This is what war looks like.
I have nothing.

902
01:25:24,761 --> 01:25:27,480
There are plenty of people,
sir, who would say he's their hero.

903
01:25:27,761 --> 01:25:29,399
He is not a hero.

904
01:25:29,601 --> 01:25:32,195
Grace, can you get Greg up here, please?

905
01:25:32,481 --> 01:25:33,630
Right now.

906
01:25:34,841 --> 01:25:36,481
An anonymous source can verify everything

907
01:25:36,721 --> 01:25:38,518
I told you about what
happened in Nairomi.

908
01:25:38,681 --> 01:25:41,036
- An anonymous source?
- Run it.

909
01:25:41,241 --> 01:25:42,913
Luthor engineered the desert.

910
01:25:43,241 --> 01:25:45,391
It was an ambush for Superman.

911
01:25:45,561 --> 01:25:46,897
Trust your reporter. Think Watergate.

912
01:25:46,921 --> 01:25:48,559
Yeah, and you need to think litigate.

913
01:25:48,761 --> 01:25:51,121
If you're wrong, Luthor will
sue the paper out of existence.

914
01:25:51,641 --> 01:25:52,710
You need proof.

915
01:25:53,041 --> 01:25:54,315
No. It needs to run now.

916
01:25:54,481 --> 01:25:55,481
Before the hearing.

917
01:25:55,641 --> 01:25:57,497
If Superman knows,
it might change what he says.

918
01:25:57,521 --> 01:25:59,557
I am not going to risk the paper

919
01:25:59,721 --> 01:26:01,234
so that you can pass notes in class

920
01:26:01,441 --> 01:26:02,635
to the man that rescued you.

921
01:26:03,001 --> 01:26:04,195
He paid her?

922
01:26:04,361 --> 01:26:07,080
Not only paid her.
He threatened her.

923
01:26:07,241 --> 01:26:08,594
Gave her a script to learn.

924
01:26:09,401 --> 01:26:11,278
Her parents are alive back home.

925
01:26:12,241 --> 01:26:14,038
But the girl's got a conscience.

926
01:26:14,201 --> 01:26:16,057
He's been using the committee
as his puppet theater.

927
01:26:16,081 --> 01:26:17,081
Senator!

928
01:26:17,761 --> 01:26:18,955
Hi, you.

929
01:26:19,121 --> 01:26:20,761
Don't go anywhere. I want to talk to you.

930
01:26:20,881 --> 01:26:21,881
Uh, you know what?

931
01:26:22,041 --> 01:26:24,396
Mercy, you go in and make sure
no one takes my seat.

932
01:26:24,561 --> 01:26:25,676
So what you been up to?

933
01:26:25,921 --> 01:26:27,161
I'm just here to tell my story.

934
01:26:27,321 --> 01:26:29,401
That I was willing to finance
a Kryptonian deterrent,

935
01:26:29,441 --> 01:26:31,121
but a certain junior senator from Kentucky

936
01:26:31,281 --> 01:26:32,475
decided to block it.

937
01:26:32,721 --> 01:26:36,919
Yes, the chair of the committee
on Superman is soft on security.

938
01:26:37,081 --> 01:26:38,577
Greg, why hasn't he been
getting our checks?

939
01:26:38,601 --> 01:26:39,716
He is, Mr. Wayne.

940
01:26:39,921 --> 01:26:41,881
He gets a check from
the Victims Fund every month.

941
01:26:42,081 --> 01:26:43,196
He returns them.

942
01:26:44,641 --> 01:26:46,233
...who lost both his legs

943
01:26:46,401 --> 01:26:48,517
in those horrific events in Metropolis

944
01:26:48,721 --> 01:26:49,949
that happened two years ago.

945
01:26:50,401 --> 01:26:51,550
Jesus.

946
01:26:53,521 --> 01:26:54,874
Why haven't I seen this?

947
01:26:55,041 --> 01:26:56,841
I'm sorry.
I'll get to the bottom of it.

948
01:26:57,481 --> 01:26:59,790
And there he is. Superman is here.

949
01:27:00,081 --> 01:27:02,037
He is actually
at the United States Capitol.

950
01:27:02,321 --> 01:27:04,471
This is really a historic moment.

951
01:27:04,641 --> 01:27:06,552
Now we expect that Superman will give

952
01:27:06,801 --> 01:27:08,632
some kind of a statement to the Senate,

953
01:27:08,881 --> 01:27:11,520
to the American people,
and, of course, to the world.

954
01:27:12,321 --> 01:27:13,470
He's here. He came.

955
01:27:13,641 --> 01:27:15,359
- He's above the Capitol.
- Ah.

956
01:27:16,361 --> 01:27:18,921
You are gonna be on the
hot seat in there, Junebug.

957
01:27:19,161 --> 01:27:22,392
I grew up on a farm.
I know how to wrestle a pig.

958
01:27:22,561 --> 01:27:24,401
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?

959
01:27:26,441 --> 01:27:28,193
It's that power can be innocent.

960
01:27:30,401 --> 01:27:31,516
Good luck.

961
01:28:07,521 --> 01:28:09,398
Oh, miss...

962
01:28:09,561 --> 01:28:11,153
Rudy, she's good to go.

963
01:28:19,921 --> 01:28:20,956
Get out!

964
01:28:24,521 --> 01:28:27,035
- Get out! Get out!
- Superman! Superman!

965
01:28:34,241 --> 01:28:36,081
Another one came
this morning, Mr. Wayne.

966
01:29:14,841 --> 01:29:17,878
Let me say at the outset
that I'm grateful to our witness

967
01:29:18,121 --> 01:29:19,440
for coming before us today.

968
01:29:21,201 --> 01:29:23,271
This is how a democracy works.

969
01:29:23,961 --> 01:29:25,360
We talk to each other.

970
01:29:26,721 --> 01:29:30,430
We act by the consent
of the governed, sir.

971
01:29:32,281 --> 01:29:35,637
I have sat here before
to say that shadow interventions

972
01:29:35,801 --> 01:29:37,401
will not be tolerated by this committee.

973
01:29:38,561 --> 01:29:39,596
Neither will lies.

974
01:29:41,721 --> 01:29:45,111
Because today is a day for truth.

975
01:29:47,001 --> 01:29:48,639
Because only by speaking...

976
01:29:59,241 --> 01:30:03,314
Only by working together can we...

977
01:30:09,481 --> 01:30:10,630
Can we...

978
01:30:20,681 --> 01:30:23,991
Can we create a free, and a...

979
01:30:53,201 --> 01:30:54,201
Oh, my God!

980
01:31:18,921 --> 01:31:20,957
We're back
at the nation's Capitol,

981
01:31:21,201 --> 01:31:22,600
where something is happening.

982
01:31:40,921 --> 01:31:41,921
Excuse me.

983
01:31:42,601 --> 01:31:44,114
Excuse me, officer.

984
01:31:45,161 --> 01:31:47,595
Member of the press.
Can you let me in, please?

985
01:31:55,601 --> 01:31:57,081
Breathe slowly and deeply.

986
01:31:57,681 --> 01:31:58,796
You're gonna be fine.

987
01:32:06,481 --> 01:32:09,917
Thank you.
I'm gonna need a little room to work.

988
01:32:11,321 --> 01:32:14,040
Ma'am, it appears you've
suffered a head injury.

989
01:32:14,961 --> 01:32:17,041
I'm gonna need you
to follow my light with your eyes.

990
01:33:07,721 --> 01:33:09,154
Master Wayne.

991
01:33:12,321 --> 01:33:14,073
Mr. Wayne!

992
01:33:15,201 --> 01:33:19,319
...in the Senate hearing room
where Superman was testifying.

993
01:33:19,481 --> 01:33:22,200
This is a catastrophic
situation at our nation's Capitol.

994
01:33:22,361 --> 01:33:23,681
We don't have exact numbers yet,

995
01:33:23,801 --> 01:33:25,917
but I can tell you that
more than a dozen people

996
01:33:26,121 --> 01:33:27,554
have died in this explosion.

997
01:33:27,721 --> 01:33:28,937
First responders are at the scene.

998
01:33:28,961 --> 01:33:30,758
They are still bringing victims out.

999
01:33:31,001 --> 01:33:35,279
Now initially, Superman was helping
bring victims out after the blast,

1000
01:33:35,441 --> 01:33:37,750
but he seems to have disappeared...

1001
01:33:37,961 --> 01:33:39,217
...raising questions.

1002
01:33:39,241 --> 01:33:42,039
Carrie Birmingham,
reporting live from the nation's capital.

1003
01:33:42,201 --> 01:33:45,001
Capitol police are now
confirming that the blast was caused

1004
01:33:45,041 --> 01:33:47,714
by an explosive device
inside the hearing room.

1005
01:34:12,641 --> 01:34:15,030
Run that one more time for me.

1006
01:34:15,201 --> 01:34:18,079
- Can you enhance that?
- There you go, sir.

1007
01:34:56,761 --> 01:34:59,195
Capitol police are confirming to CNN

1008
01:34:59,401 --> 01:35:00,754
that the suspected bomber is

1009
01:35:00,961 --> 01:35:02,952
Wallace Vernon Keefe. Now these sources...

1010
01:35:03,121 --> 01:35:04,793
Clark, it's me again. Can you...

1011
01:35:04,961 --> 01:35:07,281
...could have gotten
the explosive device into the hearing

1012
01:35:07,361 --> 01:35:09,556
by concealing them inside his wheelchair.

1013
01:35:09,761 --> 01:35:12,958
As for Superman, he was in the room,
but obviously failed to stop him.

1014
01:35:13,121 --> 01:35:14,395
I didn't see it, Lo.

1015
01:35:15,641 --> 01:35:17,552
I was standing right there
and I didn't see it.

1016
01:35:17,721 --> 01:35:19,161
Clark, there are people behind this.

1017
01:35:19,281 --> 01:35:22,193
I'm afraid I didn't see it
because I wasn't looking.

1018
01:35:25,001 --> 01:35:26,275
All this time,

1019
01:35:27,121 --> 01:35:29,635
I've been living my life
the way my father saw it.

1020
01:35:30,841 --> 01:35:32,957
Righting wrongs for a ghost.

1021
01:35:35,321 --> 01:35:37,516
Thinking I'm here to do good.

1022
01:35:41,401 --> 01:35:43,312
Superman was never real.

1023
01:35:44,281 --> 01:35:46,636
Just the dream of a farmer from Kansas.

1024
01:35:48,201 --> 01:35:51,113
That farmer's dream
is all some people have.

1025
01:35:51,721 --> 01:35:53,996
It's all that gives them hope.

1026
01:36:04,841 --> 01:36:06,672
This means something.

1027
01:36:07,841 --> 01:36:09,672
It did on my world.

1028
01:36:11,001 --> 01:36:13,310
My world doesn't exist anymore.

1029
01:37:32,081 --> 01:37:34,072
Welcome.

1030
01:37:34,281 --> 01:37:38,672
Analysis reveals ship
operating at 37% efficiency.

1031
01:37:39,521 --> 01:37:41,591
Would you like to assume command?

1032
01:37:42,201 --> 01:37:43,520
Yes, I would.

1033
01:37:44,201 --> 01:37:46,112
Yes, I would.

1034
01:37:46,281 --> 01:37:48,795
Very well. Let's begin.

1035
01:37:49,281 --> 01:37:54,116
The Kryptonian archive contains knowledge
from 100,000 different worlds.

1036
01:37:54,481 --> 01:37:57,837
Good. Teach me.

1037
01:40:28,001 --> 01:40:32,074
Alexander Luthor,
your security override has been accepted.

1038
01:40:32,241 --> 01:40:35,119
Genesis Chamber ready
to analyze genetic sample.

1039
01:40:38,481 --> 01:40:41,439
Acknowledging presence
of genetic material.

1040
01:40:41,601 --> 01:40:42,954
Analyzing.

1041
01:40:45,721 --> 01:40:49,475
I've identified the host as
General Zod of Kandor.

1042
01:41:05,161 --> 01:41:07,880
Acknowledging presence
of foreign genetic material.

1043
01:41:08,081 --> 01:41:09,639
Analyzing.

1044
01:41:10,281 --> 01:41:12,556
You flew too close to the sun.

1045
01:41:14,921 --> 01:41:16,673
Now look at you.

1046
01:41:18,041 --> 01:41:20,509
Advising. Action forbidden.

1047
01:41:21,041 --> 01:41:23,396
It has been decreed
by the Council of Krypton

1048
01:41:23,561 --> 01:41:26,871
that none will ever again
give life to a deformity

1049
01:41:27,041 --> 01:41:29,271
so hateful to sight and memory.

1050
01:41:29,441 --> 01:41:31,511
The desecration without name.

1051
01:41:31,961 --> 01:41:34,521
And where is the Council of Krypton?

1052
01:41:35,241 --> 01:41:36,356
Destroyed, sir.

1053
01:41:37,641 --> 01:41:38,994
Then proceed.

1054
01:41:39,481 --> 01:41:40,800
Very well.

1055
01:41:41,121 --> 01:41:44,272
Preparing chrysalis
and commencing metamorphosis.

1056
01:41:46,801 --> 01:41:48,553
"And so we are left to wonder

1057
01:41:48,721 --> 01:41:51,679
"if Superman was aware of
the threat and did nothing,

1058
01:41:51,841 --> 01:41:54,753
"was he then complicit
in the Capitol tragedy?"

1059
01:41:55,041 --> 01:41:56,041
Still no Kent?

1060
01:41:56,201 --> 01:41:57,921
"His disappearance
raises questions."

1061
01:41:58,161 --> 01:41:59,196
No.

1062
01:41:59,361 --> 01:42:01,537
There are still so many
unanswered questions.

1063
01:42:01,561 --> 01:42:02,630
Chief among them,

1064
01:42:02,841 --> 01:42:05,514
whether Superman was involved
in the planning of this attack.

1065
01:42:05,721 --> 01:42:07,916
I mean, here's an individual
who has unlimited power,

1066
01:42:08,081 --> 01:42:11,073
yet did nothing to stop the bomber
just a few feet away from him.

1067
01:42:11,241 --> 01:42:12,881
It just doesn't add up for investigators.

1068
01:42:13,921 --> 01:42:15,737
Burn him, burn him, burn him.

1069
01:42:15,761 --> 01:42:18,275
Burn him, burn him, burn him.

1070
01:42:40,361 --> 01:42:43,273
For 20 American, he didn't see you.

1071
01:42:44,801 --> 01:42:45,870
Same for me.

1072
01:42:56,761 --> 01:42:59,798
Now one FBI official
familiar with this case

1073
01:42:59,961 --> 01:43:01,553
told me they found quote,

1074
01:43:01,721 --> 01:43:05,430
"A jackpot of bomb-making materials
inside Keefe's apartment."

1075
01:43:05,601 --> 01:43:07,080
What they need to determine now is

1076
01:43:07,281 --> 01:43:10,478
whether he had any help in the planning
and execution of the bombing.

1077
01:43:10,641 --> 01:43:15,032
And they haven 't ruled out the idea
that Superman was a co-conspirator.

1078
01:43:15,961 --> 01:43:17,189
Now, my sources are telling me

1079
01:43:17,361 --> 01:43:20,398
they are getting a barrage of anonymous
and credible tips

1080
01:43:20,641 --> 01:43:25,510
with all roads in this investigation
leading to the Kryptonian visitor.

1081
01:44:02,601 --> 01:44:04,831
All right, Lois. You gotta go.

1082
01:44:21,721 --> 01:44:23,757
He didn't know he was gonna die.

1083
01:44:25,041 --> 01:44:26,679
He just bought groceries.

1084
01:44:26,841 --> 01:44:28,638
The wheelchair and
the bullet from the desert

1085
01:44:28,801 --> 01:44:30,678
were made from the same metal.

1086
01:44:30,841 --> 01:44:32,121
I know. The desert. The hearing.

1087
01:44:32,161 --> 01:44:34,834
Everywhere Superman goes,
Luthor wants death.

1088
01:44:35,001 --> 01:44:37,469
But, Luthor goes
through all of that trouble...

1089
01:44:37,641 --> 01:44:40,838
Creates a bomb out of a wheelchair,
and then alters it to reduce the blast?

1090
01:44:41,041 --> 01:44:42,633
What do you mean?

1091
01:44:42,801 --> 01:44:45,361
The inside of the chair
was lined with lead.

1092
01:44:47,561 --> 01:44:49,040
You couldn't stop it.

1093
01:44:49,481 --> 01:44:51,676
You couldn't see it.

1094
01:45:34,041 --> 01:45:35,360
Something, isn't it?

1095
01:45:37,241 --> 01:45:41,234
We men of Kansas live on a pancake,
so we come to the mountains.

1096
01:45:42,361 --> 01:45:45,990
All downhill from here,
down to the floodplain.

1097
01:45:46,161 --> 01:45:48,197
Farm at the bottom of the world.

1098
01:45:50,001 --> 01:45:52,879
I remember one season the water came bad.

1099
01:45:53,041 --> 01:45:55,077
I couldn't have been 12.

1100
01:45:55,281 --> 01:45:58,159
Dad had out the shovels
and we went at it all night.

1101
01:45:58,321 --> 01:46:00,097
We worked till, I think, I fainted.

1102
01:46:00,121 --> 01:46:01,873
But we managed to stop the water.

1103
01:46:03,201 --> 01:46:04,839
We saved the farm.

1104
01:46:06,241 --> 01:46:09,313
Your grandma baked me a cake.
Said I was a hero.

1105
01:46:11,841 --> 01:46:15,800
Later that day we found out
we blocked the water all right.

1106
01:46:16,001 --> 01:46:17,320
We sent it upstream.

1107
01:46:18,521 --> 01:46:20,716
The whole Lang farm washed away.

1108
01:46:22,081 --> 01:46:24,959
While I ate my hero cake,
their horses were drowning.

1109
01:46:27,921 --> 01:46:30,640
I used to hear them wailing in my sleep.

1110
01:46:34,081 --> 01:46:36,197
Did the nightmares ever stop?

1111
01:46:38,321 --> 01:46:39,640
Yeah.

1112
01:46:40,681 --> 01:46:42,592
When I met your mother.

1113
01:46:44,641 --> 01:46:47,439
She gave me faith that
there's good in this world.

1114
01:46:49,921 --> 01:46:52,196
She was my world.

1115
01:46:54,881 --> 01:46:56,473
I miss you, son.

1116
01:47:01,401 --> 01:47:03,392
I miss you too, Dad.

1117
01:47:23,241 --> 01:47:24,833
You know you can't win this.

1118
01:47:26,561 --> 01:47:28,153
It's suicide.

1119
01:47:30,961 --> 01:47:34,317
I'm older now than my father ever was.

1120
01:47:36,321 --> 01:47:39,233
This may be the only thing
I do that matters.

1121
01:47:40,001 --> 01:47:43,880
20 years of fighting criminals
amounts to nothing?

1122
01:47:44,041 --> 01:47:46,601
Criminals are like weeds, Alfred.

1123
01:47:46,761 --> 01:47:49,514
Pull one up, another grows in its place.

1124
01:47:51,201 --> 01:47:53,874
This is about the future of the world.

1125
01:47:55,081 --> 01:47:56,673
This is my legacy.

1126
01:47:58,281 --> 01:48:00,272
My father sat me down right here.

1127
01:48:00,441 --> 01:48:02,193
Told me what Wayne Manor was built on.

1128
01:48:02,361 --> 01:48:05,990
Railroads, real estates, and oil.

1129
01:48:06,161 --> 01:48:09,631
The first generation made their fortune
trading with the French.

1130
01:48:09,801 --> 01:48:11,393
Pelts and skins.

1131
01:48:15,321 --> 01:48:16,993
They were hunters.

1132
01:48:33,441 --> 01:48:36,160
So falls the house of Wayne.

1133
01:48:37,201 --> 01:48:40,750
We gotta wait for more
evidence, but the question still remains,

1134
01:48:40,921 --> 01:48:42,036
where is he?

1135
01:48:42,841 --> 01:48:44,991
If Superman was not involved,

1136
01:48:45,201 --> 01:48:46,475
if he's got nothing to hide,

1137
01:48:46,681 --> 01:48:50,276
then why hasn 't he been seen
since the day of this tragedy?

1138
01:48:50,441 --> 01:48:52,097
You can't point a finger and...

1139
01:48:52,121 --> 01:48:54,402
I'm not pointing anything, Warren.
Look. Ten fingers, see?

1140
01:48:54,441 --> 01:48:56,272
If there is going to be a criminal...

1141
01:50:24,881 --> 01:50:26,553
The night is here.

1142
01:50:57,321 --> 01:50:58,515
Excuse me.

1143
01:51:00,561 --> 01:51:01,710
Don't I know...

1144
01:52:04,921 --> 01:52:08,675
Plain Lo in the morning. Lola in slacks.

1145
01:52:10,001 --> 01:52:11,195
Lois Lane.

1146
01:52:13,641 --> 01:52:15,154
Mmm. Come see the view.

1147
01:52:15,601 --> 01:52:17,398
Um... Mmm-mmm.

1148
01:52:17,681 --> 01:52:22,038
Now the secret to the height
is the building material.

1149
01:52:22,201 --> 01:52:25,989
It's light metals
which sway a bit in the wind.

1150
01:52:27,001 --> 01:52:28,001
Hmm.

1151
01:52:30,361 --> 01:52:32,017
And you know something
about LexCorp metals,

1152
01:52:32,041 --> 01:52:33,440
don't you, Miss Lane?

1153
01:52:33,641 --> 01:52:35,836
I've proven what you've done.

1154
01:52:36,001 --> 01:52:37,514
Wow, you're feisty.

1155
01:52:37,681 --> 01:52:39,990
Unfortunately, that will blow away.

1156
01:52:40,161 --> 01:52:41,674
Like sand in the desert.

1157
01:52:41,841 --> 01:52:43,513
You're psychotic.

1158
01:52:43,681 --> 01:52:47,151
That is a three-syllable word
for any thought too big for little minds.

1159
01:52:47,681 --> 01:52:49,672
Hmm. Next category: circles.

1160
01:52:50,201 --> 01:52:55,150
Round and round
and round they go to find Superman.

1161
01:52:55,321 --> 01:52:57,097
Wrong category, boy.
No, no, triangles.

1162
01:52:57,121 --> 01:52:58,520
Yes, Euclid's triangle inequality.

1163
01:52:58,681 --> 01:53:00,672
The shortest distance
between any two points

1164
01:53:00,841 --> 01:53:02,513
is a straight path.

1165
01:53:02,681 --> 01:53:05,479
And I believe
the straightest path to Superman

1166
01:53:05,641 --> 01:53:07,313
is a pretty little road...

1167
01:53:07,521 --> 01:53:09,477
Mmm. Called Lois Lane.

1168
01:53:32,041 --> 01:53:33,554
You came back.

1169
01:53:34,401 --> 01:53:35,880
You came back.

1170
01:53:55,001 --> 01:53:57,231
Boy, do we have problems up here!

1171
01:54:01,401 --> 01:54:03,995
The problem of... Of evil in the world.

1172
01:54:04,161 --> 01:54:05,992
Uh, the problem of absolute virtue.

1173
01:54:06,161 --> 01:54:08,356
I'll take you in without breaking you.

1174
01:54:08,561 --> 01:54:10,472
Which is more than you deserve.

1175
01:54:10,641 --> 01:54:12,597
The problem of you
on top of everything else.

1176
01:54:12,761 --> 01:54:13,910
You above all.

1177
01:54:14,721 --> 01:54:16,393
Ah, because that's what God is.

1178
01:54:17,001 --> 01:54:21,119
Horus. Apollo. Jehovah. Kal-El.

1179
01:54:22,321 --> 01:54:25,438
Clark Joseph Kent.

1180
01:54:27,121 --> 01:54:30,557
See, what we call God
depends upon our tribe, Clark-Joe.

1181
01:54:31,321 --> 01:54:34,279
Because God is tribal. God takes sides.

1182
01:54:34,441 --> 01:54:36,272
No man in the sky intervened
when I was a boy

1183
01:54:36,441 --> 01:54:39,160
to deliver me from
Daddy's fist and abominations. Mmm.

1184
01:54:39,561 --> 01:54:41,358
I figured out way back,

1185
01:54:41,641 --> 01:54:44,838
if God is all-powerful,
he cannot be all-good.

1186
01:54:46,481 --> 01:54:49,598
And if he is all-good,
then he cannot be all-powerful.

1187
01:54:50,361 --> 01:54:52,272
And neither can you be.

1188
01:54:52,641 --> 01:54:55,109
They need to see the fraud you are.

1189
01:54:55,801 --> 01:54:57,393
With their eyes.

1190
01:54:58,361 --> 01:55:00,716
The blood on your hands.

1191
01:55:00,881 --> 01:55:02,553
What have you done?

1192
01:55:02,721 --> 01:55:04,473
Hmm. And tonight, they will.

1193
01:55:04,641 --> 01:55:08,270
Yes. Because you, my friend,
have a date. Hmm.

1194
01:55:08,481 --> 01:55:10,153
Across the bay.

1195
01:55:10,321 --> 01:55:12,516
Ripe fruit, his hate. Two years growing.

1196
01:55:12,681 --> 01:55:14,577
But it did not take much
to push him over, actually.

1197
01:55:14,601 --> 01:55:16,319
Little red notes, big bang.

1198
01:55:16,481 --> 01:55:17,834
You let your family die!

1199
01:55:18,881 --> 01:55:24,797
And now you will fly to him.
And you will battle him.

1200
01:55:24,961 --> 01:55:26,110
To the death.

1201
01:55:27,361 --> 01:55:30,273
Black and blue. Fight Night!

1202
01:55:31,241 --> 01:55:34,119
The greatest gladiator match
in the history of the world.

1203
01:55:34,321 --> 01:55:36,596
God versus man.

1204
01:55:36,801 --> 01:55:38,712
Day versus night.

1205
01:55:39,521 --> 01:55:42,877
Son of Krypton versus Bat of Gotham.

1206
01:55:43,081 --> 01:55:45,151
You think I'll fight him for you?

1207
01:55:45,361 --> 01:55:46,396
Hmm, yes, I do.

1208
01:55:46,561 --> 01:55:49,322
I think you will fight-fight-fight
for that special lady in your life.

1209
01:55:49,761 --> 01:55:52,195
She's safe on the ground. How about you?

1210
01:55:52,361 --> 01:55:55,114
Close, but I am not talking about Lois.

1211
01:55:55,281 --> 01:55:56,316
No.

1212
01:55:56,481 --> 01:55:59,791
Every boy's special lady is his mother.

1213
01:56:05,761 --> 01:56:08,480
Martha, Martha, Martha.

1214
01:56:08,881 --> 01:56:09,881
Hmm.

1215
01:56:10,081 --> 01:56:13,437
Why, the mother of a flying demon
must be a witch.

1216
01:56:14,201 --> 01:56:16,715
The punishment for witches, what is that?

1217
01:56:17,041 --> 01:56:19,236
That's right. Death by fire.

1218
01:56:21,521 --> 01:56:22,840
Mmm.

1219
01:56:29,121 --> 01:56:31,032
Where is she?

1220
01:56:31,201 --> 01:56:32,881
I don't know!
I would not let them tell me!

1221
01:56:32,961 --> 01:56:35,270
Uh-uh-uh! If you kill me, Martha dies.

1222
01:56:35,441 --> 01:56:37,121
And if you fly away, mmm,
Martha also dies.

1223
01:56:37,281 --> 01:56:40,000
But if you kill the Bat...

1224
01:56:40,161 --> 01:56:41,799
Martha lives.

1225
01:56:46,641 --> 01:56:50,031
There we go. There we go. Hmm.

1226
01:56:52,481 --> 01:56:55,917
And now God bends to my will.

1227
01:57:02,361 --> 01:57:04,750
Ooh, now the cameras
are waiting at your ship.

1228
01:57:04,961 --> 01:57:07,111
For the world to see
the holes in the holy.

1229
01:57:07,281 --> 01:57:09,954
Yes, the Almighty comes clean
about how dirty he is when it counts.

1230
01:57:10,121 --> 01:57:11,315
To save Martha,

1231
01:57:11,801 --> 01:57:13,712
bring me the head of the Bat.

1232
01:57:16,961 --> 01:57:17,961
Ah.

1233
01:57:18,201 --> 01:57:20,999
Mother of God, would you look at the time?

1234
01:57:21,161 --> 01:57:23,436
When you came here, you had an hour.

1235
01:57:24,801 --> 01:57:26,632
Now it's less.

1236
01:58:29,001 --> 01:58:30,177
Brooke Baldwin is on the scene.

1237
01:58:30,201 --> 01:58:32,241
Brooke, you're live on the air.
What are you seeing?

1238
01:58:32,321 --> 01:58:33,921
There's something happening at the ship.

1239
01:58:35,281 --> 01:58:37,670
It's sending massive power surges.

1240
01:58:38,361 --> 01:58:40,097
Police helicopters surrounding the area.

1241
01:58:40,121 --> 01:58:42,476
They've created a barricade
around this containment center.

1242
01:58:42,641 --> 01:58:44,177
And we're trying to get
a little bit closer here

1243
01:58:44,201 --> 01:58:45,475
to find out what's going on.

1244
01:58:45,681 --> 01:58:46,875
It is absolute chaos.

1245
01:58:47,041 --> 01:58:49,680
You can see that lightning,
those surges of electricity.

1246
01:58:49,841 --> 01:58:52,560
They seem to be getting
stronger by the minute.

1247
01:58:52,721 --> 01:58:53,995
Daily Planet.

1248
01:58:55,601 --> 01:58:56,829
Lois.

1249
01:58:58,081 --> 01:59:00,041
I have to go to Gotham
to convince him to help me.

1250
01:59:00,201 --> 01:59:01,201
Who?

1251
01:59:03,401 --> 01:59:05,596
Or he has to die.

1252
01:59:05,761 --> 01:59:06,761
Clark.

1253
01:59:10,081 --> 01:59:12,390
No one stays good in this world.

1254
01:59:21,201 --> 01:59:25,035
But as of right now, much of
the city remains in the dark tonight.

1255
01:59:25,201 --> 01:59:26,201
Much chaos.

1256
01:59:26,441 --> 01:59:29,353
Much confusing happening
on the streets of Metropolis tonight.

1257
01:59:29,521 --> 01:59:31,337
Those helicopters are still
surrounding the area.

1258
01:59:31,361 --> 01:59:34,159
I don't know if you can
still see those bolts of lightning...

1259
02:01:36,041 --> 02:01:41,240
2400 hours and 2 minutes.
Subject declining rapidly.

1260
02:01:41,401 --> 02:01:43,312
All procedural interventions have failed.

1261
02:01:48,241 --> 02:01:50,441
Outcome will be death.

1262
02:01:58,201 --> 02:02:01,113
Dr. Silas Stone
suspending all clinical protocol.

1263
02:02:01,281 --> 02:02:07,720
US Gov, object 6-19-82
is successfully activated.

1264
02:02:29,161 --> 02:02:30,753
I need a chopper to Gotham.

1265
02:02:30,921 --> 02:02:31,921
Call the heliport.

1266
02:02:32,081 --> 02:02:33,878
Chopper? We can barely afford a bicycle.

1267
02:02:34,041 --> 02:02:35,918
You wanna chase a story? Go to the ship.

1268
02:02:36,081 --> 02:02:37,441
Superman's probably there already.

1269
02:02:37,601 --> 02:02:40,559
Perry, it's not for a story.

1270
02:02:45,281 --> 02:02:46,760
Jenny, get her a chopper to Gotham.

1271
02:02:46,961 --> 02:02:49,634
And forget the heliport.
Put it on the goddamn roof.

1272
02:02:49,841 --> 02:02:51,115
On the roof, Lois!

1273
02:02:53,721 --> 02:02:55,154
Where are we headed?

1274
02:02:55,321 --> 02:02:56,436
There!

1275
02:03:12,521 --> 02:03:15,479
Well, here I am.

1276
02:03:16,921 --> 02:03:18,434
Bruce. Please.

1277
02:03:20,081 --> 02:03:23,073
I was wrong. You have to listen to me.

1278
02:03:23,241 --> 02:03:24,515
Lex wants us to...

1279
02:03:39,521 --> 02:03:42,081
You don't understand.

1280
02:03:42,241 --> 02:03:43,754
There's no time!

1281
02:03:44,801 --> 02:03:46,154
I understand.

1282
02:05:02,561 --> 02:05:04,279
Stay down!

1283
02:05:04,441 --> 02:05:06,750
If I wanted it, you'd be dead already.

1284
02:05:44,281 --> 02:05:46,078
Breathe it in.

1285
02:05:49,041 --> 02:05:50,952
That's fear.

1286
02:05:53,281 --> 02:05:55,078
You're not brave.

1287
02:05:59,281 --> 02:06:00,919
Men are brave.

1288
02:09:50,521 --> 02:09:54,355
I bet your parents taught you
that you mean something.

1289
02:09:55,201 --> 02:09:57,032
That you're here for a reason.

1290
02:09:58,361 --> 02:10:01,398
My parents taught me a different lesson,

1291
02:10:02,521 --> 02:10:03,920
dying in the gutter

1292
02:10:04,561 --> 02:10:06,711
for no reason at all.

1293
02:10:23,281 --> 02:10:25,749
They taught me the world only makes sense

1294
02:10:25,961 --> 02:10:27,952
if you force it to.

1295
02:11:05,841 --> 02:11:07,638
You were never a God.

1296
02:11:11,361 --> 02:11:13,317
You were never even a man.

1297
02:11:20,121 --> 02:11:23,636
You're letting him kill Martha.

1298
02:11:28,961 --> 02:11:30,917
What does that mean?

1299
02:11:32,121 --> 02:11:33,839
Why did you say that name?

1300
02:11:34,961 --> 02:11:37,475
Find him.

1301
02:11:38,801 --> 02:11:40,154
Save

1302
02:11:40,481 --> 02:11:42,153
Martha.

1303
02:11:44,881 --> 02:11:46,473
Martha.

1304
02:12:17,361 --> 02:12:19,352
Martha.

1305
02:12:23,481 --> 02:12:24,755
Why did you say that name?

1306
02:12:26,521 --> 02:12:28,193
Martha! Why did you say that name?

1307
02:12:28,361 --> 02:12:29,840
Clark! Stop!

1308
02:12:30,041 --> 02:12:31,190
Please! Stop!

1309
02:12:31,361 --> 02:12:32,874
Why did you say that name?

1310
02:12:33,041 --> 02:12:34,599
It's his mother's name!

1311
02:12:35,201 --> 02:12:37,351
It's his mother's name.

1312
02:13:07,761 --> 02:13:10,161
We're not getting any answers.

1313
02:13:10,201 --> 02:13:12,097
We're still right outside
the containment center.

1314
02:13:12,121 --> 02:13:13,190
A dangerous situation.

1315
02:13:13,361 --> 02:13:16,592
Military and police personnel
surrounding the area.

1316
02:13:31,881 --> 02:13:33,234
Luthor.

1317
02:13:33,441 --> 02:13:35,557
He wanted your life for hers.

1318
02:13:36,761 --> 02:13:38,080
She's losing time.

1319
02:13:38,601 --> 02:13:41,069
The scout ship seems to be
drawing power from the city.

1320
02:13:41,281 --> 02:13:42,919
It's got to be Lex.

1321
02:13:43,081 --> 02:13:45,914
They need you at that ship.
I'll find her.

1322
02:13:46,121 --> 02:13:48,430
- My mother needs me.
- Wait.

1323
02:13:49,081 --> 02:13:51,276
I'll make you a promise.

1324
02:13:51,441 --> 02:13:53,636
Martha won't die tonight.

1325
02:14:20,481 --> 02:14:21,630
Master Wayne.

1326
02:14:21,801 --> 02:14:23,200
Alfred.

1327
02:14:23,361 --> 02:14:26,194
Uh, I'm sorry for listening in,
but I've tracked the Russian's phone

1328
02:14:26,361 --> 02:14:27,840
to a warehouse near the port.

1329
02:14:28,001 --> 02:14:29,434
You're locked onto it.

1330
02:14:29,601 --> 02:14:31,319
I don't deserve you, Alfred.

1331
02:14:31,481 --> 02:14:33,949
No, sir. You don't.

1332
02:14:53,761 --> 02:14:56,036
I'm afraid this is goodbye.

1333
02:14:58,161 --> 02:15:02,632
And every time we say goodbye,
you die a little.

1334
02:15:15,761 --> 02:15:17,399
- Take it down.
- Go! Go!

1335
02:15:41,041 --> 02:15:42,190
You have to take it, Alfred.

1336
02:15:42,721 --> 02:15:44,234
Ah, right.

1337
02:15:44,641 --> 02:15:46,757
Commencing drone mode.

1338
02:15:49,961 --> 02:15:54,239
Thermal imaging is showing me
two dozen hostiles on the third floor.

1339
02:15:54,401 --> 02:15:56,596
Why don't I drop you off on the second?

1340
02:19:02,521 --> 02:19:03,920
Drop it.

1341
02:19:04,961 --> 02:19:06,792
I said drop it!

1342
02:19:07,881 --> 02:19:09,280
I'll kill her.

1343
02:19:11,081 --> 02:19:13,436
Believe me, I'll do it.

1344
02:19:16,281 --> 02:19:17,430
I believe you.

1345
02:19:29,961 --> 02:19:32,191
It's okay. I'm a friend of your son's.

1346
02:19:32,641 --> 02:19:34,233
I figured.

1347
02:19:34,401 --> 02:19:35,800
The cape.

1348
02:20:03,601 --> 02:20:05,319
"Late, late," says the White Rabbit.

1349
02:20:05,481 --> 02:20:06,977
Forty seconds to animation.

1350
02:20:07,001 --> 02:20:08,480
Right, wabbit?

1351
02:20:08,921 --> 02:20:12,470
Hmm. Out of tricks, out of time.

1352
02:20:13,481 --> 02:20:16,120
And one Bat head short.

1353
02:20:16,281 --> 02:20:18,511
Thirty seconds to animation.

1354
02:20:18,721 --> 02:20:20,801
Ah. That'll be the cook. Excuse me.

1355
02:20:20,921 --> 02:20:23,071
Uh, Gotham Roast. Well done.

1356
02:20:23,681 --> 02:20:25,672
Hello. Break the bad news.

1357
02:20:25,841 --> 02:20:28,639
I'd rather do
the breaking in person.

1358
02:20:28,801 --> 02:20:30,497
Twenty seconds to animation.

1359
02:20:30,521 --> 02:20:32,193
You've lost.

1360
02:20:32,401 --> 02:20:33,914
I don't know how to lose.

1361
02:20:34,081 --> 02:20:35,514
You'll learn.

1362
02:20:35,681 --> 02:20:36,796
I'll learn.

1363
02:20:36,961 --> 02:20:38,553
I don't hate the sinner.

1364
02:20:39,081 --> 02:20:40,992
- I hate the sin.
- 10 seconds to animation.

1365
02:20:41,201 --> 02:20:43,795
And yours, my friend, is existing.

1366
02:20:44,601 --> 02:20:46,034
I cannot let you win.

1367
02:20:46,201 --> 02:20:48,817
I gave the Bat a fighting chance to do it,
but he was not strong enough.

1368
02:20:48,841 --> 02:20:50,752
So, if man won't kill God...

1369
02:20:50,961 --> 02:20:52,679
...two, one.

1370
02:20:54,481 --> 02:20:55,675
...the devil will do it!

1371
02:21:12,041 --> 02:21:13,076
Perry!

1372
02:21:13,401 --> 02:21:15,073
All right. Stay calm, everybody!

1373
02:21:15,961 --> 02:21:17,801
We're getting reports
there are total blackouts

1374
02:21:17,881 --> 02:21:20,759
in the north and to
the northwest of the city.

1375
02:21:20,921 --> 02:21:22,057
Federal authorities
are trying to determine

1376
02:21:22,081 --> 02:21:24,390
if this is part of
a larger terrorist attack.

1377
02:21:28,681 --> 02:21:31,559
Ancient Kryptonian deformity.

1378
02:21:32,081 --> 02:21:35,357
Hmm. Blood of my blood.

1379
02:21:42,321 --> 02:21:44,277
Born to destroy you.

1380
02:21:47,241 --> 02:21:48,390
Your Doomsday.

1381
02:22:12,121 --> 02:22:17,479
Now God is good as dead.

1382
02:22:20,401 --> 02:22:21,595
Oh!

1383
02:23:40,521 --> 02:23:41,795
POTUS joining.

1384
02:23:41,961 --> 02:23:42,961
Mr. President.

1385
02:23:43,121 --> 02:23:44,337
What the hell is it, Calvin?

1386
02:23:44,361 --> 02:23:46,041
These are live images from the top

1387
02:23:46,201 --> 02:23:49,238
of the LexCorp tower
in downtown Metropolis.

1388
02:23:49,401 --> 02:23:50,834
Military aircraft are on the scene.

1389
02:24:02,641 --> 02:24:04,393
- Are you hurt, ma'am?
- I'm okay.

1390
02:24:04,561 --> 02:24:06,233
Good. You're gonna be all right, okay?

1391
02:24:16,121 --> 02:24:19,397
This thing emerged
from the Kryptonian crash site

1392
02:24:19,561 --> 02:24:20,596
just moments ago.

1393
02:24:20,761 --> 02:24:23,798
Thankfully though, the work day is over
in the downtown core.

1394
02:24:24,001 --> 02:24:25,070
It's nearly empty.

1395
02:24:25,841 --> 02:24:28,878
Now military aircraft.
Those are Apache helicopters.

1396
02:24:29,081 --> 02:24:31,515
They have now just arrived.
The images that...

1397
02:25:07,801 --> 02:25:10,838
We've, uh... We just lost
connection with Metropolis 8 News.

1398
02:25:11,001 --> 02:25:13,435
Now, it's not clear what just happened.

1399
02:25:16,961 --> 02:25:18,679
What's happening there, Alfred?

1400
02:25:20,361 --> 02:25:22,477
How best to describe it?

1401
02:25:22,641 --> 02:25:24,017
Metropolis airspace
has been closed briefly.

1402
02:25:24,041 --> 02:25:25,161
Excuse me?

1403
02:25:25,201 --> 02:25:26,457
We kindly ask that you stay in your seats.

1404
02:25:26,481 --> 02:25:27,675
Excuse me?

1405
02:25:27,841 --> 02:25:29,240
Miss Prince?

1406
02:25:44,041 --> 02:25:45,872
Sir. Look, they've cleared the city.

1407
02:25:46,041 --> 02:25:47,297
Looks like he's taking it into space.

1408
02:25:47,321 --> 02:25:49,017
We can go
straight to Key Red, Mr. President.

1409
02:25:49,041 --> 02:25:50,997
Not yet. Are you crazy?

1410
02:25:51,161 --> 02:25:53,457
They're high enough that we can nuke 'em
with no casualties, sir.

1411
02:25:53,481 --> 02:25:56,871
One casualty, Mr. President. Superman.

1412
02:25:58,761 --> 02:26:00,513
God have mercy on us all.

1413
02:26:07,441 --> 02:26:08,840
- Key is hot.
- Key is hot.

1414
02:26:09,001 --> 02:26:11,401
Red birds are armed to deploy, sir.

1415
02:26:12,041 --> 02:26:13,190
Fire at will.

1416
02:26:13,361 --> 02:26:15,511
Three, two, one...

1417
02:27:04,401 --> 02:27:05,914
Oh, God.

1418
02:27:27,641 --> 02:27:29,438
Projectile 1. Impact.

1419
02:27:29,601 --> 02:27:31,512
Stryker's Island, east of Metropolis.

1420
02:27:31,681 --> 02:27:32,830
That's uninhabited.

1421
02:27:33,001 --> 02:27:34,354
Projectile 2...

1422
02:27:40,001 --> 02:27:41,320
No apparent reentry.

1423
02:27:42,041 --> 02:27:43,918
Projectile 2?

1424
02:27:44,121 --> 02:27:49,514
Superman, Mr. President.
Projectile 2 was Superman.

1425
02:27:50,121 --> 02:27:51,793
Sir.

1426
02:27:51,961 --> 02:27:53,110
It's moving.

1427
02:28:34,401 --> 02:28:36,232
The shockwaves are getting stronger.

1428
02:28:36,401 --> 02:28:39,473
Every time we hit it,
we make it more powerful.

1429
02:28:39,681 --> 02:28:40,796
We can't attack.

1430
02:28:41,921 --> 02:28:43,991
What are you saying, Calvin?

1431
02:28:44,161 --> 02:28:46,391
I'm saying it's unkillable.

1432
02:29:14,401 --> 02:29:16,517
Master Wayne, are you receiving me?

1433
02:29:16,681 --> 02:29:17,681
Alfred.

1434
02:29:17,881 --> 02:29:19,519
It's Kryptonian.

1435
02:29:19,721 --> 02:29:21,837
Only Kryptonite weapons can kill it.

1436
02:29:22,001 --> 02:29:25,391
They might. If you had any left.

1437
02:29:25,601 --> 02:29:27,557
I got one round left.

1438
02:29:28,801 --> 02:29:32,953
The spear. Alfred, the spear.
It's pure Kryptonite.

1439
02:29:33,121 --> 02:29:34,395
It's back in Gotham.

1440
02:29:34,561 --> 02:29:37,394
If I can penetrate the skin,
the spear will kill it.

1441
02:29:37,561 --> 02:29:38,561
It would in theory.

1442
02:29:38,721 --> 02:29:41,872
I've gotta get it to chase me
back to the city.

1443
02:29:42,041 --> 02:29:43,761
Back to the Kryptonite.

1444
02:30:44,281 --> 02:30:45,919
Oh, shit.

1445
02:31:35,281 --> 02:31:37,078
Why did you bring him back to the city?

1446
02:31:37,241 --> 02:31:38,754
The port is abandoned.

1447
02:31:38,921 --> 02:31:40,718
There's a weapon here that can kill it.

1448
02:31:53,441 --> 02:31:54,635
Did you find the spear?

1449
02:31:55,441 --> 02:31:57,318
I've been a little busy.

1450
02:31:57,481 --> 02:32:00,678
This thing, this creature,
seems to feed on energy.

1451
02:32:02,441 --> 02:32:05,717
This thing is from another world.

1452
02:32:06,481 --> 02:32:07,481
My world.

1453
02:32:07,681 --> 02:32:10,832
I've killed things
from other worlds before.

1454
02:32:11,961 --> 02:32:13,110
Is she with you?

1455
02:32:13,961 --> 02:32:16,555
I thought she was with you.

1456
02:35:54,361 --> 02:35:55,510
Clark!

1457
02:35:56,201 --> 02:35:57,520
Clark!

1458
02:36:04,841 --> 02:36:06,194
Clark!

1459
02:36:15,121 --> 02:36:17,510
Clark!

1460
02:36:18,401 --> 02:36:20,392
Clark! Are you all right?

1461
02:36:57,641 --> 02:36:59,757
I love you.

1462
02:37:03,081 --> 02:37:06,676
No. No, Clark, you can't.

1463
02:37:08,241 --> 02:37:09,913
This is my world.

1464
02:37:10,081 --> 02:37:11,514
No, Clark, don't.

1465
02:37:15,361 --> 02:37:17,431
You are my world.

1466
02:37:17,601 --> 02:37:18,750
No.

1467
02:37:22,121 --> 02:37:24,510
Please. Clark!

1468
02:44:29,601 --> 02:44:30,601
Hi.

1469
02:44:37,801 --> 02:44:41,032
Clark had this sent here,
so he could surprise you.

1470
02:47:07,521 --> 02:47:09,113
"The dead shall live.

1471
02:47:10,601 --> 02:47:13,957
"My slain shall rise again.

1472
02:47:16,601 --> 02:47:19,673
"Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust.

1473
02:47:20,881 --> 02:47:24,351
"For thy dew is like the dew of morning.

1474
02:47:26,201 --> 02:47:31,195
"And the earth
shall give birth to her dead."

1475
02:47:38,721 --> 02:47:40,871
Ah, I need a ride
back to the house.

1476
02:47:41,041 --> 02:47:43,714
I forgot my checkbook
to pay the funeral director.

1477
02:47:43,881 --> 02:47:45,872
They said it's all taken care of.

1478
02:47:46,041 --> 02:47:47,872
By whom?

1479
02:47:48,041 --> 02:47:49,633
Anonymous donor.

1480
02:48:33,441 --> 02:48:37,514
All those circuses back east
burying an empty box.

1481
02:48:37,681 --> 02:48:39,592
They don't know how to honor him,

1482
02:48:40,681 --> 02:48:42,592
except as a soldier.

1483
02:48:44,281 --> 02:48:47,796
I've failed him in life.

1484
02:48:49,121 --> 02:48:51,157
I won't fail him in death.

1485
02:48:52,881 --> 02:48:54,439
Help me find the others like you.

1486
02:48:55,561 --> 02:48:57,631
Perhaps they don't want to be found.

1487
02:48:58,481 --> 02:49:01,632
They will. And they'll fight.

1488
02:49:02,401 --> 02:49:04,869
We have to stand together.

1489
02:49:12,161 --> 02:49:15,790
100 years ago, I walked away from mankind.

1490
02:49:17,481 --> 02:49:20,314
From a century of horrors.

1491
02:49:23,001 --> 02:49:26,789
Man made a world where
standing together is impossible.

1492
02:49:30,001 --> 02:49:32,151
Men are still good.

1493
02:49:34,321 --> 02:49:37,154
We fight. We kill.

1494
02:49:38,241 --> 02:49:40,596
We betray one another.

1495
02:49:42,561 --> 02:49:44,756
But we can rebuild.

1496
02:49:45,841 --> 02:49:47,911
We can do better.

1497
02:49:48,921 --> 02:49:50,434
We will.

1498
02:49:51,001 --> 02:49:52,354
We have to.

1499
02:50:15,281 --> 02:50:16,873
The others like me.

1500
02:50:17,041 --> 02:50:19,032
Why did you say they'll have to fight?

1501
02:50:24,561 --> 02:50:26,677
Just a feeling.

1502
02:50:37,961 --> 02:50:40,634
Prisoner A-C-23-19-40.

1503
02:50:40,801 --> 02:50:43,554
The warden wants to speak to you,
so stand to your feet.

1504
02:50:44,961 --> 02:50:46,838
I'm gonna say this one more time.

1505
02:50:47,001 --> 02:50:50,391
The warden wants to speak to you,
so stand to your feet.

1506
02:50:57,601 --> 02:50:59,831
Turn around and face the wall.

1507
02:51:01,281 --> 02:51:03,749
Place your forehead against the wall.

1508
02:51:03,921 --> 02:51:08,153
Put your hands behind your back,
so that I can come in and restrain you.

1509
02:51:36,201 --> 02:51:38,954
Whatever you do, wherever you go,

1510
02:51:39,121 --> 02:51:41,271
I'll be watching you.

1511
02:51:42,041 --> 02:51:43,360
Oh...

1512
02:51:44,641 --> 02:51:46,438
Look at us.

1513
02:51:47,241 --> 02:51:49,152
This is how it all caves in.

1514
02:51:49,361 --> 02:51:54,594
Civilization on the Wayne Manor's
out the window.

1515
02:51:55,281 --> 02:51:56,680
Mmm?

1516
02:51:59,041 --> 02:52:01,271
But who would believe me?
I...

1517
02:52:01,961 --> 02:52:04,350
I'm insane.

1518
02:52:05,681 --> 02:52:07,592
I'm not even fit to stand trial.

1519
02:52:07,761 --> 02:52:09,638
That's right.

1520
02:52:09,841 --> 02:52:13,754
We have hospitals that treat
the mentally ill with compassion.

1521
02:52:14,121 --> 02:52:16,919
But that's not where you're going.

1522
02:52:17,081 --> 02:52:20,596
I arranged for you to get transferred
to Arkham Asylum in Gotham.

1523
02:52:21,801 --> 02:52:24,269
I still have some friends there.

1524
02:52:24,441 --> 02:52:26,238
They're expecting you.

1525
02:52:30,481 --> 02:52:34,679
But the bell's already been rung.

1526
02:52:37,241 --> 02:52:38,754
And they've heard it.

1527
02:52:40,521 --> 02:52:41,920
Out in the dark.

1528
02:52:42,121 --> 02:52:44,681
Among the stars. Hmm.

1529
02:52:48,041 --> 02:52:51,750
Ding dong, the God is dead.

1530
02:53:01,121 --> 02:53:03,954
But a bell cannot be unrung!

1531
02:53:05,041 --> 02:53:08,795
He's hungry. He's found us.

1532
02:53:09,801 --> 02:53:11,792
And he's coming!
