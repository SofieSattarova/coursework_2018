1
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,640
Prince Kenshin, you must turn back.

2
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,645
- Return with us at once.
- No.

3
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,525
Give up your weapon.

4
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,330
Do not harm him. Take him prisoner.

5
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,960
No, you will have to kill me first.

6
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:15,260
Take him to the castle.

7
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,385
Mitsu!

8
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,950
Yeah, baby.

9
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,950
- All right.
- Yeah.

10
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,835
Yo, rock 'r roll. Whoo.

11
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,465
Yeah.

12
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,935
Uh-oh. Turtle tantrum.

13
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,560
- What?
- Uh-oh. Oh, no.

14
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,190
Hold it.

15
00:04:33,355 --> 00:04:35,100
Oh, Raph, come on.

16
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,818
- What's going on, Raph?
- Nothing.

17
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:40,945
Have patience, my son.

18
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:42,700
- What are we doing this for?
- What?

19
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:46,410
Day after day, practicing,
killing ourselves, for what?

20
00:04:46,575 --> 00:04:48,620
- Oh, Raphael.
- Nobody appreciates us.

21
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,870
Nobody sees us.

22
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,165
Nobody even knows
we're alive down here!

23
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,375
Hey, guys.

24
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,000
How's it going?

25
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,337
Hi.

26
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:00,424
- Fine. Good hair day?
- Brought you some stuff.

27
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:01,883
- I love stuff.
- Stuff!

28
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,218
Goodies.

29
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,970
Later.

30
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,055
Let's see what's in the bags.

31
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,182
Here are the keys to my apartment.

32
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,060
- Dude, in here?
- Somewhere. Stop peeking.

33
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,937
- No peeking.
- I'm not peeking,

34
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,523
- I'm spelunking for pork rinds.
- Don't lose them.

35
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,109
- Okay.
- Oh, God, I need this vacation.

36
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,403
- You're not the only one.
- Take us with you.

37
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,821
Come on, take us with you.

38
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,740
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Please.

39
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,451
Sorry, guys, my suitcases are very full.

40
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,244
Oh, too bad.

41
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,164
Hey, I didn't forget about you guys.

42
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,958
I bought a lot of fun stuff
at the flea market for you.

43
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,585
- All right! Yeah!
- Awesome!

44
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,462
- All right.
- Okay, where's Raph?

45
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,213
He's in another funk.

46
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,007
- Again?
- A major funk.

47
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,592
Maybe this will cheer him up.

48
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,428
- Hey, smooth.
- Pretty cool, huh?

49
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,264
- Nifty lid.
- Very Raph. All right.

50
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,516
This is for Mikey.

51
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,560
- Yes.
- Alrighty.

52
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,937
- Let's see.
- It's a lampshade.

53
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,774
- What else do we have here?
- Maybe there's other pieces.

54
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,942
And for Leonardo.

55
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,028
There you go.

56
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:04,946
- Japanese swords.
- Donatello.

57
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,449
This will keep you busy while I'm gone.

58
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,284
- Thanks.
- All right.

59
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,620
And for Splinter.

60
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,747
- Where is he anyway?
- Cool.

61
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,040
He's doing rat stuff.

62
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,792
Found this...

63
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,628
Actually, I don't really know what it is.

64
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,799
Some kind of a weird antique
or something.

65
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,884
I think it's Japanese.

66
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,886
Elvis Presley in Blue Hawaii.

67
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,138
Oh, you're so cute.

68
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:35,060
Ooh, a super androdyne radio
with triode tubes. Boss.

69
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,479
Hey, what's that, April?

70
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:43,026
Some kind of weird Japanese antique...

71
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,320
...egg timer.

72
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,083
Kenshin.

73
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,544
I forbid you to leave the castle.

74
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,713
You have disgraced me.

75
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,382
It is you who have
disgraced me, Father...

76
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,218
...with your unjust war.

77
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,443
Walker.

78
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,826
Walker, you're alive.

79
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,579
Yes, I'd say that was a fair assumption.

80
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:21,082
Survived the shipwreck,
built some new ones and, well...

81
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,960
...here I am, hungry again.

82
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,212
Niles!

83
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,755
Move along, lads.

84
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,757
Yes.

85
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,260
Your sentries, I believe.

86
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,847
Must be a comfort to know
how well-protected you are, Lord Norinaga.

87
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,601
Kenshin.

88
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,520
Inside.

89
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,605
Now.

90
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,375
Children are such a pest, aren't they?

91
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,752
Especially when they side
with the enemy.

92
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,380
Oh, dear. Damn nuisance.

93
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,048
I just keep birds now.

94
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,466
Little finches.

95
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,801
Shut up, Niles.

96
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,513
Right, I have three ships sitting
in your harbor...

97
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,557
...loaded down with powder
and muskets...

98
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,893
...absolutely guaranteed
to win your ambitious war.

99
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,874
"Open wide the gates of time."

100
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,222
Uh... Guys?

101
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,224
Guys.

102
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,522
What's going on?

103
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,149
Wait a second here.

104
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,612
What is this?

105
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,072
Lay low.

106
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,240
Whoa, my face.

107
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,910
Feels like tornado weather.

108
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,620
Wait, the light.

109
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,249
No way.

110
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,380
She's a man.

111
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,924
Huh?

112
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,778
April?

113
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,370
Whoa.

114
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:49,708
Mm. You have that effect on people,
don't you, master?

115
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:51,960
Out cold.

116
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,186
Okay.

117
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,324
Hi.

118
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,786
Wakey, wakey. Wake up.

119
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,581
- Guys, do these clothes look familiar to you?
- What?

120
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,332
Wake up.

121
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,044
Wake up, weird-looking
James Dean dude.

122
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,672
Think he's coming around. Hey?

123
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,303
Kappa? Cappuccino?
No, it makes me hyper.

124
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:47,015
- What's a kappa?
- Ancient Japanese demon.

125
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:51,352
Some were good
and some were very bad.

126
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,606
- Oh.
- Yes.

127
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,608
Demons.

128
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,027
Hey, he speaks English.

129
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,487
Where's he from anyways?

130
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,447
Well, judging from sword...

131
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,200
...l'd say feudal Japan.

132
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,453
Oh. That explains
why he speaks our language.

133
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,371
England started trading with Japan...

134
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,457
...in the late 16th century.
All right.

135
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,375
How did you get in April's pants?

136
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,253
I just wanna know
what happened to April.

137
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:21,883
It seems the scepter has magic powers...

138
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,887
...and somehow transported them
both through time.

139
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,222
Hold on, dudes.

140
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,683
If April's back in feudal Japan,
does that mean we, like...

141
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,728
...have to ride that scepter
back through time to get her?

142
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,981
- Cool.
- You have no choice, my son.

143
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,401
Awesome. But do you think
they had pizza back then?

144
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,071
Get out of town.

145
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,409
What happened?

146
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,036
Coming in.

147
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,167
What's going on, captain?

148
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,003
Ignorant, superstitious fools.

149
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,505
We was just wondering.

150
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,091
Them, you moronic toad.

151
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,552
They seem to think the womars
some kind of witch.

152
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:08,972
- She's some sort of a witch.
- Shut up.

153
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,628
- Some sort of a witch.
- Yeah.

154
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,089
Would you keep quiet!

155
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,639
Sorry?

156
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,934
Look, I took Spanish in high school.

157
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:01,190
Whoa. Hey, easy.

158
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,097
Next time, ask me to turn it off.

159
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,688
Where is my son, witch?

160
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,148
Hey...

161
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,192
...I really don't have a clue, okay?

162
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,195
So why don't you just drop
this macho stuff?

163
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:52,116
Lord Norinaga, allow me.

164
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,300
The daimio and his court believe
that you're a witch...

165
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,970
...who has somehow managed
to spirit away his son.

166
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,888
Is this true?

167
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,225
Yeah.

168
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,476
Yeah, it's true.

169
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,895
I am a witch.

170
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,939
See that?

171
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:27,402
I shrunk four incredibly cool guys...

172
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,153
...and I locked them in there.

173
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,655
Really?

174
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:39,580
Then go ahead, witch. Shrink me.

175
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:46,087
Don't push me, Ruffles...

176
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:51,009
...or I'll melt you
into a steaming puddle of puke.

177
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,892
She has no power.

178
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,978
Let me question her about your son.

179
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:05,523
Then you can roast her, toast her,
chop her into tiny little pieces...

180
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,443
...and feed her to the birds.
- No.

181
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,195
I want her to suffer.

182
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,414
Let's see here.

183
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:25,501
If I subtract the cosine
from the inverted integer...

184
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:29,839
...then I can take the flangeler
and put that here.

185
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,884
Oh, that's it. Of course.

186
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,473
It's equal mass displacement.

187
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,268
See, guys,
for every one of us that goes back...

188
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,188
...someone from the past will come here.

189
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,231
But the problem is...

190
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,276
...that switch will only work
under one condition.

191
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,527
You know what that is?

192
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,654
Tuesdays?

193
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,490
Uh, Groundhog's Day?

194
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,658
Oh, great.

195
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:04,165
It will only work if the magic travelers
each have the same weight.

196
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,335
Bingo.

197
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:11,297
Gee, you guys do have
a good educational system, huh?

198
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,174
Step back, dudes.

199
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,134
I just brought us some heavy artillery.

200
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,183
- Donny, long time.
- Yeah.

201
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:23,935
Leo, how's it going?

202
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,312
Hey, Casey! Welcome back.

203
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,314
Raph, how'd your brain implant go,
good?

204
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,024
What?

205
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,193
- Funny.
- Anyway...

206
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,780
...enough of this camaraderie.

207
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,865
When do we get together
and bust some skulls?

208
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,451
Whoa, whoa. Hold it there, Casey.

209
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,829
You're not gonna do
any head-breaking this time.

210
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,122
Sorry, guy.

211
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,373
- Yeah.
- What was that?

212
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,875
You wanna run that by me again?
How come?

213
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,545
Because we need somebody
to stay here with Splinter...

214
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,880
...in case the time bandit
decides to flip out.

215
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,675
- Yeah.
- If it ain't too much of an inconvenience.

216
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:03,558
- It will be a serious honor.
- It is time to go, my sons.

217
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,184
Donatello...

218
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,353
...we shall wait by the scepter...

219
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:11,232
...every 12 hours,
as you have instructed.

220
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,401
Ah. Correct, Master Splinter.

221
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:17,405
But the space-time continuum
will be out of phase after 60 hours.

222
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,656
Wait a second.

223
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,701
Time-out.
Now, what does all that mean in American?

224
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,037
If we don't come back in two
and a half days, we're turtle soup.

225
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,165
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

226
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,833
Bummer.

227
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,553
Why don't you get a real job, cue ball?

228
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,560
Hey, hey, you know what?
This is a Rolex.

229
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,228
It's a gold Rolex. You want it?

230
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,440
Let me out of here.

231
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:58,696
Shut up.

232
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,824
Hope you don't get shot. Open up.

233
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,620
Stay with Walker, you die.

234
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,247
- You come with me, you live.
- Shut up now.

235
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,791
Lock him up, lads.

236
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,796
Put him in his new home, eh?

237
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,089
You.

238
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,967
Up, fool, up.

239
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:24,013
- Come on. Get your body in there, boy.
- Well, well, well.

240
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,808
What have we got here?

241
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:33,147
Give us a kiss, duckling,
while you still got your lips.

242
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,277
Well, you're not the first one
to do that to me.

243
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,324
There you are, Mr. Whit.

244
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,953
You can lead
your stinking mutiny in here.

245
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:51,499
Good night, me little tweety birds.

246
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,000
Come on, lads.

247
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,507
Goodbye, Whit!

248
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,015
Casey?

249
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,866
Yeah, you look familiar too.

250
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,621
The scepter will be in the temple...

251
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:34,333
...which means you will be replaced
by four priests.

252
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,751
Nothing to it.

253
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,212
Now we must please try to hurry.

254
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,673
Mitsu is in great danger.

255
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,301
- Mits who?
- Yes, Mitsu.

256
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:47,305
She is the woman
who leads the rebellion against my father.

257
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,808
She is the most courageous
and beautiful woman...

258
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,185
...ever.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, we get the picture.

259
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,562
Can we go now?

260
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,063
- Okay.
- Enough Mitsu already.

261
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:59,900
T minus 2 minutes and counting.
Let's go, Mikey.

262
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,111
What?

263
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,241
- Mikey.
- D'oh!

264
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,201
Why are you wearing shorts?

265
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,829
Kenshin switched with April
and got her clothes.

266
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,414
- Yeah, so?
- So...

267
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,916
...this is for whoever
comes through in my place...

268
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,586
...so they won't arrive bare-butt naked.

269
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:19,795
- Oh.
- Oh.

270
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,673
- I got three more pairs.
- No.

271
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:27,845
We have no time
for this scientific debate.

272
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,472
Yes, master.

273
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:32,099
- Come on, guys, let's go.
- It's time.

274
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,435
Yeah, yeah.

275
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,771
Kids.

276
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,522
Trust me.

277
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,691
- "Open wide the gates of time."
- It'll work.

278
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,276
All right, already. Let's go.

279
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,820
Go with care, my sons...

280
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:47,198
...and return with swiftness.

281
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,116
We will not fail you, Master Splinter.

282
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,577
Okay, guys, hold on now.

283
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,787
Here we go.

284
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,622
- It's starting to work.
- Hang on.

285
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,125
Whoa, whoa.

286
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:09,720
Make sure your tray tables
are in their full upright positions!

287
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:14,433
Hang on to your shells, dudes!

288
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,282
This is very bad.

289
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,992
They are not four priests.

290
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,994
They are my father's honor guard.

291
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,705
The scepter was not in the temple.

292
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,416
There must have been a battle.

293
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,584
I knew it, I'm missing all the fun.

294
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:59,103
Where are the priests?
Where's the temple?

295
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,480
Talk about your quantum leap.

296
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,820
Hey, dudes, check it out.
We're in Shogun.

297
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,368
Hey, where did we get these clothes?

298
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,788
These guys are pretty serious.

299
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,711
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

300
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,964
- How do you steer this thing?
- There's no steering wheel on mine.

301
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,049
You're lucky. Mine doesn't have a head.

302
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,719
Watch out for the people.

303
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,805
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

304
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,433
Whoa, this is... This isn't too good.

305
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,727
Whoa!

306
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,898
Oh, don't these things
ever run out of gas?

307
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,608
I think I swallowed a frog.

308
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:47,526
I hope it wasn't an ancestor.

309
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,361
That was fun.

310
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,739
Well, at least the time travel worked.

311
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,657
We're here five minutes...

312
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,285
...and already we lost one brother,
the magic scepter...

313
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:59,413
- Our dignity.
- And no April.

314
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,499
Hey, where's Mikey?

315
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,880
Jeez, what else could happen?

316
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,466
Whoa! Buttermilk. Whoa!

317
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,677
Good horsey. Good horsey. Whaa!

318
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,679
Hey, who turned out the lights?

319
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,850
You know, I think I saw this
on Bonanza once. Whoa!

320
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:19,827
Okay, boys, who's first in line? Come on.

321
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,920
Ancient wusses.

322
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:35,509
Even here, you find me.

323
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:37,970
No.

324
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,140
Put down your sword, Kenshin.

325
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,183
They are not enemies...

326
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,144
...only lost warriors...

327
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,438
...like yourself.

328
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,740
Okay, so far, this disguise is working.

329
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,200
But remember, we're turtles,
not honor guards.

330
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,328
Oh, thanks for pointing that out, Leo.

331
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,622
That would explain the large shell
on my back.

332
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,999
Well, you don't have to be so sarcastic.

333
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,376
Well, I'm sorry, Leo,
but that's my nature.

334
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,510
You see, Walker,
we do not need your help.

335
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:21,263
We are victorious without your guns.

336
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:25,184
Today my honor guard
carried my own secret weapon.

337
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,770
Really? Well, that's very good news.

338
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,397
Where are my honor guards?

339
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,609
Murata, find my honor guards.

340
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:34,818
- Yes.
- Now.

341
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,362
Right away.

342
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,535
- You.
- What?

343
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,621
Come here, now.

344
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:49,083
Uh-oh. Told you these outfits
would get us in trouble.

345
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,918
- Let's go. Blend in.
- Yeah, right.

346
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,338
They're coming.
They're behind the wagon.

347
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,757
Step aside.

348
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,555
Uh-oh.

349
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,265
Go! Idiot.

350
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,772
That's very impressive, my lord.

351
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,357
This is very bad.

352
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,278
Well, they fell for it.

353
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,781
Shh. Want to keep it down, Leo?

354
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,324
So they've gone missing.

355
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,993
I mean, war does have a habit
of doing that to people.

356
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,788
- It's time to look to the future.
- You do not understand.

357
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,916
My honor guard carried
a sacred family relic to ensure victory.

358
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,960
Ah, yes, the golden scepter.

359
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,087
Well, one does hear things.

360
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:39,508
Secrets leak like a stink from a dead pig.

361
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:43,095
You certainly can turn a phrase, my lord.

362
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,304
Listen to me, daimio.

363
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:47,474
Guns ensure victory,
not some ancestral good-luck charm.

364
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:50,144
You are wrong.
If the scepter's lost, my clan is lost.

365
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:54,648
And you, Walker, will have no one
to trade with but yourself.

366
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,818
Niles!

367
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:05,159
- Captain?
- Bring me the woman.

368
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,205
Come on, guys, let's find the temple.

369
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:12,124
Maybe April's still in there.

370
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:15,544
Boy, Kenshirs dad
must be really seriously rich.

371
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:19,339
I think I saw this place once
on Lifestyles of the Rich and Dangerous.

372
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,508
"Bring me the woman, Niles.

373
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,343
Lick my boots, Niles.

374
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,053
Feed my birds, Niles."

375
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,431
What's next, roll over and play dead?

376
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,684
What are you looking at,
you ugly lump of dung?

377
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:31,894
What?

378
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:36,607
Lump of dung, huh?

379
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,529
Oh, yeah.

380
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,157
Oh, you dirty... I ought to...

381
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,286
Later, Popeye.

382
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,996
I'm gonna get that guy.

383
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,956
Did you hear what he called me, Leo?

384
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,417
Yeah, an ugly lump of dung.

385
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,003
That was an insult, Leo.

386
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,379
Not necessarily, Raph.

387
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:02,591
Did you know that in some countries,
dung is used as a fuel source?

388
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,551
"Dung is used as a fuel source."

389
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,386
Thanks, Don.

390
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,847
Ohayou, wasabi.

391
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,349
Hello, mustard?

392
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:13,852
Okay, so my Japanese is a little rusty.

393
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,480
Suzuki, Kawasa...

394
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,565
How about sayonara?

395
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,276
- That'll work. Yeah.
- Ciao. Adios.

396
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:23,862
See you later. Yes.

397
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,078
It's me again, Fatso-san.

398
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,746
Open up.

399
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,748
Hurry up.

400
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,088
Woman.

401
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:45,217
- Yeah.
- We want woman.

402
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,220
Move it, you sot.

403
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:52,474
Yell loud enough,
they'll do anything for you.

404
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,770
There they are, the Three Stooges.

405
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,439
Yeah, Larry, Curly and Moe.

406
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,609
Get her down, you fat sot.

407
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,528
- Beat it.
- See you later.

408
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,947
Don't ruffle me little duck's feathers.

409
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,783
I'll ruffle myself.

410
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,578
Hurry up.

411
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:19,042
Hey.
It's wet willy time, Moe.

412
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:22,504
Wet what?

413
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:29,553
What a maroon.
Hey, what's up, April?

414
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,555
- Oh, hi, April.
- Yo, April.

415
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,807
Raph? Leo?

416
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:37,561
Boy, some vacation.
I'd fire my travel agent.

417
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,605
- Not me. I think it's cool.
- Hey, fat boy.

418
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,734
Oh, yeah.

419
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,903
Yeah?

420
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:47,905
Uh-oh.

421
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:51,909
Yeah, get him in there.
Hey, don't forget to pack a lunch.

422
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,494
Matter of fact, pack three.

423
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,331
Wow, he can actually lift that thing.

424
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,333
- That's impressive.
- Hey, hello? Hey.

425
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,543
- Hey, nice clothes, April.
- What?

426
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,838
Would somebody please tell me
what the heck is going on around here?

427
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,632
Well, relax, April.

428
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,091
It's just your ordinary...

429
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,011
...time-travel-equal-mass-displacement
kind of thing.

430
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,096
- Yeah, what he said.
- Oh, okay.

431
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,182
So let's get out of here now.

432
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,934
Okay, let's go.

433
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,937
Wait, wait, miss!

434
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,023
Miss, cut me loose.
They'll hang me here.

435
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,985
This is my favorite part.

436
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,112
- Yeah.
- Come on.

437
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,867
Next.

438
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,670
I know I'm gonna regret this.

439
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,755
Hey, come and get me. Come on.

440
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,007
- Watch your head.
- Well, come on.

441
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,801
Hurry.

442
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:52,886
Hey, see you next time.

443
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,429
Hey, watch for me.

444
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,058
- Throw it over here. Thank you.
- On your left, Donny!

445
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,559
Whoa, appreciate that.

446
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:07,401
Hey, think these guys have
ever seen a pinball machine before?

447
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:10,112
- Why?
- Just throw them to me.

448
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,155
Tilt.

449
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,909
Fight's over, we're closed.

450
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,829
- These guys are really pushy.
- You're a big help.

451
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,414
They don't know when to quit.

452
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:24,001
- What are you doing, April?
- Come on, I think I found a way ou...

453
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:28,046
Obviously not the age of chivalry.

454
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,840
- Come on!
- Go go, go!

455
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,341
- We're right behind you.
- Hurry up.

456
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,010
Oh, yuck.

457
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,556
- Oh, no, not another sewer.
- Take off.

458
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,268
I'll be back.

459
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,863
Garbage.

460
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,455
Boy, do I hate spinach.

461
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,542
Raph?

462
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,340
Well, I'm in there.

463
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,967
Donny?

464
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,802
Yeah?

465
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:29,024
Mud wrestling is definitely
a spectator sport.

466
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,110
Gross.

467
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,320
Grosser.

468
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:34,821
April!

469
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:37,032
- Yo!
- Here.

470
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,617
Hey.

471
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,078
Help me up.

472
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,496
All right, I'm coming.

473
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:43,663
I'm on my way over.

474
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,540
- Little mud, no problem.
- Help me.

475
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,167
I can handle... Whoa!

476
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,670
Wait, wait.

477
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,047
I'm getting...

478
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:55,550
This was the worst rescue
I have ever had.

479
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:58,678
Help, I'm a turtle and I can't get up.

480
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,473
Thanks.

481
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,974
We'd better get out of here.

482
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,810
Look on the bright side, April.

483
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,479
We could've fallen into a big
greasy, smelly pile of...

484
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,815
Don't even say it, Don.

485
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,949
Hello?

486
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:38,969
Oh, hello.

487
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:42,013
Oh, that hurts.

488
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,978
What a head popper.

489
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,148
Earth to me.

490
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,572
God, my neck hurts.

491
00:35:58,739 --> 00:35:59,948
My spots hurt.

492
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,993
Even my bandanna hurts.

493
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:06,121
Hey, little one.

494
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,790
Okay.

495
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,209
Hey, where am I?

496
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,004
Mikey!

497
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,006
Mikey!

498
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,217
Yo, Michaelangelo!

499
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,470
Hey, Mikey!

500
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,976
Yes.

501
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,477
Much better.

502
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:32,856
- Wow. A leg-o-rama.
- Yeah, I'll say.

503
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,233
Hey, I'm allowed.

504
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:36,776
I'm on vacation.

505
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,820
- Right.
- Oh.

506
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:42,449
- Absolutely. Schwing!
- Absolutely. Schwing!

507
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,923
Hey, Leo. Look at this water.

508
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,467
- Well, I don't see anything.
- Hey.

509
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,177
- Hey.
- Exactly.

510
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,471
- No tires, no beer cans...
- There's a good...

511
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,766
...throwing rock there. Yeah, a flat one.
No dead fish.

512
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,060
- Just water.
- Two, three, four...

513
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:14,314
- Clean, clear, beautiful water.
...five, six, seven.

514
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,861
Nature. I love it.

515
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,321
Makes me wanna...

516
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:25,033
...I don't know, migrate or something.

517
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,454
Turtles don't migrate, Raph. Birds do.

518
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,666
Hey, I got a beak, don't I?

519
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:33,875
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

520
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,378
Okay, turtles, let's move out.

521
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:37,921
You bet.

522
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,174
Whoa.

523
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,509
Ambush!

524
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,345
Here comes trouble, guys.

525
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,638
Come on.

526
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,307
Show me what you got.

527
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,277
Come on, guys.

528
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,821
A one and a two.

529
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,662
Ha-ha! Enjoy your swim, fellas.

530
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,048
Miss me?

531
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,058
Hey, you like baseball here?

532
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,268
Strike one.

533
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,728
Strike two.

534
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:37,355
You're out of there. I love that game.

535
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,899
Okay, I've had enough.

536
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,739
Come on, Jack.

537
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:49,075
It's Hammer time.

538
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,329
Missed.

539
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,955
Hey.

540
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,756
Here, hold these. Thank you.

541
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,051
Wanna dance?

542
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,356
What?

543
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,566
Oh, no.

544
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:29,157
No, no, no, lady. That ain't nice.

545
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,459
Hey, who blew the whistle?

546
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,711
Hey, look.

547
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,133
Hey, we're friends, okay?

548
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,762
We're here to find our brother, that's all.

549
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:54,974
Hey, I don't kiss on the first date, lady.

550
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:58,311
- Raph, give it a rest, will you?
- Yeah.

551
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,855
Don't be afraid.

552
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,736
You are just like the other one.

553
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,405
- Say what?
- The other one?

554
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,614
Mikey?

555
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:12,409
- What? Bingo.
- Oh, yes.

556
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,829
- Yes!
- Yes! Our search is over!

557
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:20,667
- Get down with your turtle self.
- Oh, yeah.

558
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,441
They say your friends
are devils or demons.

559
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,776
Hey, pal, you got a relative in Brooklyn?

560
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,611
- No.
- I figure...

561
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:52,949
I figure they're mercenaries in disguise,
come to help the rebels.

562
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,534
Invaders from the north.

563
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:01,833
My village.

564
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,214
Mikey!

565
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,382
Go!

566
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:21,978
Find Kenshin. Fire over their heads
and burn this place to the ground.

567
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:26,065
There's a reward for the man
who brings me the scepter. Go!

568
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:29,903
Do it!

569
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,367
Go!

570
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:44,250
Yoshi! Yoshi! Yoshi!

571
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,085
Gunfire?

572
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,546
Whoa, better cover the melon.

573
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,924
I gotta get out of here.

574
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:02,894
- Burn it to the ground! Yes!
- I'll stay with you!

575
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,607
It's one of them honor guards.

576
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,275
There's a reward for him.

577
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:18,034
Greetings from Her Majesty.

578
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:24,707
My heroes.

579
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:31,297
Wait, wait!
I'm really a beautiful princess in disguise!

580
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,715
Oh, swords.

581
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,218
- Where's my lord?
- These things have got out!

582
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,886
Break the spell.

583
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,180
Give me a kiss.

584
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:40,682
- No! No!
- My lord!

585
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,600
- My lord, we've seen a monster.
- What?

586
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:45,812
- With a bright green head.
- What do you mean a monster, a demon?

587
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,064
Hey, which way did they go?

588
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,317
Excuse me, Niles.

589
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,403
Shouldrt you be trying
to scare somebody?

590
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,154
But there's a demon up the road.

591
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:59,158
A wild beast with the body of a man
and the head of the devil himself.

592
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,536
Listen to me, you cretinous idiot.

593
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:04,414
It's nothing but a samurai
wearing one of his masks.

594
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,541
- But...
- Shut up!

595
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,543
Get on with it.

596
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,795
- Come on.
- What do we do?

597
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,675
What the...?

598
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,971
Clint Eastwoo...?

599
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:21,931
Nah.

600
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:23,933
Huh?

601
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:39,949
Hey, butch.

602
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,993
Don't you know Westerns are dead?

603
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,162
Speaking of dead.

604
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,379
I'll save you, captain.

605
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,717
- Hi there.
- When I said Westerns were dead...

606
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,553
...what I meant was they're not dead.
I forgot about Clint.

607
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,722
You look a lot like Clint. Yes, you do.

608
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:04,766
Eeeee!

609
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,601
Wet willy.

610
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,313
Sorry, captain.

611
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:13,483
- Eh?
- Yes.

612
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:17,070
Dudes, most excellent timing.

613
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,164
Split up.

614
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,592
Hold it right there, Zorro dude.

615
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,605
He's getting away.

616
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,698
- Wimp.
- Captain!

617
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,117
Don't leave me here! Captain!

618
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:05,952
Wait for m...!

619
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:11,791
Help! Grandfather, help!

620
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,127
Yoshi! Yoshi!

621
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:17,588
- Help! Grandfather, help!
- Easy, easy.

622
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:18,881
Yoshi.

623
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:20,675
Grandson.

624
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,345
Stay right here.

625
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,770
- Yoshi.
- Yoshi?

626
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:34,647
Yoshi?

627
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,945
- I don't think I'm cut out for this hero stuff.
- Michaelangelo.

628
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,489
Need some water. They're gonna need...

629
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,116
What's going on?

630
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:49,328
Well, here I go!

631
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:51,164
I don't believe it. He went in.

632
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:52,999
Mikey, no!

633
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,417
Mikey!

634
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,335
- Mikey!
- No!

635
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,178
We gotta do something.

636
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,897
Kurt Russell, eat your heart out.

637
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:21,027
I think he's gonna be okay.

638
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:29,202
Yoshi.

639
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:33,372
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

640
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:37,251
- You scared me half to death.
- Scared me half to death.

641
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:38,544
- Mikey!
- Hey!

642
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,671
- Mikey!
- God, I'm so glad to see you.

643
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,256
- I was so worried.
- Yoshi?

644
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:45,218
I can't believe you did that.
You're a hero.

645
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:47,512
He has no life in him.

646
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:51,140
- What's going on?
- Yoshi? Yoshi?

647
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,059
Give him to me.

648
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:54,685
Let me take him, please.

649
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,604
Yoshi?

650
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,398
Keep everyone back.

651
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,567
- Stay back.
- Give the guy some room.

652
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:03,152
- Give me room.
- Give him room.

653
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,738
- Everybody get back.
- Give him some room.

654
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,918
- No.
- No, wait.

655
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,253
Let him try.

656
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,005
No. He's casting an evil spell.

657
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:25,424
No, it's not an evil spell.
He's helping.

658
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,845
Keep back, everyone.
I need more time.

659
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:34,141
Come on, guys. Help him out.

660
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,603
Come on, Leo. You can do it.

661
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:55,454
One, two, three, four, five.

662
00:47:57,457 --> 00:48:00,167
One, two, three...

663
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:01,669
Yeah.

664
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:06,924
- Thattaboy, Leo. He did it.
- All right.

665
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:08,593
Yes.

666
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:11,512
Yoshi.

667
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:15,725
Yeah.

668
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:19,228
You're gonna be okay, Yoshi.

669
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,192
Here you go.

670
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,194
Yoshi?

671
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:29,906
Yoshi.

672
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:34,160
Outstanding, dude.

673
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,995
Thanks.

674
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:40,750
Yeah, I just hope these village people
won't be afraid of us anymore.

675
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,974
Well, it's a start.

676
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:04,607
Your men showed lack of courage today.

677
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:08,527
They were frightened by the demons,
as were your men.

678
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,529
Is that so?

679
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:13,658
Walker.

680
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,868
Look.

681
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,872
Tell me...

682
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,541
...were the demons today not men?

683
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:25,044
Real demons?

684
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:26,712
I don't know.

685
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:30,341
Old priests say...

686
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:35,304
...once before,
demons defeated my ancestors.

687
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,351
Now they've come back for me.

688
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:47,400
I agree to your price.

689
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:50,736
Guns for silver and silk.

690
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:53,656
Uh... Guns for gold.

691
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,075
Now there are demons.
Before there were just men.

692
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,743
No.

693
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:01,664
My cannons can destroy these monsters,
my lord.

694
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,916
You can rewrite history.

695
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,005
No.

696
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:20,933
Then I can rewrite you.

697
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:25,479
Whoa, slow down!
Clothesline! Clothesline!

698
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:28,607
Wipeout.

699
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:31,277
Whoa, Silver!

700
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:34,780
Horses.

701
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:38,409
I hate horses!

702
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:41,495
Somebody dial 911.

703
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:43,372
Medic.

704
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,041
You thirsty?

705
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:48,002
Oh, no. My butt.

706
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:51,130
You didn't find the scepter, did you?

707
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,798
No. It's history.

708
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,301
Huh?

709
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,011
Yee-haw!

710
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,721
Adios, amigos.

711
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:02,141
You know, sometimes I hate that guy.

712
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,018
Yeah.

713
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,145
- Let's see.
- You know, wait.

714
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,731
- Let's just hold it here, okay?
- The square root of...

715
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,691
If the scepter wasn't in the woods...

716
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,318
...maybe the daimio has it.

717
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,862
No. He's been looking for it too.

718
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,655
So, what are we gonna do?

719
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:18,824
How are we gonna get home?

720
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:20,659
Wait, wait. Bros, listen.

721
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:22,620
Are you sure this isn't a dumb thing
to do?

722
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,455
No, it's a smart thing to do.

723
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,999
Losing the old scepter
was a dumb thing to do.

724
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:29,001
I didn't lose it, okay?

725
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,587
I, like, had my head totally torqued.

726
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,380
Besides, I know what it looks like.

727
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:36,467
I was holding on to it last,
and it doesn't look like this.

728
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,428
- Don't look at me that way.
- You don't know what you're talking about.

729
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:42,181
- Excuse me.
- I'm the one who said that...

730
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:45,267
- Hey.
- No, you don't... What?

731
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:48,354
I don't mean
to spoil your little party here.

732
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,610
This is your plan?

733
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,071
- Yeah.
- You're not seriously suggesting that...

734
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:00,825
...Donatello is gonna make an incredibly
arcane time-travel machine, are you?

735
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:03,953
- Of course not.
- No way.

736
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,539
- That would be totally bogus.
- Really stupid.

737
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:07,873
Well, that's a relief.

738
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:10,042
No, that guy's gonna make it.

739
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,671
He's good with his hands.

740
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,217
What?

741
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:19,969
- Hey.
- Come on, April.

742
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,345
- What up...?
- Where you going?

743
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:22,888
Where you going, dudette?

744
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:25,057
To find an apartment.

745
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:29,061
I have a feeling we're gonna be here
for a very long time.

746
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,230
- Apartment?
- Are there apartments in Japan?

747
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:34,608
- Do I look like a real estate agent?
- What about condos, time-shares?

748
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,068
Let's get back at this.

749
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:52,209
Take me with you.

750
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:54,545
Where? New York?

751
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:57,006
No. You wouldn't fit in.

752
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:58,841
I mean...

753
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,926
Well, actually, you would fit in.

754
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:04,013
But you wouldn't really fit in.
You know what I mean?

755
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,015
You could teach me.

756
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,225
No, I couldn't.

757
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,978
Look, Whit...

758
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:14,773
...l'm going back real soon and...

759
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:18,444
I don't wanna have
this conversation, okay?

760
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:35,044
Take whatever you guys need, all right?

761
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,553
Hey, Ken.
Maybe you ought to try a little decaf?

762
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,805
Kenshin is unappy.

763
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:50,309
He believes they will never get home.

764
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:54,313
Well, it ain't exactly a quick jaunt
across the Brooklyn Bridge, is it?

765
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,736
Hey, Ken.

766
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:04,156
Maybe you ought to try a little herbal,
Ken-man. Know what I mean?

767
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,158
We can't wait for your sons.

768
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:09,078
Mitsu needs me now.

769
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,750
The scepter. Please.

770
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,852
Can you believe it?

771
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,605
We're not even in the playoffs yet.

772
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:42,528
The space-time continuum
will be out of phase after 60 hours.

773
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,947
Pick up the pace, Smithy-san.

774
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,866
We gotta have that scepter done
by tonight.

775
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,536
No.

776
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:53,664
Love it.

777
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,210
You know, there is one
little improvement...

778
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:02,256
We're talking franchises here, bud.

779
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:05,759
All you gotta do is keep your delivery
to under 30 minutes.

780
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:08,971
Let's see what we got here. We got a...

781
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:12,016
Ah.

782
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:13,225
Pizza.

783
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:16,061
Got that, dude? Pizza.

784
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:25,863
Frisbee. Also cool. Zam.

785
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:31,243
Who Frisbeed me in the face?

786
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:34,580
- I'm out of here.
- Why, I ought to...

787
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:39,168
It was Mike with the thing for the lady.

788
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:53,932
Whoa, whoa.

789
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,226
Hey, hey, hey, chill. Hey, hey, hey.

790
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:58,395
What is this, The Geraldo Show?

791
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:01,440
You gotta learn
to control that temper, guy.

792
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,442
Did I say that?

793
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:06,320
We're practicing fighting the daimio.

794
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:07,905
Fight the daimio?

795
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:09,281
Hold on here.

796
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:13,369
Fighting's for grown-ups
and that's only if you got no other choice.

797
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:14,703
You guys are kids.

798
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,455
You should be out, um...

799
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:20,125
You should be out having fun,
flying those things.

800
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:22,920
Come on. We can do it together.

801
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:24,296
You could teach me.

802
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,131
Fun is for children.

803
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:28,592
And what, you're a senior citizen?

804
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,261
Come on. It'll be easy.

805
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:33,806
- What did you say your name was?
- Yoshi.

806
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:36,308
Yoshi.

807
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:38,852
Okay. Yoshi.

808
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:43,816
You and your buddies grab those kites
and I'll join you later.

809
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,655
Kids.

810
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:57,454
Yo, Yoshi. Wait up.

811
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,086
Hey, I think I'm getting this.

812
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,588
Yoshi, what do you think? Look at that.

813
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,789
Lord Norinaga accepts your price.

814
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,499
Guns for gold.

815
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:45,294
Tell the daimio to prepare the papers.

816
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:10,736
Oh. Oh, oh, uh...

817
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:14,698
Sorry. I guess you wanna be alone, huh?

818
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:19,495
I was asking the gods
to protect someone.

819
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,246
Kenshin?

820
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:26,543
He's like your beau, huh?

821
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:28,253
You know him?

822
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:34,593
Sort of. He kind of went on a cosmic cruise
and dropped in on us.

823
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:38,305
Oh, but don't worry.
He'll be back as soon as we leave.

824
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:39,723
I promise.

825
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:41,934
How do you know this?

826
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,436
Well...

827
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:47,689
...it's a kappa kind of thing.

828
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:53,779
So...

829
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,405
...what's your sign?

830
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:17,928
Oh, man.

831
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,807
- Hockey.
- Hockey.

832
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:26,979
Guess it's time for a little cultural exchange,
if you know what I mean.

833
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:31,692
Okay, guys.

834
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:33,569
Let's play a little hockey.

835
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,571
Hockey?

836
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:41,994
Take your best shot.

837
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:44,496
Come on.

838
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:47,541
- Just like you saw on TV.
- TV.

839
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:49,167
Remember?

840
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:52,254
- TV.
- TV.

841
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,089
Hey, good.

842
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,675
All right.

843
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:21,950
Okay, I can work with that.
I can work with that.

844
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,701
Good.

845
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:08,914
Tomorrow, Walker,
we will use your guns.

846
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:11,541
My pleasure.

847
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,251
Walker.

848
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,379
Mm?

849
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:19,549
My dungeon is very crowded.

850
01:01:20,968 --> 01:01:24,930
Well, then it would only be humane not to
take any more prisoners, then, wouldn't it?

851
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:27,474
You'll just have to kill everybody.

852
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:33,772
What do you hear, sensei?

853
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:35,774
Danger.

854
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,403
Mitsu.

855
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:47,452
- What is it?
- Mitsu, I bring bad news from the castle.

856
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:49,955
It's two hours to midnight.

857
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:51,206
Oh, I sure hope this works.

858
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:52,916
- Lmpressive.
- Diameter...

859
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:55,377
Yes. Wow, this is perfect.

860
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,421
What if this doesn't work, dudes?

861
01:01:57,588 --> 01:02:01,800
What if we make, like, a cosmic U-turn
and end up back in Godzilla land?

862
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:04,970
We don't have a choice,
unless you wanna stay here.

863
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:07,264
Well, maybe we should.

864
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:08,890
- Hold it.
- Yeah, right.

865
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,101
Forget about Mitsu
and give me the scepter...

866
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:13,437
Hey, Raph, give me back the scepter...

867
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:15,647
- Give it over here.
- Wait.

868
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:17,315
- Hey, hey.
- Aye-ai-ai.

869
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:21,111
- Nice going.
- Butterfingers.

870
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:24,406
What next?

871
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:32,164
The daimio is coming in the morning...

872
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:35,292
...with Walker and guns.

873
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:37,502
Great.

874
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:40,422
- Guns.
- Oh, man.

875
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:50,348
Hey, Yoshi. You awake, buddy?

876
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:56,688
Oh, Yoshi.

877
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:59,941
Hey, hey, hey.
What's the matter, little man?

878
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:01,526
What's up with those tears?

879
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,111
What's going on here?

880
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:04,946
Nothing.

881
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:06,198
Nothing, huh?

882
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:07,449
Well, too bad.

883
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:12,037
Because if something was bothering you,
I got a little present here to cheer you up.

884
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:14,164
It's called a yo-yo.

885
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:16,458
It's yours. I made it for you.

886
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:19,461
I was gonna give it to you tomorrow,
but you know...

887
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:22,047
...things might get a little nuts.
I might forget.

888
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:25,467
You fight daimio in the morning.

889
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:29,262
Yeah. Okay, so tomorrow afternoon...

890
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:31,598
...l'll teach you some tricks
on your yo-yo.

891
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:35,227
- Okay, buddy?
- Tomorrow you might die.

892
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:40,190
Yeah. Okay, Yoshi, you listen to me.

893
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:43,652
Tomorrow morning, you and your buddies
go up into the mountains...

894
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,737
...and you play, you hear me?

895
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:48,365
No matter what happens.

896
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:55,413
I cannot let you die, Raphael-san.

897
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:58,250
Don't worry, kid.

898
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:00,252
Nobody's gonna die.

899
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:04,840
Hey, Yoshi, come on. Where you going?
It's late already.

900
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,092
Get yourself to bed.

901
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:11,054
What are you doing?

902
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:17,435
Yoshi, this isn't playtime.
Your sister's gonna kill me.

903
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:21,273
- What do you got?
- For you, Raphael-san.

904
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:23,358
You didn't have to.

905
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:24,901
I find in the woods.

906
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:27,279
Now you and the other kappa
can go home.

907
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:29,614
Now you no die.

908
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:32,993
Son of a snapper.

909
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:35,453
Leo!

910
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:39,916
I found it!

911
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:43,169
Look at this. It was here the whole time.

912
01:04:43,337 --> 01:04:44,754
- It was under the house.
- Yeah?

913
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:46,381
Her little brother put it there.

914
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:49,551
- Whoa, mondo surprise.
- Whoa.

915
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:51,678
- We're set.
- Let me see.

916
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:53,430
Careful, now. Easy, guys.

917
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,056
- Is it the one?
- That's the one.

918
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:56,850
- Look, it's the scepter.
- Oh, God.

919
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:58,476
- I can't believe it.
- Easy.

920
01:04:58,644 --> 01:05:00,061
So you see...

921
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:06,151
...as long as we didn't have the scepter,
we had no choice but to stay and fight.

922
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,444
Right?

923
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:10,322
You mean, we were set up?

924
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:13,033
- Uncool.
- Hey.

925
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,242
Very uncool.

926
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:16,077
Mitsu.

927
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:18,830
Is that for real?

928
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:27,005
- The vibes in here just turned bad.
- Oh, man.

929
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:28,340
Let's split.

930
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:31,051
Wait. I am the one.

931
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:32,344
Please.

932
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:36,348
I am the one who told my grandson
to hide the scepter.

933
01:05:36,515 --> 01:05:42,187
- What?
- I want you to fight, not Mitsu.

934
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:45,690
- Mitsu!
- Oh, no.

935
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:47,192
- Come on.
- Let's go. Move it.

936
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:58,536
- Evening.
- Mitsu!

937
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:01,039
- Let me at him! I can take hi...!
- Mikey, stay back.

938
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:02,540
Calm down, man.

939
01:06:03,876 --> 01:06:06,544
Give me the scepter,
my little green friends.

940
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,130
No. Kill him.

941
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:11,091
Yeah.

942
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,472
Raph, give me the scepter.

943
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:21,685
Man.

944
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:26,648
Bring Kenshin to the castle tonight...

945
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,733
...you get her back.

946
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:31,736
Come morning, I was you, I'd be gone.

947
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:35,573
Hyah.

948
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:38,743
He's just riding off.

949
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:40,412
Guys, we gotta do something.

950
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:46,126
I apologize for this crude interruption,
daimio...

951
01:06:46,293 --> 01:06:49,587
...but perhaps this little bird
will sing for your supper.

952
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:52,549
Mitsu.

953
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:55,927
Why have you stolen my son?

954
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,889
I do not have your son.

955
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:03,268
He's gone on a magic journey.

956
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,854
Only the scepter can bring him back.

957
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:08,440
You are lying.

958
01:07:08,607 --> 01:07:10,275
You have them both.

959
01:07:12,653 --> 01:07:14,821
I have nothing.

960
01:07:15,781 --> 01:07:17,866
He has the scepter.

961
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,714
Not as chirpy as I'd hoped.

962
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,424
- Niles.
- Come on.

963
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:37,469
- Come on.
- Get out. Out! Get out!

964
01:07:37,636 --> 01:07:40,889
Take her away. Come on. Move it.

965
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:44,642
How did you capture such a woman?

966
01:07:45,352 --> 01:07:47,520
The same way you capture
any wild animal.

967
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:49,898
By setting a trap.

968
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:56,154
I don't have it.

969
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:19,177
Equal partners.

970
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:22,555
Right? I'm not your spy anymore.

971
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:30,396
I wanna see the daimio.

972
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:32,857
Hey, hey, hey. Easy with the hands.

973
01:08:33,025 --> 01:08:36,069
Another little birdie come home to roost.

974
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:40,865
Well, April's inside.

975
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:42,492
Now it's up to us.

976
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:45,870
Is this what they mean
by getting totally vertical?

977
01:08:46,038 --> 01:08:49,666
It's not just a job,
it's an adventure.

978
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,079
Meow, dude.

979
01:09:29,456 --> 01:09:31,499
Ow! His chins landed on my foot.

980
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:34,127
Sayonara, blubber butt.

981
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,212
- Mitsu.
- Yee-ah!

982
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:39,465
How's it hanging, babe?

983
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:40,675
Michaelangelo.

984
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:44,762
Oh, hey, Mit, sorry about the crack
about the bad vibes.

985
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,431
You got great vibes.

986
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:48,683
- Quickly. We must free the others.
- Yeah.

987
01:09:54,648 --> 01:09:56,149
Hey, Whit.

988
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:57,901
Well, well, well, Miss O'Neil.

989
01:09:58,068 --> 01:10:00,778
My partner, Mr. Whit,
and I were just discussing your future.

990
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:03,281
Let me tell you something
about your partner here.

991
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:06,743
He's scum.
He's the lowest scum of the earth.

992
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:08,119
No, you know something?

993
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:09,871
He's lower than scum.

994
01:10:10,247 --> 01:10:12,081
He gives scum a bad name.

995
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:15,043
Of course he does.
That's why I hired him.

996
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:16,628
Take her away.

997
01:10:17,838 --> 01:10:19,756
No, now, wait a minute. Wait.

998
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:22,800
I have information
about the daimio's son.

999
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:25,136
I think she's telling the truth.

1000
01:10:25,429 --> 01:10:27,805
Really?
Well, I don't pay you to think, do I?

1001
01:10:27,973 --> 01:10:31,267
I pay you to lie, cheat and steal.

1002
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:36,522
So why don't you go down to the harbor
and bring back the men and their guns?

1003
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:38,107
Guns?

1004
01:10:38,525 --> 01:10:40,109
Shh. Maybe she's up here.

1005
01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:41,611
Nice and light now.

1006
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:43,655
Ooh. Love the artwork.

1007
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:46,074
Reservations for five?

1008
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,493
Under T, maybe?

1009
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,829
- Come on. Let's go.
- Move it. Move it.

1010
01:10:51,997 --> 01:10:54,332
That's okay, fellas.
We'll find a table ourselves.

1011
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,000
Whoa. Little log there.

1012
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:58,795
Everything looks cool up here.

1013
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:00,088
Come on.

1014
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:02,215
- Come on. Come on.
- Clear on the right.

1015
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:04,217
- Clear on the left.
- Mitsu, you back there?

1016
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:06,010
Yah!

1017
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:12,350
Hey, you guys. Check it out.

1018
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:17,105
- Wow, ancient us.
- Trippy.

1019
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:19,691
The battle of the thousand swords.

1020
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:22,944
Four demons defeated
the daimio and his army.

1021
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:26,281
Definitely family.

1022
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:29,909
Looks like me, but it's got Raph's beak.

1023
01:11:31,328 --> 01:11:33,037
But it was only a legend.

1024
01:11:33,205 --> 01:11:36,374
- Dudes, we're legends.
- Hey, cool.

1025
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:38,459
- I like it.
- Hey, Wayne Newton.

1026
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:42,839
You.

1027
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:47,927
Hey, you were expecting
maybe the Addams family?

1028
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:49,345
Good one.

1029
01:11:49,513 --> 01:11:51,014
You have come back.

1030
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:53,891
We like to drop in
about every three or four centuries.

1031
01:11:54,059 --> 01:11:56,394
Yeah, and it looks like
you're having a rough day.

1032
01:11:56,562 --> 01:12:02,025
So give us the scepter back
and we'll get out of here.

1033
01:12:02,192 --> 01:12:04,027
- Yeah.
- Yeah, huh?

1034
01:12:04,194 --> 01:12:07,739
You have disgraced my ancestor,
but you will not disgrace me.

1035
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:10,158
I'm willing to die.

1036
01:12:13,912 --> 01:12:16,039
We will both die...

1037
01:12:16,206 --> 01:12:18,583
...but only one of us with honor.

1038
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:27,842
Are we out of the loop here or what?

1039
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,344
Yeah.

1040
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:32,555
Hey.

1041
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:34,390
- Mitsu!
- Chill, dude.

1042
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:39,062
- You okay?
- Mikey, watch out.

1043
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:44,609
Oh, he who dings the shell must pay.

1044
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:46,903
- Hyah! Yah!
- Ahhh.

1045
01:12:55,996 --> 01:12:57,789
Yes.

1046
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:08,549
Your turn.

1047
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,804
One, two, three, and kick.

1048
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:15,139
Good night.

1049
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,435
Bases loaded. Home run.

1050
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:21,896
Leapfrog.

1051
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:28,653
Triple play.

1052
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:39,539
Hello. Goodbye.

1053
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:47,672
All right, good job, turtles.

1054
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,133
- Yes!
- Leo, high foot. Hey!

1055
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:52,260
All right. Let's rock 'r roll, dudes.

1056
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,345
Whoa, more logs.

1057
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:57,223
Hey, Mac.

1058
01:13:57,558 --> 01:13:59,016
Take the rest of the day off.

1059
01:13:59,184 --> 01:14:00,852
I'll open the dungeon.

1060
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:03,354
- You guys go that way.
- We must open the gate.

1061
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:05,314
- No problemo.
- Whoa. Scuds.

1062
01:14:05,482 --> 01:14:06,858
Trouble.

1063
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:14,866
One, two, three, four.

1064
01:14:15,033 --> 01:14:17,660
You're free, guys. Let's go.

1065
01:14:41,393 --> 01:14:43,811
I love this stuff!

1066
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:57,366
I get such a kick out of this job.

1067
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,754
Hold it, bucko.

1068
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:37,907
Big mistake, dude.

1069
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:55,299
Go ahead. Finish me.

1070
01:15:56,009 --> 01:15:58,052
Okay.

1071
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:05,643
There. Short enough for you?

1072
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:12,817
Uh?

1073
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:28,541
- Hello?
- Who's trapped inside?

1074
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:30,543
- Lord Norinaga.
- No.

1075
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:32,837
Norinaga?

1076
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:38,009
Name rings a bell.

1077
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:40,845
Good one, guys,

1078
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:43,556
Yes, indeed. Turtles one, daimio zip.

1079
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:44,849
Hey, look.

1080
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:47,643
It's April.

1081
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:52,189
Well, if it ain't the Phantom of the opera.

1082
01:16:52,357 --> 01:16:55,109
Love to stay and chat...

1083
01:16:55,527 --> 01:16:56,944
...but places to go...

1084
01:16:57,112 --> 01:16:58,529
...people to kill.

1085
01:17:04,202 --> 01:17:06,370
Come on, lads.

1086
01:17:07,372 --> 01:17:09,665
Move it. Move it. Out of the way.

1087
01:17:09,833 --> 01:17:12,835
- Oh, no. Guns.
- There goes the neighborhood.

1088
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:14,545
- Wait.
- Hey, calm down.

1089
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:16,213
Thank you, Mr. Whit.

1090
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:18,466
Yeah, Whit. You make a great servant.

1091
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:19,884
I'm real impressed.

1092
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:21,719
- My God.
- Stay cool.

1093
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:23,262
Who's your tailor?

1094
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:24,472
We're naked.

1095
01:17:26,141 --> 01:17:27,308
You okay, April?

1096
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:28,851
- Sorry, guys.
- You all right?

1097
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:32,730
We really don't have time for any
of these social pleasantries, I'm afraid.

1098
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:34,815
- Shoot them.
- Right.

1099
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:39,195
Don't move a finger.

1100
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:45,660
- What did you say?
- I said, shoot them.

1101
01:17:47,287 --> 01:17:49,664
That wasn't part of the deal, Walker.

1102
01:17:51,124 --> 01:17:54,418
Well, if you feel like that,
you'd better join them, then, hadn't you?

1103
01:17:54,586 --> 01:17:56,879
- Niles.
- Right.

1104
01:17:58,924 --> 01:17:59,924
Hey, come on.

1105
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:02,927
- Shoot him too.
- With pleasure.

1106
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:04,762
- Weasel.
- Right, then.

1107
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:07,264
Ready...

1108
01:18:07,724 --> 01:18:10,685
Gee, if we die here in the past...

1109
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:13,979
...does that mean
that we don't get born in the future?

1110
01:18:14,147 --> 01:18:18,609
Hey, Tinkerbell, why don't you shoot us?

1111
01:18:18,777 --> 01:18:21,862
- Leo, wait...
- I'm sorry. Are you addressing me?

1112
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:26,200
Shoot us yourself,
unless you're too scared.

1113
01:18:26,618 --> 01:18:28,119
I get it.

1114
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:32,206
He knows he can't kill us.

1115
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:34,125
We're demons.

1116
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:35,960
They are demons!

1117
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:40,756
Your bullets will just bounce back
and kill all you guys instead.

1118
01:18:40,924 --> 01:18:43,384
Right. What he said, capice?

1119
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:46,971
Would you like the pleasure
of the first shot, captain?

1120
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:49,724
Okay. Go ahead, punk.

1121
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:51,308
Make my day.

1122
01:18:51,476 --> 01:18:54,478
Well, if it's gonna make
you all feel better.

1123
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:00,317
I've got a good idea.

1124
01:19:00,485 --> 01:19:02,653
- What's that, captain?
- Hey, where's he going?

1125
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:04,822
Out. Out of the way.

1126
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:06,699
What's this creep got up his sleeve?

1127
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:08,033
What's he doing?

1128
01:19:08,201 --> 01:19:09,952
Uh-oh. This doesn't bode well.

1129
01:19:11,621 --> 01:19:13,581
Nice bluff, Mr. Leader.

1130
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:16,500
- Major bummer.
- We're toast.

1131
01:19:18,128 --> 01:19:19,670
Try this on for size.

1132
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:23,174
Uh, this could hurt.

1133
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:33,768
Boy, do I love being a turtle.

1134
01:19:34,644 --> 01:19:36,437
Oh, yes. That's very clever.

1135
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:38,397
Oh, yes. Very clever.

1136
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:41,066
Missed me.

1137
01:19:45,405 --> 01:19:47,031
Guess what time it is.

1138
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,992
Willy, willy, willy.

1139
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:54,663
- Take a hike, pal.
- Let's get Walker.

1140
01:19:54,831 --> 01:19:56,165
Hey, guys.

1141
01:20:02,088 --> 01:20:04,048
Oh, look. Don King.

1142
01:20:10,388 --> 01:20:12,473
Smells like a geek ran through here.

1143
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:20,564
My little darlings.
I almost forgot you. Come on.

1144
01:20:25,904 --> 01:20:27,404
- Where'd he go?
- There he goes.

1145
01:20:27,572 --> 01:20:29,490
- Out the window.
- Over there.

1146
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:31,158
- Come on.
- Move out the front.

1147
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:33,202
- Cut him off. Come on.
- Come on, guys.

1148
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:37,915
Hurry, Raph.

1149
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:40,251
Right behind you, Leo.

1150
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:45,589
- He's up there, Donny. Come on.
- All right, let's go.

1151
01:20:45,757 --> 01:20:47,591
This is so good for your calves.

1152
01:20:47,759 --> 01:20:49,051
Yeah.

1153
01:20:58,061 --> 01:21:00,354
Whoa. Stop right there.

1154
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:02,606
Or you're a goner, dude.

1155
01:21:02,774 --> 01:21:03,941
Totally.

1156
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:12,950
What kind of demons are you?

1157
01:21:13,618 --> 01:21:15,286
We're turtles, friend.

1158
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:20,541
Of the teenage mutant ninja variety,
sleazeball.

1159
01:21:20,792 --> 01:21:22,293
Yeah.

1160
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,682
Check it out.

1161
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:41,395
This, I believe,
is what you've been searching for.

1162
01:21:43,815 --> 01:21:46,275
- Go fetch.
- Whoa!

1163
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:49,486
Wait. There goes our ride home.

1164
01:21:49,821 --> 01:21:53,824
Do you really think I'd make it that easy,
you nasty little reptiles?

1165
01:21:55,493 --> 01:21:56,660
I got it. I got it.

1166
01:21:56,828 --> 01:21:58,120
- I call.
- Guys, to the left.

1167
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:03,167
Oh, not again.

1168
01:22:03,627 --> 01:22:05,085
- Mikey, get it.
- I got it.

1169
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:06,837
- It's okay.
- Don't let go.

1170
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:10,341
Mikey. Mike...

1171
01:22:10,508 --> 01:22:12,885
- Nice catch.
- I got you. I got you.

1172
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:15,179
- Donny!
- Whoa, got you.

1173
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:18,307
Yes!

1174
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:19,850
- We got it.
- Oh, yes.

1175
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:40,245
Wow. Bungee jumping without a bungee.

1176
01:22:40,413 --> 01:22:43,040
- That could be dangerous.
- You got that.

1177
01:22:51,257 --> 01:22:53,217
Hey, guys.

1178
01:22:53,885 --> 01:22:55,886
We have an egg timer to catch.

1179
01:22:56,054 --> 01:22:57,888
Let's move it.

1180
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,685
Buckle up, dudes. It's time to go home.

1181
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:05,187
Hey, guys, I'm not going back.

1182
01:23:05,355 --> 01:23:06,605
- What?
- What did you say?

1183
01:23:06,773 --> 01:23:08,774
I said I'm staying here.

1184
01:23:08,942 --> 01:23:10,526
I'm not going back with you.

1185
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:12,820
- Michaelangelo, you can't be serious.
- Jeez.

1186
01:23:14,030 --> 01:23:15,072
He's serious.

1187
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:18,867
Hey. Wait a minute.

1188
01:23:19,035 --> 01:23:21,203
You are going back to New York.

1189
01:23:21,371 --> 01:23:23,706
Been there, done that.

1190
01:23:24,374 --> 01:23:26,917
Michaelangelo, it's our home.

1191
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:29,503
Sure. Your home's a nice apartment.

1192
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:31,588
My home's a sewer.

1193
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:34,383
I've been thinking the same thing, Leo.

1194
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:36,093
People appreciate us here.

1195
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:37,761
We don't have to live like moles.

1196
01:23:37,929 --> 01:23:39,596
Hey, whoa. No way.

1197
01:23:39,764 --> 01:23:41,515
We're all going back.

1198
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:42,766
Tell him, Leo.

1199
01:23:43,101 --> 01:23:46,228
- Actually...
- Hey, not to sound selfish or anything...

1200
01:23:46,396 --> 01:23:48,272
...but what the heck. Why not?

1201
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:52,067
- I do not want to stay here.
- Me neither.

1202
01:23:52,235 --> 01:23:55,821
Do you think I could possibly live
without a single microchip?

1203
01:23:57,490 --> 01:24:00,659
Whoa. Somebody's activated the scepter.

1204
01:24:00,827 --> 01:24:03,162
We gotta go now.

1205
01:24:04,247 --> 01:24:06,457
Kenshin, no.

1206
01:24:06,624 --> 01:24:10,210
We wait 400 years
and this Casey is still late.

1207
01:24:10,378 --> 01:24:12,004
I will wait no longer.

1208
01:24:12,172 --> 01:24:15,883
Kenshin,
you cannot go without the others.

1209
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:18,052
It would be cowardly.

1210
01:24:23,975 --> 01:24:26,810
Come on. Hey, come on. Yeah.

1211
01:24:26,978 --> 01:24:28,312
Both of you. Yeah.

1212
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,147
Come on. Gotta get back.

1213
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:32,149
Time to go.

1214
01:24:34,402 --> 01:24:36,612
Come on, you party animals.

1215
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:37,821
I know. Yeah.

1216
01:24:37,989 --> 01:24:39,656
Okay, come on. Get it together.

1217
01:24:39,824 --> 01:24:44,036
I just wanted to give you guys
a nice peek at the future, all right?

1218
01:24:44,204 --> 01:24:46,872
Bet you guys feel lucky
to be going back, right?

1219
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:49,833
Very lucky. We're going back.

1220
01:24:50,668 --> 01:24:51,960
Not!

1221
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:58,842
This could really screw up history.

1222
01:24:59,010 --> 01:25:00,594
All right. Okay. Enough is enough.

1223
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:02,179
Okay? Let's go.

1224
01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:03,847
Come on.

1225
01:25:04,682 --> 01:25:07,518
- Guys, you cannot split up.
- What?

1226
01:25:07,685 --> 01:25:09,311
You're brothers. Remember?

1227
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:10,979
- Yeah.
- I guess.

1228
01:25:11,147 --> 01:25:13,190
- Yeah.
- Raphael-san.

1229
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:16,360
- Hey, Yoshi.
- Yoshi wants to say goodbye.

1230
01:25:17,362 --> 01:25:19,029
But we're not going back.

1231
01:25:19,197 --> 01:25:21,198
Me and Raph are gonna be staying.

1232
01:25:22,075 --> 01:25:23,283
No.

1233
01:25:25,578 --> 01:25:26,870
Kenshin must return.

1234
01:25:27,288 --> 01:25:29,706
- You promised.
- Well, yeah, but...

1235
01:25:29,874 --> 01:25:33,877
Our two families must be united
or the wars will start again.

1236
01:25:34,045 --> 01:25:35,671
But I thought...

1237
01:25:36,881 --> 01:25:39,967
I wanna stay here with you.

1238
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,803
You will always be here with me...

1239
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:44,513
...Michaelangelo.

1240
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:52,312
Uh-oh. Guys, it's picking up speed.
Come on.

1241
01:25:56,442 --> 01:25:58,902
There was traffic, man.

1242
01:25:59,946 --> 01:26:00,988
Benkei, no.

1243
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:03,323
Hey, wait, wait, wait. No.

1244
01:26:03,491 --> 01:26:06,076
I been thinking.
We have to go back.

1245
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:08,412
It's our destiny.

1246
01:26:08,913 --> 01:26:10,747
I mean, if we stay here...

1247
01:26:10,915 --> 01:26:12,666
...we interfere with their lives.

1248
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:15,210
- And that would be selfish.
- Exactly.

1249
01:26:15,378 --> 01:26:17,212
Our lives are in New York.

1250
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:20,090
- Right, guys?
- Yeah.

1251
01:26:20,925 --> 01:26:22,384
It's Star Trek time, guys.

1252
01:26:22,552 --> 01:26:24,303
- Hey, Yoshi man.
- Yosh.

1253
01:26:24,470 --> 01:26:28,098
- Raphael-san.
- Yo, Yoshi.

1254
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:32,144
I will never forget you, Raphael-san.

1255
01:26:32,937 --> 01:26:38,066
I won't forget you, either, little man.
And remember, watch that temper.

1256
01:26:38,276 --> 01:26:40,944
Hey, all right.

1257
01:26:41,571 --> 01:26:45,115
No, no, no.
I'll put this on layaway for you, okay?

1258
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:46,450
All right?

1259
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:49,411
Giving you an excuse to come back,
Zenmeister.

1260
01:26:49,579 --> 01:26:51,121
Okay?

1261
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:52,706
What?

1262
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:54,124
All right. All right.

1263
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:56,001
Benkei.

1264
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:59,004
You got a bus to catch. Come on.
Go ahead.

1265
01:26:59,172 --> 01:27:01,506
Go ahead. Good.

1266
01:27:04,552 --> 01:27:07,137
It's okay, man. Go ahead.
It'll be all right.

1267
01:27:07,305 --> 01:27:08,972
Benkei.

1268
01:27:11,434 --> 01:27:13,977
- See you later.
- Later.

1269
01:27:14,145 --> 01:27:15,646
Come on, Mikey.

1270
01:27:16,272 --> 01:27:18,315
If you ever get to New York...

1271
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:20,108
Yeah, later, Mikey.

1272
01:27:20,276 --> 01:27:23,320
Okay. Destiny, what a drag. Bye.

1273
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:26,782
Mikey! Hurry!

1274
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:29,451
- I'm coming!
- Come on, Mikey!

1275
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:30,827
Come on!

1276
01:27:33,539 --> 01:27:36,708
Mikey!

1277
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:46,718
Guys, we made it back to the den.

1278
01:27:52,016 --> 01:27:53,684
Michaelangelo?

1279
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,186
Mikey?

1280
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:05,654
- He's got the scepter!
- Get that guy!

1281
01:28:05,822 --> 01:28:07,322
- He's got the scepter!
- No!

1282
01:28:07,490 --> 01:28:08,699
- Get him.
- Grab him.

1283
01:28:08,866 --> 01:28:11,702
Don't let him get up that ladder.

1284
01:28:26,467 --> 01:28:28,885
- Mikey?
- Whoa, gnarly.

1285
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:31,596
Mikey.

1286
01:28:31,764 --> 01:28:36,101
Oh, boy. I can't believe you made it back.
We thought we lost you forever, Mikey.

1287
01:28:36,269 --> 01:28:38,061
- Yeah.
- Thought you were a goner.

1288
01:28:38,229 --> 01:28:39,896
- Glad you're okay.
- Hi, guys.

1289
01:28:40,064 --> 01:28:41,148
You big jerk.

1290
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:42,733
Michaelangelo.

1291
01:29:01,044 --> 01:29:02,669
Father.

1292
01:29:03,421 --> 01:29:05,172
Kenshin.

1293
01:29:33,701 --> 01:29:34,826
Hockey.

1294
01:29:34,994 --> 01:29:36,703
Hockey.

1295
01:29:51,969 --> 01:29:53,678
Kenshin.

1296
01:30:00,686 --> 01:30:01,937
Michaelangelo?

1297
01:30:02,814 --> 01:30:04,314
Yes, Master Splinter?

1298
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:07,984
Something deeply troubles you, my son.

1299
01:30:08,778 --> 01:30:10,612
Growing up.

1300
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:13,281
I don't think I'll ever laugh again.

1301
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:15,492
Hm.

1302
01:30:16,786 --> 01:30:18,829
- Yo, dude.
- Huh?

1303
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:24,501
Yo, dude!

1304
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:27,003
Just like Elvis in Blue Hawaii.

1305
01:30:30,465 --> 01:30:32,000
I saw it on cable.

1306
01:30:34,345 --> 01:30:36,180
- Oh, boy.
- Hey, Mikey.

1307
01:30:36,345 --> 01:30:38,300
Huh?

1308
01:30:38,975 --> 01:30:40,475
Raph?

1309
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:42,145
Donny?

1310
01:30:42,310 --> 01:30:43,980
Leo?

1311
01:30:44,270 --> 01:30:46,355
Gone. Ah!

1312
01:30:47,815 --> 01:30:52,400
Yeah. All right, turtle style. Yeah.

1313
01:30:53,365 --> 01:30:56,000
Get down with your green self.

1314
01:30:57,825 --> 01:31:00,160
Yeah, yeah.

1315
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:01,830
Yeah.

1316
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,580
- Yeah, all right.

1317
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:07,880
Let's get down with our turtle selves!
