1
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:04,018
<i>She looks at me every day.</i>

2
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,978
<i>Mary Jane Watson.</i>

3
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:10,191
<i>Oh, boy. If she only knew
how I felt about her.</i>

4
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:12,151
<i>But she can never know.</i>

5
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,696
<i>I made a choice once to live
a life of responsibility.</i>

6
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,240
<i>A life she can never be a part of.</i>

7
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,700
<i>Who am I?</i>

8
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,453
<i>I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do.</i>

9
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,623
<i>And I'm Peter Parker,
and I, too, have a job.</i>

10
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,375
Parker. Parker!

11
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,752
No, no, no, stop! Stop!

12
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:33,881
Parker, you're late, man. Always late.

13
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:36,967
I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz.
There was a disturbance.

14
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,387
Another disturbance.
Always a disturbance with you.

15
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,390
Come on, 21 minutes ago,
in comes order.

16
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:46,143
Harmattan, Burton & Smith.
Eight extra-large deep-dish pizzas.

17
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,188
In eight minutes, I am defaulting
on Joe's 29-minute guarantee.

18
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:52,316
Then, not only am I receiving
no money for these pizzas...

19
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:55,152
...but I will lose the customer
forever to Pizza Yurt.

20
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,739
Look, you are my only hope, all right?
You have to make it in time.

21
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:02,660
Peter, you're a nice guy.
But you're just not dependable.

22
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,829
This is your last chance.

23
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:09,792
You have to go 42 blocks in 7 1/2
minutes or your ass is fired.

24
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:13,337
Go!

25
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,153
What, are you stupid?

26
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:02,344
He stole that guy's pizzas!

27
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:13,189
I'm gonna get it!

28
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,623
Hey, you guys.
No playing in the streets.

29
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,041
Yes, Mr. Spider-Man.

30
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,001
See you.

31
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,337
Way to go, Spidey!

32
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:30,307
Pizza time.

33
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:37,523
You're late.

34
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:39,817
I'm not paying for those.

35
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:01,922
Joe's 29-minute guarantee
is a promise, man.

36
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,717
I know to you, Parker,
a promise means nothing.

37
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,552
But to me, it's serious.

38
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:08,721
It's serious to me too, Mr. Aziz.

39
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,390
- You're fired. Go.
- Please, I need this job.

40
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:14,059
- You're fired.
- Look, give me another chance.

41
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:24,820
<i>You're fired.</i>

42
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:26,989
- Parker, hello. You're fired.
- Why?

43
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:28,657
Dogs catching Frisbees?

44
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,076
Pigeons in the park?
A couple geezers playing chess?

45
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,536
- Boss.
- Not now.

46
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:35,372
The <i>Bugle</i> could show another
side of New York for a change.

47
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,500
We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah.
We need page one.

48
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:42,046
I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste.
I pay you... Still not now!

49
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,840
I pay you because that psycho
Spider-Man will pose for you.

50
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:46,842
He won't let me take any more pictures.

51
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:50,095
- You turned the whole city against him.
- A fact I'm very proud of.

52
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:54,099
Get your pretty little portfolio off my desk
before I go into a diabetic coma.

53
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,686
- It's your wife, she lost her checkbook.
- Thanks for the good news.

54
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:01,148
Please, isn't there any of these shots
you can use? I need the money.

55
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,360
- Miss Brant? Get me a violin.
- Yes.

56
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,236
Five minutes to deadline, Jonah.

57
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:09,114
Run a picture of a rancid chicken.
Here's the headline:

58
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:11,200
"Food Poisoning Scare Sweeps City."

59
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:13,661
- Some food got poisoned?
- I'm a little nauseous.

60
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,288
All right, Mr. Jameson.

61
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:19,541
It stinks.
Robbie, there's your page one.

62
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,377
"Masked Menace Terrorizes Town."

63
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,087
I told you, he's not a menace.

64
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,880
- I told you...
- I'll take care of it.

65
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:26,590
- I'll give you 150.
- Three hundred.

66
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,300
That's outrageous.

67
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,427
Done. Give this to the girl.

68
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:31,804
Thank you. Bye-bye.

69
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,847
Hi.

70
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,808
Hey, Pete.

71
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:42,272
I don't think this covers the advance
I gave you a couple weeks ago.

72
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:44,525
- Right.
- Sorry.

73
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:46,985
Hey.

74
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,029
Chin up, okay?

75
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,294
Watch it, jerk!

76
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,221
Oh, hey.

77
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,306
Dr. Connors. Sorry.

78
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,016
Where were you headed, Parker?

79
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,476
To your class.

80
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:21,478
My class is over.

81
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,814
See me standing here?

82
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:27,818
I'm sorry. I'm trying. I wanna be here.

83
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,278
Then be here.

84
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,489
Look at you, Peter.

85
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:35,117
Your grades have been steadily declining.

86
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:36,994
You're late for class.

87
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:40,497
You always appear exhausted.

88
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,584
Your paper on fusion is still overdue.

89
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:46,962
I know. I'm planning to write it
on Dr. Otto Octavius.

90
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:50,591
Planning is not a major
at this university.

91
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,512
Octavius is a friend of mine.

92
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:58,056
You better do your research, Parker.

93
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:01,894
Get it done, or I'm failing you.

94
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,958
Surprise!

95
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,045
- Well, say something.
- What's the occasion?

96
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:31,173
- Oh, really, Peter. It's your birthday!
- "What's the occasion?"

97
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:34,760
Whether you want to remember it or not.

98
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:38,222
He lives in another reality.
Don't you, Pete?

99
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,682
- Hi, M.J.
- Hi.

100
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,226
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

101
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:43,560
Long time, no see.

102
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,648
So how's the play?
I read a great review.

103
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,525
It's going fine. It's going good.

104
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:50,943
She's brilliant in it.

105
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,778
Harry sent me roses.

106
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:55,781
So where you been, pal?
You don't return my calls.

107
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,867
I've been busy.

108
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:02,579
Taking pictures of Spider-Man?
How's the bug these days?

109
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,748
The less you see of that man, the better.

110
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:08,335
Now, let's all go into the other room
and have something to eat.

111
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:09,795
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.

112
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:12,089
So how are things going at OSCORP?

113
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:15,133
They're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.

114
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,553
We're about to make
a breakthrough on fusion.

115
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:21,807
How lovely, Harry. Your father
would be so proud, rest his soul.

116
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:23,517
Thank you.

117
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:27,437
We're actually funding one
of your idols, Pete. Otto Octavius.

118
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,065
- I'm writing a paper on him.
- You want to meet him?

119
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:31,483
You'd introduce me?

120
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,862
You bet. Octavius is gonna put
OSCORP on the map...

121
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,072
...in a way my father
never even dreamed of.

122
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,658
M.J., could you give me a hand?

123
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,620
She's waiting for you, pal.

124
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,080
What do you mean?

125
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:47,708
The way she looks at you
or doesn't look at you.

126
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,543
However you want to look at it.

127
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,129
I don't have time for girls right now.

128
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:53,630
Why, are you dead?

129
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,424
I've been kind of busy.

130
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:57,634
Taking pictures of your friend?

131
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:00,137
Could we get off that subject?

132
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,557
I want us to be friends, Harry.
I want us to trust each other.

133
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,475
Then be honest with me.

134
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:08,687
If you knew who he was,
would you tell me?

135
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,503
May.

136
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,797
Oh, what, Ben?

137
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,050
Wait.

138
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,052
- Aunt May.
- Oh, my.

139
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:45,766
Oh, Peter. Oh, for a second there,
I thought I was years ago.

140
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,853
Everybody's gone, aren't they?

141
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:51,939
Did they have a good time?

142
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,441
I'm sure they did.

143
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:59,863
- You okay?
- Of course. But you go home.

144
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,698
And be careful.

145
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:05,202
I don't like that scooter
thing you drive around.

146
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,120
I'm worried about you.

147
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:12,584
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.

148
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:15,212
Oh, my. You did?

149
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,047
Oh, well.

150
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:18,632
So?

151
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:20,801
I'm a little behind.

152
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,887
Everybody is.

153
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:27,224
Anyway, I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

154
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:31,186
I'm tired, and you better
start back home.

155
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,399
Here, kiddo. Happy birthday.

156
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,401
You need it more than I do.

157
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,112
- No, I can't take that from you.
- Yes, you can!

158
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,322
You can take this money from me.

159
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,242
For God's sake, it's not much.
Now take it!

160
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:47,869
And don't you dare leave it here.

161
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,204
Oh, I'm sorry.

162
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:55,127
It's just that I miss your
uncle Ben so much.

163
00:13:56,837 --> 00:14:02,009
Can you believe that it's two years
next month since he was taken?

164
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:06,763
I think to myself at times...

165
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:12,185
...were I to face the one responsible
for what happened, I'd...

166
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,272
Oh, I don't know what I'd do.

167
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,946
Now...

168
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:27,826
...you better take the rest
of your cake home.

169
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,842
Hey.

170
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:46,136
Hey. You're still here.

171
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,889
I saw your billboard on Bleecker.

172
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:52,392
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.

173
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,688
Don't be. It's nice.
I get to see you every day now.

174
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,735
I liked seeing you tonight, Peter.

175
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,739
Oh, boy, yeah.

176
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:09,284
"Oh, boy, yeah" what?

177
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:15,457
Nothing.

178
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:22,130
Do you want to say something?

179
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,262
I...

180
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:36,770
...was...

181
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:41,108
...wondering if you're still in the Village.

182
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:52,119
You're such a mystery.

183
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,964
Peter.

184
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:06,883
What?

185
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:14,057
Happy birthday.

186
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,651
I'm seeing somebody now.

187
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,445
You mean, like a boyfriend?

188
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,240
Well, like I like him.

189
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,828
What?

190
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,247
Nothing.

191
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:41,960
That's good, you know? Companionship...

192
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:44,671
May be more than that.

193
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,299
More?

194
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:49,509
I don't know.

195
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:53,054
I'm coming to see your
play tomorrow night.

196
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:59,519
- You're coming?
- I'll be there.

197
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,314
Don't disappoint me.

198
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,900
I won't.

199
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:20,624
Rent.

200
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:27,130
- Hi.
- Hi. What's "hi"?

201
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,216
Can I spend it?

202
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,468
I have a paycheck due this week and...

203
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:34,971
- You're a month late again. Again.
- I promise as soon as...

204
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:38,600
If promises were crackers,
my daughter would be fat.

205
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:43,688
I'm really sorry, Mr. Ditkovitch.
All I got is this 20 for the rest of the week.

206
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:45,982
"Sorry" doesn't pay the rent.

207
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:47,651
And don't try to sneak past me.

208
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:51,613
I have ears like a cat
and eyes like a rodent.

209
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:55,533
- Thanks, Mr. Ditkovitch.
- Hi, Pete.

210
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:43,957
Hello?

211
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,049
Rent?

212
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,515
Doctor? Mr. Osborn's here.

213
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:04,769
Nobel Prize, Otto. Nobel Prize.
And we'll all be rich.

214
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:06,521
It's not about the prizes, Harry.

215
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:08,481
But you need money.
You need OSCORP.

216
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:09,858
Who do we have here?

217
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:11,776
This is my good friend
I called you about.

218
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:13,695
He got me through high-school science.

219
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:16,865
Peter Parker, sir.
I'm writing a paper on you for...

220
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:18,450
I know what you're doing here...

221
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,869
...but I don't have time
to talk to students now.

222
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,705
But OSCORP pays the bills, so...

223
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:26,207
That's why I have to take off.
Board meeting.

224
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:29,753
But my job is done here.
Got you two geniuses together.

225
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,466
Good luck tomorrow, Otto.
Nobel Prize. We'll see you in Sweden!

226
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,678
Interesting fellow, your friend.

227
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,056
- I won't take much of your time.
- Parker.

228
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:44,017
Now I remember you.
You're Connors' student.

229
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:45,518
Tells me you're brilliant.

230
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,438
He also tells me you're lazy.

231
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,690
I'm trying to do better.

232
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:54,611
Being brilliant's not enough, young man.
You have to work hard.

233
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:58,031
Intelligence is not a privilege, it's a gift.

234
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,283
And you use it for the good of mankind.

235
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,077
You want to try it back there?

236
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:04,287
So is that it?

237
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:08,958
Yes. My design to initiate
and sustain fusion.

238
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:12,170
I understand you use harmonics
of atomic frequencies.

239
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:13,797
Sympathetic frequencies.

240
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,091
Harmonic reinforcement?

241
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,967
Go on.

242
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:22,097
An exponential increase in energy output.

243
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,932
A huge amount of energy.

244
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:28,978
Like a perpetual sun providing
renewable power for the whole world.

245
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,648
Are you sure you could
stabilize the fusion reaction?

246
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:35,235
Peter, what have we been talking
about for the last hour and a half?

247
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,821
This is my life's work.

248
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:41,157
I certainly know the consequences
of the slightest miscalculation.

249
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:43,618
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to question you.

250
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:47,122
Rosie, our new friend thinks
I'm gonna blow up the city.

251
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,165
You can sleep soundly tonight.

252
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:51,042
Otto's done his homework.

253
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:54,629
Come to the demonstration tomorrow
and you'll see for yourself.

254
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:57,006
And you need to sleep
soundly tonight, Otto.

255
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,259
Did Edison sleep before
he turned on the light?

256
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:02,137
Did Marconi sleep before
he turned on the radio?

257
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,431
Did Beethoven sleep before
he wrote the <i>5th</i>?

258
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,934
Did Bernoulli sleep before he found
the curves of quickest descent?

259
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,562
Rosie, I love this boy.

260
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:14,941
Peter, tell us about yourself.
Do you have a girlfriend?

261
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,152
Well...

262
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:19,654
I don't really know.

263
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:22,949
Well, shouldn't you know?
I mean, who would know?

264
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:26,119
Leave him alone.
Maybe it's a secret love.

265
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:28,246
Love should never be a secret.

266
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:31,624
If you keep something as complicated
as love stored up inside...

267
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,335
...gonna make you sick.

268
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,504
I finally got lucky in love.

269
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:37,922
We both did.

270
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:41,801
But it's hardly perfect.
You have to work at it.

271
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:45,680
I met him on the college steps,
and I knew it wasn't going to be easy.

272
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:49,100
He was studying science,
and I was studying English literature.

273
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:52,437
That's right. I was trying
to explain the theory of relativity.

274
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:55,106
And Rosie was trying
to explain T.S. Eliot.

275
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:58,359
I still don't understand
what he was talking about.

276
00:21:58,526 --> 00:21:59,777
- Yes, you do.
- I'm serious.

277
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:03,865
T.S. Eliot is more complicated
than advanced science.

278
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:08,036
But if you want to get a woman to fall
in love with you, feed her poetry.

279
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:09,621
Poetry.

280
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,415
Never fails.

281
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:19,797
<i>A tall and slender maiden
All alone upon a prairie</i>

282
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:22,342
<i>Brightest green were all her garments</i>

283
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:25,094
<i>And her hair was like the sunshine</i>

284
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:28,139
<i>Day by day he gazed upon her</i>

285
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,823
Rent!

286
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,702
Where is my money?!

287
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,354
You seem jittery tonight.

288
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,273
You never know who's coming.

289
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:18,958
Ladies, five minutes. Five minutes.

290
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,143
How'd you do that?

291
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,565
Work out, plenty of rest.

292
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:44,484
You know, eat your green vegetables.

293
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:48,905
That's what my mom is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.

294
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:53,076
Come on. Go.

295
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,664
Keep it steady.

296
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,646
It's a web.

297
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:24,273
Go, Spidey, go!

298
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,616
We got trouble!

299
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,846
Get me down!

300
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:57,807
I am more than content with
what Mr. Moncrieff said.

301
00:25:57,974 --> 00:26:01,227
His voice alone inspires one
with absolute credulity.

302
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:03,896
Then you think we should forgive them?

303
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,067
Yes.

304
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:10,570
I mean, no.

305
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:19,120
Hey. Hey. Hey, chief.
You park there, I'm towing it.

306
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:20,955
Whatever.

307
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,834
Shoelace.

308
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,382
You might want to...

309
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:40,516
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I've come to see the show.

310
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:44,562
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. No one will be
seated after the doors are closed.

311
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:47,982
It helps maintain the illusion.

312
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:52,779
Miss Watson, she's a friend of mine.
She asked me to come.

313
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,864
But not to come late.

314
00:26:56,908 --> 00:27:00,369
I have to see this show.
Just let me in, I'll stand in the...

Hey. You sure you don't
wanna come tonight?

321
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:48,709
- Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah.
- Yeah?

322
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:50,545
- Okay. Call me.
- I will.

323
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:52,380
- You were great tonight.
- Thanks.

324
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:57,510
May I have an autograph please, miss?

325
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:00,763
What are you doing here?

326
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:16,487
You hungry?

327
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:18,489
Starved.

328
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:09,540
What was that?

329
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:16,672
Okay.

330
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:58,381
Cool Spidey outfit.

331
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:01,300
Thanks.

332
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:04,595
Where'd you get it?

333
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,515
I made it.

334
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,895
Looks uncomfortable.

335
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:16,440
Yeah, it gets kind of itchy.

336
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:22,613
And it rides up in the crotch
a little bit too.

337
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:16,584
<i>Hi. It's me. Sing your song at the beep.</i>

338
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:18,377
Hi, M.J.

339
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,254
This is Peter.

340
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:23,758
<i>I was on my way to your show and...</i>

341
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:28,220
<i>Well, I was on my bike...</i>

342
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:32,725
<i>Are you there?</i>

343
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:38,564
I really was planning on it all day.

344
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:41,192
And...

345
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:44,779
...I know you predicted
I'd disappoint you.

346
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:46,781
Bingo.

347
00:31:47,782 --> 00:31:49,950
<i>It's amazing, isn't it?</i>

348
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:53,412
<i>How complicated a simple thing...</i>

349
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:58,918
<i>...like being someplace
at 8:00 can become.</i>

350
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:06,801
<i>Actually, there was this obnoxious usher.</i>

351
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:10,096
Somebody has to talk to that usher, M.J.

352
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,806
<i>Your time has expired.</i>

353
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:16,268
<i>Please deposit 50 cents
for the next five minutes.</i>

354
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:28,489
I wanna tell you the truth.

355
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,992
Here it is.

356
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,870
I'm Spider-Man.

357
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:37,331
Weird, huh?

358
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:41,377
Now you know why I can't be with you.

359
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:47,383
If my enemies found out about you...

360
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:53,347
...if you got hurt, I could
never forgive myself.

361
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:02,273
I wish I could tell you
how I feel about you.

362
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:14,535
Ladies and gentlemen...

363
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:18,581
...my wife Rosie and I would like
to welcome you this afternoon.

364
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,332
But first, before we start...

365
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:25,129
...has anybody lost a large roll
of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band?

366
00:33:25,296 --> 00:33:26,797
Because we found the rubber band.

367
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:32,928
It's a terrible joke.

368
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:34,972
But thank you for coming.

369
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:36,390
Today...

370
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:41,187
...you will witness the birth of a new
fusion-based energy source.

371
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:44,273
Safe, renewable energy...

372
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,609
...and cheap electricity for everyone.

373
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:51,447
And now let me introduce my assistants.

374
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:01,790
These four actuators were
developed and programmed...

375
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:05,461
...for the sole purpose
of creating successful fusion.

376
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:08,214
They are impervious
to heat and magnetism.

377
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:58,138
These smart arms are controlled
by my brain through a neural link.

378
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:01,058
Nanowires feed directly
into my cerebellum...

379
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:05,354
...allowing me to use these arms
to control fusion reaction...

380
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:08,357
...in an environment
no human hand could enter.

381
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:10,943
Doctor, if the artificial
intelligence in the arms...

382
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,903
...is as advanced as you suggest...

383
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,114
...couldn't that make you
vulnerable to them?

384
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:16,532
How right you are.

385
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:18,826
Which is why I developed
this inhibitor chip...

386
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:21,328
...to protect my higher brain function.

387
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:25,874
It means I maintain control of these arms,
instead of them controlling me.

388
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,585
And now on to the main event.

389
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,963
Give me the blue light, Rosie.

390
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:54,111
Precious tritium is the fuel
that makes this project go.

391
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:57,406
There's only 25 pounds
of it on the whole planet.

392
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:02,369
I'd like to thank Harry Osborn and
OSCORP Industries for providing it.

393
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:04,246
Happy to pay the bills, Otto.

394
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:19,595
Ladies and gentlemen...

395
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:24,183
...fasten your seat belts.

396
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,371
Doctor, we have a successful fusion reaction.

397
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:53,545
This is a breakthrough beyond
your father's dreams.

398
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:54,797
Thank you.

399
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:57,007
We're producing a thousand-megawatt surplus.

400
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:07,017
The power of the sun...

401
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:10,020
...in the palm of my hand.

402
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:33,502
Keep calm! It's only a spike!

403
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:35,838
It'll soon stabilize!

404
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:42,302
- Pete.
- Ladies and gentlemen...

405
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:44,138
...please clear the room.

406
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,103
We have a containment breach!

407
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:55,941
Otto, please get back!

408
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,778
Shut it off, Otto! Shut it off!

409
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,823
It will stabilize! It's under control!

410
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,867
I'm in charge here!

411
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:08,620
It's my money! I'm in con...

412
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:13,709
This doesn't change anything.

413
00:38:16,837 --> 00:38:19,173
- What are you doing?
- Pulling the plug.

414
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,799
No!

415
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,361
Rosie!

416
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:14,603
- Watch it.
- That was too close.

417
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:18,982
If he had more than a drop of tritium,
he could have destroyed the city.

418
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,156
I'm ruined.

419
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:29,826
I have nothing left, except Spider-Man.

420
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,954
He saved your life, sir.

421
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,498
He humiliated me by touching me.

422
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:37,292
The press will be here soon.
I suggest we move on.

423
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:39,836
What was he doing here anyway?

424
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:42,005
Heading around the back.

425
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:58,146
Molten metal penetrated
the spinal cavity...

426
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,482
...and fused the vertebrae at multiple points...

427
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:03,235
...including the lamina and
the roof of the spinal column.

428
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:05,571
We won't know the extent
of the damage until we get in there.

429
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:08,699
I suggest we cut off these mechanical
arms, slice up the harness...

430
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:11,243
...and, if need be, consider a laminectomy...

431
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,788
...with posterior spinal fusion
from C7-T1 to T12.

432
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:16,248
We're ready, doctor.

433
00:40:19,543 --> 00:40:21,378
Anybody here take shop class?

434
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,419
No! No! No!

435
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:06,465
Help me! Help me!

436
00:42:17,536 --> 00:42:22,416
No!

437
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:15,469
It's all over town, Robbie.
Gossip. Rumors.

438
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:17,679
Panic in the streets, if we're lucky.

439
00:43:17,846 --> 00:43:20,682
Crazy scientist turns himself
into some kind of a monster.

440
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:24,019
Four mechanical arms welded
right onto his body.

441
00:43:24,478 --> 00:43:29,065
Guy named Otto Octavius winds up
with eight limbs. What are the odds?

442
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,234
- Hoffman!
- Yeah?

443
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:33,862
What are we gonna call this guy?

444
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:36,281
- "Dr. Octopus."
- That's crap.

445
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:37,949
- "Science Squid"?
- Crap!

446
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:40,202
- "Dr. Strange."
- That's pretty good.

447
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:45,123
But it's taken.
Wait, wait! I got it. "Dr. Octopus."

448
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,751
- But... I like it.
- Of course you do.

449
00:43:47,918 --> 00:43:51,713
Dr. Octopus.
New villain in town. "Doc Ock."

450
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,840
- Genius.
- What, are you looking for a raise?

451
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:55,675
Get out.

452
00:43:56,343 --> 00:43:57,636
Chief, I found Parker.

453
00:43:57,803 --> 00:44:00,013
Where you been?
Why don't you pay your phone bill?

454
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,516
Mad scientist goes berserk,
we don't have pictures!

455
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:03,934
I heard Spider-Man was there.

456
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:07,729
Where were you?
Photographing squirrels? You're fired.

457
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:09,231
Chief, the planetarium party.

458
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:11,274
You're un-fired.
I need you, come here.

459
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:13,693
What do you know about high society?

460
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,237
- Well, I...
- Don't answer that.

461
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:18,865
My society photographer got hit in the head
by a polo ball. You're all I got.

462
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:21,993
Big party for an American hero.
My son, the astronaut.

463
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,912
Could you pay me in advance?

464
00:44:32,963 --> 00:44:35,465
You serious? Pay you for what?
Standing there?

465
00:44:35,632 --> 00:44:38,927
The planetarium, tomorrow night, 8:00.
There's the door.

466
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:55,610
My Rosie's dead.

467
00:44:57,237 --> 00:44:59,447
My dream is dead.

468
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:04,411
And these...

469
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:09,916
...monstrous things should be
at the bottom of the river...

470
00:45:12,294 --> 00:45:14,421
...along with me.

471
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,306
Something...

472
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:27,809
...in my head.

473
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:33,189
Something talking.

474
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,528
The inhibitor chip!

475
00:45:41,448 --> 00:45:43,074
Gone.

476
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:49,539
Rebuild.

477
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:54,127
No.

478
00:45:55,337 --> 00:45:57,255
Peter was right.

479
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,426
I miscalculated.

480
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:09,809
I couldn't have miscalculated.

481
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:12,938
It was working, wasn't it?

482
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:19,319
Yes.

483
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:22,739
We could rebuild.
Enlarge the containment field.

484
00:46:22,906 --> 00:46:25,408
Make it bigger and stronger than ever.

485
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:28,244
But we need money.

486
00:46:29,663 --> 00:46:30,997
Steal it?

487
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:32,916
No, no, no, I'm not a criminal.

488
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:37,337
That's right.

489
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:42,550
The real crime would be not
to finish what we started.

490
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,681
We'll do it here.

491
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:51,518
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.

492
00:46:51,685 --> 00:46:54,187
Nothing will stand in our way.

493
00:46:54,354 --> 00:46:55,981
Nothing!

494
00:47:01,111 --> 00:47:03,780
- That's the social security.
- Yes, I see.

495
00:47:03,947 --> 00:47:05,699
My uncle Ben's life insurance.

496
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:08,159
Yes, but I'm afraid...

497
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:11,538
...it's just not sufficient
to refinance your home.

498
00:47:11,705 --> 00:47:15,250
Oh, but I'm giving piano lessons again.

499
00:47:15,417 --> 00:47:16,668
You are?

500
00:47:21,673 --> 00:47:25,051
We appreciate that you've
just opened up...

501
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:27,804
...a new supersaver
account with us today.

502
00:47:27,971 --> 00:47:29,264
But the fact is...

503
00:47:29,431 --> 00:47:34,227
...you do not have the assets
to justify this loan. I'm sorry.

504
00:47:34,394 --> 00:47:35,937
Well...

505
00:47:37,731 --> 00:47:39,566
At least we get the toaster.

506
00:47:39,733 --> 00:47:44,029
Actually, that's only with
a deposit of 300 or more.

507
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:47,866
Oh, yes, I see.

508
00:47:49,409 --> 00:47:51,036
Okay.

509
00:47:54,122 --> 00:47:56,583
Don't worry, we'll figure it out.

510
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:15,310
Peter?

511
00:48:16,686 --> 00:48:17,729
Don't leave me.

512
00:48:19,439 --> 00:48:22,192
Oh, that boy of yours is a real hero.

513
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:23,985
Hold it!

514
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,030
Put your arms up! All of them!

515
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:51,679
Here's your change!

516
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:03,108
Oh, no. Come on!

517
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:18,790
- You're getting on my nerves.
- I have a knack for that.

518
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:20,500
Not anymore.

519
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,490
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Freeze!

520
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,787
- Hold your fire!
- Don't follow me.

521
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:02,876
Wait a second.

522
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:05,670
That won't be charged to my card
for seven days, right?

523
00:50:05,837 --> 00:50:07,672
Thank you so much.

524
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:23,479
- Hand her over.
- Of course.

525
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,107
Easy, now.

526
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:28,234
Butterfingers.

527
00:50:41,164 --> 00:50:42,457
Look out!

528
00:50:44,626 --> 00:50:45,668
Help me!

529
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:50,256
- Help me!
- I'm coming!

530
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:57,680
Hang on!

531
00:51:16,241 --> 00:51:17,617
Help. Help.

532
00:51:37,512 --> 00:51:39,389
Thank you.

533
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:43,685
Aunt May.

534
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:46,854
You've stuck your webs
in my business for the last time.

535
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:50,066
Now you'll have this woman's
death on your conscience.

536
00:51:55,655 --> 00:51:57,240
Come on.

537
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:03,371
Shame on you.

538
00:52:35,695 --> 00:52:37,488
There you go.

539
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:41,743
Thank you.
Oh, have I been wrong about you.

540
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:43,077
We sure showed him.

541
00:52:43,244 --> 00:52:44,996
What do you mean, "we"?

542
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:51,544
- Take me with you, Spider-Man.
- No, take me!

543
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:22,158
- May I? All right.
- Sure. Go ahead.

544
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,869
Penny! Over here!

545
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:31,501
Leave it.

546
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:37,882
Hey. Might wanna take it easy, buddy.

547
00:53:38,049 --> 00:53:39,550
Why? It's a party.

548
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:42,637
Wouldn't you be drinking if you
lost a bundle on some crackpot...

549
00:53:42,804 --> 00:53:46,391
...who you thought was gonna take
you with him to fame and fortune?

550
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:48,184
Not to mention your friend the bug.

551
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:50,019
Not tonight, Harry.

552
00:53:50,186 --> 00:53:53,689
Every night. Until I find him, it's 24/7.

553
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:55,608
Parker!

554
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:57,944
Parker!

555
00:53:58,111 --> 00:54:01,114
Parker! What, are you deaf?
I called you twice.

556
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,324
Think I'm paying you to sip champagne?

557
00:54:03,491 --> 00:54:05,368
Get a shot of my wife with the minister.

558
00:54:05,827 --> 00:54:07,120
Beautiful tie.

559
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:09,747
No, get a shot of us with the DA.

560
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:11,666
Beautiful dress.

561
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:14,752
Here, get a shot of the mayor
and his girlfriend.

562
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,505
Wife.

563
00:54:19,507 --> 00:54:21,801
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

564
00:54:21,968 --> 00:54:25,012
The committee for the Science
Library of New York...

565
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:27,432
...is pleased to present
our guest of honor.

566
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:31,561
He's the first man to play
football on the moon.

567
00:54:32,437 --> 00:54:35,606
The handsome, the heroic,
the delicious...

568
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:38,401
...Captain John Jameson.

569
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,863
Hi.

570
00:55:26,324 --> 00:55:29,660
- You.
- Listen, I'm sorry.

571
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:31,954
But there was a disturbance.

572
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:33,706
I don't know you.

573
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:39,253
And I can't keep thinking about you.
It's too painful.

574
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:41,881
I've been reading poetry lately.

575
00:55:42,048 --> 00:55:43,382
Whatever that means.

576
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:47,386
<i>Day by day he gazed upon her</i>

577
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:50,681
<i>Day by day he sighed with passion
Day by day...</i>

578
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:52,058
Don't start.

579
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:55,978
Can I get you a drink?

580
00:55:56,145 --> 00:55:57,855
I'm with John. He'll get me my drink.

581
00:55:58,564 --> 00:56:00,191
John.

582
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:04,278
By the way, John has seen
my show five times.

583
00:56:04,445 --> 00:56:07,406
Harry has seen it twice.
Aunt May has seen it.

584
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:10,076
My sick mother got out of bed to see it.

585
00:56:10,243 --> 00:56:11,410
Even my father.

586
00:56:12,537 --> 00:56:15,706
He came backstage to borrow cash.

587
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:21,420
But my best friend,
who cares so much about me...

588
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:24,215
...can't make an 8:00 curtain.

589
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:26,968
After all these years...

590
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:31,347
...he's nothing to me but an empty seat.

591
00:56:56,414 --> 00:56:59,875
It pisses me off, your loyalty to Spider-Man
and not to your best friend.

592
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:03,212
I find him with my father's body
and you defend him.

593
00:57:03,379 --> 00:57:05,464
- Take it easy.
- Don't push me.

594
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:07,383
Don't act like you're my friend.

595
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:10,386
You stole M.J. from me.

596
00:57:10,553 --> 00:57:12,763
You stole my father's love.

597
00:57:13,139 --> 00:57:18,102
Then you let him die because you didn't
turn in the freak. Isn't that right?

598
00:57:20,396 --> 00:57:22,732
Isn't that right? Huh, brother?

599
00:57:34,535 --> 00:57:37,246
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just want you all to know...

600
00:57:37,997 --> 00:57:42,752
...that the beautiful Miss Mary Jane Watson
has just agreed to marry me.

601
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:54,513
What a surprise.

602
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,516
Parker, wake up! Wake up!
Shoot the picture!

603
00:58:24,585 --> 00:58:26,921
Oh, no. No!

604
00:58:37,932 --> 00:58:40,518
Why is this happening to me?

605
01:00:07,438 --> 01:00:09,732
You seem very okay to me.

606
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:11,484
My diagnosis?

607
01:00:11,984 --> 01:00:13,444
It's up here.

608
01:00:16,155 --> 01:00:20,367
You say you can't sleep.
Heartbreak? Bad dreams?

609
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:24,371
There is one dream where...

610
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:26,415
...in my dream...

611
01:00:27,166 --> 01:00:28,501
...I'm Spider-Man.

612
01:00:28,918 --> 01:00:33,506
But I'm losing my powers.
I'm climbing a wall, but I keep falling.

613
01:00:37,092 --> 01:00:38,719
So you're Spider-Man.

614
01:00:38,886 --> 01:00:40,095
In my dream.

615
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:44,642
Actually, it's not even my dream.
It's a friend of mine's dream.

616
01:00:46,811 --> 01:00:49,021
Somebody else's dream.

617
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:55,528
What about this friend?

618
01:00:56,403 --> 01:01:00,074
Why does he climb these walls?
What does he think of himself?

619
01:01:00,241 --> 01:01:04,620
That's the problem.
He doesn't know what to think.

620
01:01:04,787 --> 01:01:08,582
Gotta make you mad not to know
who you are. Your soul disappears.

621
01:01:08,749 --> 01:01:10,835
Nothing as bad as uncertainty.

622
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:12,878
Listen...

623
01:01:13,754 --> 01:01:18,092
...maybe you're not supposed to be
Spider-Man climbing those walls.

624
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:20,719
That's why you keep falling.

625
01:01:22,638 --> 01:01:25,057
You always have a choice, Peter.

626
01:01:26,809 --> 01:01:29,061
I have a choice.

627
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:40,990
<i>All the things you've been
thinking about, Peter...</i>

628
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:43,242
<i>...make me sad.</i>

629
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:47,204
Can't you understand?

630
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:49,999
I'm in love with Mary Jane.

631
01:01:50,416 --> 01:01:53,502
Peter, all the times we've talked of honesty...

632
01:01:54,128 --> 01:01:56,755
...fairness, justice...

633
01:01:57,506 --> 01:02:02,303
Out of those times, I counted
on you to have the courage...

634
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:06,807
...to take those dreams out into the world.

635
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:10,394
I can't live your dreams anymore.

636
01:02:11,186 --> 01:02:13,022
I want a life of my own.

637
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:15,316
You've been given a gift, Peter.

638
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:19,904
With great power comes
great responsibility.

639
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:26,452
Take my hand, son.

640
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:41,467
No, Uncle Ben.

641
01:02:43,177 --> 01:02:45,804
I'm just Peter Parker.

642
01:02:47,181 --> 01:02:49,350
I'm Spider-Man...

643
01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:51,352
...no more.

644
01:02:52,478 --> 01:02:54,355
No more.

645
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:03,989
No more.

646
01:04:30,242 --> 01:04:32,202
Hey!

647
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:34,872
- You punk!
- Sorry.

648
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:37,791
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

649
01:04:44,757 --> 01:04:46,508
Hurry up!

650
01:04:55,893 --> 01:04:59,354
And when the borderline is tau
equals zero, the eigenvalues are...?

651
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:01,482
Someone, please?

652
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:06,320
.23 electron volts.

653
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:14,453
Excellent work today, Parker.
Keep it up.

654
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:27,549
I'm not really wicked at all.
You mustn't think that I'm wicked.

655
01:05:27,716 --> 01:05:30,344
If you are not, then you have
certainly been deceiving us all...

656
01:05:30,511 --> 01:05:32,596
...in a very inexcusable manner.

657
01:05:32,763 --> 01:05:34,932
I hope you have not been
leading a double life...

658
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:38,310
...pretending to be wicked and
being really good all the time.

659
01:05:38,477 --> 01:05:40,771
That would be hypocrisy.

660
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:43,690
Of course, I have been rather reckless.

661
01:05:44,775 --> 01:05:46,235
<i>Hey.</i>

662
01:05:49,488 --> 01:05:50,989
"I am glad."

663
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:53,784
"I am glad."

664
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:55,869
"I am glad."

665
01:05:57,746 --> 01:06:00,332
Are you glad to hear it?

666
01:06:02,084 --> 01:06:04,419
I am glad...

667
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:06,046
...to hear it.

668
01:06:06,213 --> 01:06:07,965
In fact, now you mention the subject...

669
01:06:08,132 --> 01:06:12,136
...I have been very bad
in my own small way.

670
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:16,640
You were so wonderful.
That was such a great play.

671
01:06:16,807 --> 01:06:18,851
You could've told me you were coming.

672
01:06:19,017 --> 01:06:21,895
I was afraid you'd say, "Don't come."

673
01:06:25,065 --> 01:06:27,276
You look different.

674
01:06:27,442 --> 01:06:32,531
I shined my shoes, pressed
my pants, did my homework.

675
01:06:32,698 --> 01:06:34,908
I do my homework now.

676
01:06:36,577 --> 01:06:38,412
You wanna get some chow mein?

677
01:06:38,579 --> 01:06:39,997
Peter...

678
01:06:40,414 --> 01:06:42,040
...I'm getting married.

679
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,840
I always imagined you getting
married on a hilltop.

680
01:06:50,007 --> 01:06:51,884
And who's the groom?

681
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:54,386
You hadn't decided yet.

682
01:06:56,263 --> 01:06:58,390
You think just because you saw my play...

683
01:06:58,557 --> 01:07:01,059
...you can talk me out of getting married?

684
01:07:01,226 --> 01:07:04,438
You once told me you loved me.
I let things get in the way before.

685
01:07:04,605 --> 01:07:08,442
There was something I thought
I had to do. I don't have to.

686
01:07:08,609 --> 01:07:10,736
You're too late.

687
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:12,613
Will you think about it?

688
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:14,114
Think about what?

689
01:07:14,281 --> 01:07:16,283
Picking up where we left off.

690
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:17,784
Where was that?

691
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:20,454
We never got on.
You can't get off if you don't get on.

692
01:07:20,621 --> 01:07:21,997
I don't think it's that simple.

693
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:24,458
Of course you don't,
because you complicate things.

694
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:26,585
You don't understand.

695
01:07:26,752 --> 01:07:29,588
I'm not an empty seat anymore.

696
01:07:29,755 --> 01:07:31,173
I'm different.

697
01:07:31,757 --> 01:07:34,301
Punch me, I bleed.

698
01:07:41,016 --> 01:07:42,851
I have to go.

699
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:52,361
I'm getting married in a church.

700
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:01,161
You are different.

701
01:08:15,968 --> 01:08:19,263
Dear, we agreed to put on a wedding,
not go into bankruptcy.

702
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:22,766
Caviar? What, are we inviting the tsar?

703
01:08:22,933 --> 01:08:25,602
Get some cheese and crackers,
some of those cocktail weenies.

704
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:29,022
I got a garbage man, says he's got
something you might want to see.

705
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:32,943
If you have an extraterrestrial's head
in there, you're the third guy this week.

706
01:08:35,487 --> 01:08:38,365
- Where the hell did you get that?
- In the garbage.

707
01:08:39,116 --> 01:08:40,867
In the garbage?

708
01:08:42,577 --> 01:08:44,288
He must've given up.

709
01:08:44,663 --> 01:08:49,376
Thrown in the towel.
Abandoned his sad little masquerade.

710
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:53,422
I finally got to him.
The power of the press triumphs.

711
01:08:53,588 --> 01:08:58,385
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, look, I think
I deserve a little something for this.

712
01:08:58,552 --> 01:09:01,680
- Give you 50 bucks.
- I could get more than that on eBay.

713
01:09:01,847 --> 01:09:04,850
All right, 100. Give this man his money
and throw in a bar of soap.

714
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:07,853
Your wife is still on that line.

715
01:09:08,228 --> 01:09:10,814
- <i>...about the flowers again.</i>
- Flowers? How much?

716
01:09:11,398 --> 01:09:14,568
You spend any more on this thing,
you can pick the daisies off my grave.

717
01:09:14,735 --> 01:09:16,028
Get plastic.

718
01:09:17,154 --> 01:09:19,156
Gotta go, big story.

Come on, come on.

724
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:57,152
Help!

Come on!

726
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:10,874
It wasn't fair to have gone like that.

727
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:13,585
He was a peaceful man.

728
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:17,631
And it was all my doing.

729
01:10:50,372 --> 01:10:53,834
Aunt May.
You don't have to punish yourself.

730
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,211
Oh, I know I shouldn't.

731
01:10:56,378 --> 01:10:59,589
It's just that you wanted
to take the subway...

732
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:02,092
...and he wanted to drive you.

733
01:11:02,259 --> 01:11:05,095
And if only I had stopped him...

734
01:11:05,262 --> 01:11:08,890
...we'd all three of us
be having tea together.

735
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:26,533
I'm responsible.

736
01:11:29,661 --> 01:11:31,371
For what?

737
01:11:31,872 --> 01:11:34,082
For what happened to Uncle Ben.

738
01:11:34,249 --> 01:11:36,668
But you were at the library.

739
01:11:36,835 --> 01:11:38,670
You were doing your homework.

740
01:11:38,837 --> 01:11:42,340
He drove me to the library,
but I never went in.

741
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:44,801
What do you mean?

742
01:11:45,177 --> 01:11:46,845
I went someplace else.

743
01:11:47,012 --> 01:11:50,390
Someplace where I thought
I could win some money...

744
01:11:51,183 --> 01:11:54,436
...to buy a car, because I wanted to...

745
01:11:54,978 --> 01:11:57,522
...impress Mary Jane.

746
01:11:59,232 --> 01:12:01,735
It happened so fast.

747
01:12:02,402 --> 01:12:06,740
I won the money, and the guy wouldn't
pay me. Then he got robbed.

748
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:09,743
The thief...

749
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:12,704
...was running towards me.

750
01:12:13,788 --> 01:12:17,125
I could've stopped him, but I wanted...

751
01:12:17,292 --> 01:12:19,377
...revenge.

752
01:12:20,879 --> 01:12:22,923
I let him go.

753
01:12:24,299 --> 01:12:27,719
I let him get away.

754
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:34,893
He wanted a car.

755
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:37,812
He tried to take Uncle Ben's.

756
01:12:38,605 --> 01:12:42,400
Uncle Ben said no...

757
01:12:43,318 --> 01:12:44,569
...and then he shot him.

758
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:53,119
Uncle Ben was killed that night...

759
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:57,832
...for being the only one
who did the right thing.

760
01:13:00,669 --> 01:13:02,295
And I...

761
01:13:05,382 --> 01:13:07,968
I held his hand...

762
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:10,303
...when he died.

763
01:13:17,269 --> 01:13:20,480
I've tried to tell you so many times.

764
01:14:16,745 --> 01:14:18,913
Just one more little chore.

765
01:14:26,546 --> 01:14:28,381
Where are you?

766
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:33,637
- I'm leaving for the night, sir.
- Fine.

767
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:36,681
Your father only obsessed over his work.

768
01:14:36,848 --> 01:14:38,892
Good night, Bernard.

769
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:33,321
Hello, Harry.

770
01:15:33,488 --> 01:15:36,116
Otto. What do you want?

771
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:38,618
That precious tritium.

772
01:15:38,785 --> 01:15:40,412
But I need more of it this time.

773
01:15:42,163 --> 01:15:46,167
More tritium, are you crazy?
You'll destroy the city! You're a hack!

774
01:15:49,504 --> 01:15:52,132
Hey. Hey! Hey!

775
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:55,051
Stop! Stop! All right!

776
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:59,639
All right, all right, all right.
Put me down. We'll make a deal.

777
01:16:05,019 --> 01:16:06,396
Easy.

778
01:16:09,357 --> 01:16:12,569
Kill Spider-Man, I'll give you
all the tritium you need.

779
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:17,323
On second thought, bring him to me alive.

780
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:18,742
How do I find him?

781
01:16:20,034 --> 01:16:21,703
- Peter Parker.
- Parker?

782
01:16:21,870 --> 01:16:24,164
He takes pictures of Spider-Man
for the <i>Bugle</i>.

783
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:25,790
Make him tell you where he is.

784
01:16:31,546 --> 01:16:32,881
Have it ready.

785
01:16:36,801 --> 01:16:38,553
Don't hurt Peter!

786
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:54,194
Somebody, help!

787
01:16:54,903 --> 01:16:56,488
Fire!

788
01:17:04,704 --> 01:17:07,665
Alisa, the Chens can't find their daughter.
Have you seen her?

789
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:12,337
Somebody call the fire department! Help!

790
01:17:12,504 --> 01:17:14,756
- Help!
- Is anybody in that building?

791
01:17:14,923 --> 01:17:17,592
We think there's a kid
stuck on the second floor.

792
01:17:17,759 --> 01:17:19,886
Hey, where you going?!

793
01:17:40,615 --> 01:17:42,450
I'm coming!

794
01:18:06,641 --> 01:18:09,352
It's okay. It's okay. Come here.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

795
01:18:09,519 --> 01:18:10,687
Come on. Come on.

796
01:18:57,692 --> 01:18:58,943
Come on.

797
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:14,250
Mama.

798
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:27,847
You got some guts, kid.

799
01:19:28,014 --> 01:19:31,059
Some poor soul got trapped
on the fourth floor.

800
01:19:31,225 --> 01:19:32,936
Never made it out.

801
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:35,104
Oh, man.

802
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:40,693
All right, Billy, let's knock it down and
roll them up. Get on out of here.

803
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:45,281
Let's pick it up! Let's get all this
equipment, let's go! Let's move it!

804
01:19:50,453 --> 01:19:54,082
Am I not supposed to have what I want?

805
01:19:54,457 --> 01:19:56,417
What I need?

806
01:19:58,252 --> 01:20:01,172
What am I supposed to do?

807
01:20:07,387 --> 01:20:09,013
I shouldn't have without...

808
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:11,307
...knocking.

809
01:20:15,395 --> 01:20:17,105
Come in.

810
01:20:20,066 --> 01:20:22,944
- Hi.
- Hi.

811
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:29,200
Would you like a piece of chocolate cake?

812
01:20:30,827 --> 01:20:32,245
Okay.

813
01:20:33,705 --> 01:20:35,790
And a glass of milk?

814
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:40,545
That would be nice.

815
01:20:42,130 --> 01:20:43,172
Okay.

816
01:21:04,485 --> 01:21:06,320
Thank you.

817
01:21:11,075 --> 01:21:13,077
You got a message.

818
01:21:13,703 --> 01:21:15,288
It's your aunt.

819
01:21:15,455 --> 01:21:17,123
Thanks.

820
01:21:33,181 --> 01:21:34,515
What's going on?

821
01:21:34,682 --> 01:21:38,478
Oh, they gave me another few weeks,
but I decided the hell with it.

822
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:42,648
I'm moving on.
I found a small apartment.

823
01:21:42,815 --> 01:21:44,025
Why didn't you tell me?

824
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:47,445
I'm quite able to take
care of things myself.

825
01:21:47,612 --> 01:21:50,990
And Henry Jackson across
the street is giving me a hand...

826
01:21:51,157 --> 01:21:52,658
...and I'm giving him $5.

827
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:54,911
- That's Henry Jackson?
- Yes.

828
01:21:55,078 --> 01:21:57,288
It's funny what happens in two years.

829
01:21:57,455 --> 01:22:01,375
Nine years old, has great ambitions.

830
01:22:02,627 --> 01:22:05,963
Listen, about my last visit...

831
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:08,257
Pish-posh, we needn't talk about it.

832
01:22:08,424 --> 01:22:10,760
It's water over the dam
or under the bridge...

833
01:22:10,927 --> 01:22:13,179
...or wherever you like it.

834
01:22:16,516 --> 01:22:20,269
But you made a brave move
in telling me the truth.

835
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:22,897
And I'm proud of you.

836
01:22:23,606 --> 01:22:26,359
And I thank you, and I...

837
01:22:27,193 --> 01:22:29,987
I love you, Peter.

838
01:22:30,863 --> 01:22:33,825
So very, very much.

839
01:22:52,844 --> 01:22:55,888
Hey. Where are all my comic books?

840
01:22:56,055 --> 01:22:58,891
Those dreadful things?
I gave those away.

841
01:23:01,936 --> 01:23:05,231
- I put the pans in the box, Mrs. Parker.
- Thank you, Henry.

842
01:23:05,398 --> 01:23:07,024
- Hi, Peter.
- Hey, Henry.

843
01:23:07,191 --> 01:23:08,442
You're getting tall.

844
01:23:08,609 --> 01:23:12,738
Henry, why don't you put those
cookbooks in with the mixer?

845
01:23:12,905 --> 01:23:15,992
Okay. You take Spider-Man's pictures, right?

846
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:19,537
- I used to.
- Where is he?

847
01:23:19,704 --> 01:23:24,041
Henry and I agree. We don't see
his picture in the paper anymore.

848
01:23:26,002 --> 01:23:27,503
He...

849
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:32,091
- ...quit.
- Why?

850
01:23:33,009 --> 01:23:34,760
Wanted to try other things.

851
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:36,637
He'll be back, right?

852
01:23:37,972 --> 01:23:39,599
I don't know.

853
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:43,936
You'll never guess who he wants to be.

854
01:23:44,103 --> 01:23:45,855
Spider-Man.

855
01:23:46,022 --> 01:23:49,942
- Why?
- He knows a hero when he sees one.

856
01:23:50,109 --> 01:23:53,821
Too few characters out there,
flying around like that...

857
01:23:53,988 --> 01:23:56,073
...saving old girls like me.

858
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:59,994
And Lord knows,
kids like Henry need a hero.

859
01:24:00,161 --> 01:24:03,039
Courageous, self-sacrificing people...

860
01:24:03,206 --> 01:24:05,833
...setting examples for all of us.

861
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,377
Everybody loves a hero.

862
01:24:08,711 --> 01:24:12,131
People line up for them. Cheer them.
Scream their names.

863
01:24:12,298 --> 01:24:16,469
And years later, they'll tell how
they stood in the rain for hours...

864
01:24:16,636 --> 01:24:18,346
...just to get a glimpse of the one...

865
01:24:18,512 --> 01:24:22,391
...who taught them to hold on
a second longer.

866
01:24:23,309 --> 01:24:26,938
I believe there's a hero in all of us...

867
01:24:27,313 --> 01:24:29,649
...that keeps us honest...

868
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:31,442
...gives us strength...

869
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:34,153
...makes us noble...

870
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:38,783
...and finally allows us to die with pride.

871
01:24:39,492 --> 01:24:43,663
Even though sometimes
we have to be steady...

872
01:24:43,829 --> 01:24:46,999
...and give up the thing we want the most.

873
01:24:48,334 --> 01:24:50,795
Even our dreams.

874
01:24:52,171 --> 01:24:54,882
Spider-Man did that for Henry...

875
01:24:55,049 --> 01:24:58,010
...and he wonders where he's gone.

876
01:24:58,678 --> 01:25:00,513
He needs him.

877
01:25:04,934 --> 01:25:10,022
Do you think you could lift that desk
and put it into the garage for me?

878
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:12,400
But don't strain yourself.

879
01:25:12,566 --> 01:25:14,110
Okay.

880
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:35,339
Strong focus on what I want.

881
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:06,704
I'm back!

882
01:26:06,871 --> 01:26:08,164
I'm back!

883
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:27,683
My back.

884
01:26:28,142 --> 01:26:29,977
My back.

885
01:26:53,667 --> 01:26:58,005
Honey, you sure you don't want to invite
your friend, the photographer?

886
01:26:58,589 --> 01:26:59,757
Peter Parker?

887
01:27:01,884 --> 01:27:04,637
- Positive.
- Thought he was your pal.

888
01:27:05,012 --> 01:27:07,556
- Peter Parker?
- Yeah.

889
01:27:08,265 --> 01:27:11,018
He's just a great big jerk.

890
01:27:11,185 --> 01:27:12,937
The world's full of great big jerks.

891
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:16,482
You're adorable.

892
01:27:16,649 --> 01:27:18,818
It's just the uniform.

893
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:23,614
Lean your head back for me.

894
01:27:23,989 --> 01:27:26,784
- Put my head back?
- Yeah, just do it.

895
01:27:28,452 --> 01:27:30,454
Just put my head back?

896
01:27:30,830 --> 01:27:32,581
Okay.

897
01:27:53,811 --> 01:27:55,980
I'm back on the moon.

898
01:28:00,192 --> 01:28:02,194
You up there with me?

899
01:28:22,506 --> 01:28:24,592
- Hi.
- Surprised?

900
01:28:24,758 --> 01:28:26,343
Very.

901
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:29,513
- Thanks for coming.
- Everything okay?

902
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:33,309
You might say so.

903
01:28:34,393 --> 01:28:38,397
This is funny.
I'm not sure how to begin.

904
01:28:40,649 --> 01:28:43,235
You know how our minds play tricks on us.

905
01:28:43,694 --> 01:28:47,865
- Tell me about it.
- Well, mine did a real number on me.

906
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:52,870
Some part of me heard what you had
to say after the show that night...

907
01:28:53,037 --> 01:28:54,914
...that you were different.

908
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,582
But I didn't want to listen.

909
01:28:57,458 --> 01:28:59,919
I was afraid to trust you.

910
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:04,173
But I've been thinking about it...

911
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:08,385
Listen, there's more for me to say.

912
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:15,893
I maybe rushed into things. I thought...

913
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:18,896
Wait a minute. What are you saying?

914
01:29:19,396 --> 01:29:23,734
I'm saying I...

915
01:29:27,363 --> 01:29:30,699
I thought I could be there
for you, Mary Jane...

916
01:29:30,866 --> 01:29:32,785
...but I can't.

917
01:29:35,788 --> 01:29:39,416
My mind was playing tricks too.

918
01:29:43,754 --> 01:29:46,757
Do you love me, or not?

919
01:29:53,389 --> 01:29:55,015
I...

920
01:29:58,310 --> 01:29:59,979
...don't.

921
01:30:04,358 --> 01:30:05,401
You don't.

922
01:30:15,869 --> 01:30:17,329
Kiss me.

923
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:20,833
Kiss you?

924
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,835
I need to know something.

925
01:30:25,421 --> 01:30:27,339
Just one kiss.

926
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:15,387
What's happening?

927
01:31:26,565 --> 01:31:28,651
Peter Parker...

928
01:31:29,068 --> 01:31:30,819
...and the girlfriend.

929
01:31:31,278 --> 01:31:32,404
What do you want?

930
01:31:35,824 --> 01:31:37,993
I want you to find your
friend Spider-Man.

931
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:40,829
Tell him to meet me
at the Westside Tower at 3:00.

932
01:31:40,996 --> 01:31:42,122
I don't know where he is.

933
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:46,210
Find him.

934
01:31:48,545 --> 01:31:51,382
Or I'll peel the flesh off her bones.

935
01:31:51,548 --> 01:31:53,467
If you lay one finger on her...

936
01:31:53,634 --> 01:31:55,469
You'll do what?

937
01:33:08,792 --> 01:33:12,504
Still no word on the whereabouts
of your son's fiancée.

938
01:33:12,671 --> 01:33:14,715
Sorry, Jonah.

939
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:17,384
It's all my fault.

940
01:33:18,635 --> 01:33:21,138
I drove Spider-Man away.

941
01:33:21,305 --> 01:33:24,725
He was the only one who
could've stopped Octavius.

942
01:33:25,893 --> 01:33:27,603
Yes.

943
01:33:28,771 --> 01:33:32,441
Spider-Man was a hero.

944
01:33:33,317 --> 01:33:35,986
I just couldn't see it.

945
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:38,238
He was a...

946
01:33:38,405 --> 01:33:41,200
A thief! A criminal!

947
01:33:42,659 --> 01:33:44,953
He stole my suit.
He's a menace to the entire city!

948
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:48,248
I want that wall-crawling
arachnid prosecuted!

949
01:33:48,415 --> 01:33:50,501
I want him strung up by his web!

950
01:33:51,919 --> 01:33:54,588
I want Spider-Man!

951
01:34:23,116 --> 01:34:24,493
Where is she?

952
01:34:24,660 --> 01:34:27,204
Oh, she'll be just fine. Let's talk.

953
01:35:18,547 --> 01:35:19,631
What the hell?

954
01:37:24,631 --> 01:37:26,925
You have a train to catch.

955
01:37:29,219 --> 01:37:31,138
Help!

956
01:37:31,304 --> 01:37:35,600
Help! Help! I can't stop it!
The brakes are gone!

957
01:37:54,411 --> 01:37:56,913
- It's Spider-Man.
- Oh, my God, this is it!

958
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:58,540
Tell everyone to hang on!

959
01:37:58,707 --> 01:38:00,667
Brace yourselves!

960
01:38:21,688 --> 01:38:24,232
Any more bright ideas?

961
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:27,027
I got a few, yeah!

962
01:38:48,131 --> 01:38:50,258
Whoa, watch out!

963
01:39:20,539 --> 01:39:21,790
We're slowing down.

964
01:39:36,471 --> 01:39:37,514
Oh, no!

965
01:40:26,188 --> 01:40:28,690
Nice and easy, we'll go down.

966
01:40:29,149 --> 01:40:30,942
Slower. Gently.

967
01:40:35,906 --> 01:40:37,866
Is he alive?

968
01:40:41,036 --> 01:40:42,245
He's...

969
01:40:42,412 --> 01:40:44,164
...just a kid.

970
01:40:45,332 --> 01:40:47,626
No older than my son.

971
01:41:06,978 --> 01:41:08,730
It's all right.

972
01:41:12,567 --> 01:41:14,861
We found something.

973
01:41:23,787 --> 01:41:26,122
We won't tell nobody.

974
01:41:39,552 --> 01:41:42,180
It's good to have you back, Spider-Man.

975
01:42:02,075 --> 01:42:03,702
He's mine!

976
01:42:04,661 --> 01:42:07,539
You want to get to him,
you gotta go through me.

977
01:42:07,706 --> 01:42:09,457
And me.

978
01:42:09,624 --> 01:42:11,459
Me too.

979
01:42:15,964 --> 01:42:17,549
Very well.

980
01:42:46,661 --> 01:42:48,455
Where do you want him?

981
01:42:56,296 --> 01:42:58,173
And the tritium?

982
01:43:12,312 --> 01:43:14,481
Yes.

983
01:43:43,802 --> 01:43:46,971
If only I could cause you the pain
that you've caused me.

984
01:43:49,682 --> 01:43:52,185
First we'll see who's behind the mask.

985
01:43:52,352 --> 01:43:54,729
I can look into your eyes as you die.

986
01:43:57,524 --> 01:43:59,025
Pete.

987
01:43:59,442 --> 01:44:00,985
No.

988
01:44:01,736 --> 01:44:03,446
It can't be.

989
01:44:09,702 --> 01:44:11,204
Harry.

990
01:44:12,539 --> 01:44:16,334
Where is she?
Where is he keeping her?

991
01:44:17,335 --> 01:44:21,297
- He's got M.J.
- No. All he wanted was the tritium.

992
01:44:22,048 --> 01:44:23,675
Tritium?

993
01:44:25,343 --> 01:44:27,762
He's making the machine again.

994
01:44:28,179 --> 01:44:32,392
When that happens, she'll die,
along with half of New York.

995
01:44:32,559 --> 01:44:35,687
- Now, where is he?
- Peter...

996
01:44:36,521 --> 01:44:38,731
...you killed my father.

997
01:44:43,528 --> 01:44:46,781
There are bigger things
happening here than me and you.

998
01:44:48,366 --> 01:44:51,578
Harry, please, I've got to stop him.

999
01:45:01,713 --> 01:45:03,423
Hey!

1000
01:45:04,507 --> 01:45:06,176
Hey!

1001
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:09,554
I'm talking to you!

1002
01:45:09,721 --> 01:45:13,266
You got what you needed for your
little science project, now let me go.

1003
01:45:13,433 --> 01:45:15,268
I can't let you go,
you'd bring the police.

1004
01:45:15,435 --> 01:45:17,937
Not that anybody could stop me
now that Spider-Man's dead.

1005
01:45:18,897 --> 01:45:20,565
He's not dead.

1006
01:45:20,732 --> 01:45:22,484
- I don't believe you.
- Believe it.

1007
01:45:41,002 --> 01:45:42,754
Surprise.

1008
01:45:46,758 --> 01:45:48,426
As soon as you get free...

1009
01:45:50,595 --> 01:45:54,641
I should have known Osborn wouldn't
have the spine to finish you!

1010
01:45:54,807 --> 01:45:57,852
Shut it down, Ock. You're gonna
hurt a lot more people this time.

1011
01:45:58,019 --> 01:46:00,313
Well, that's a risk we're willing to take.

1012
01:46:01,523 --> 01:46:02,565
Well, I'm not.

1013
01:46:35,932 --> 01:46:37,058
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1014
01:46:53,074 --> 01:46:54,409
Run!

1015
01:47:18,891 --> 01:47:21,269
Let's see you scurry out of this.

1016
01:47:45,084 --> 01:47:46,127
Now what?

1017
01:48:17,325 --> 01:48:18,409
Dr. Octavius.

1018
01:48:22,705 --> 01:48:23,873
We have to shut it down.

1019
01:48:24,749 --> 01:48:26,334
Please tell me how.

1020
01:48:26,501 --> 01:48:28,378
Peter Parker?

1021
01:48:31,506 --> 01:48:33,549
"Brilliant but lazy."

1022
01:48:33,883 --> 01:48:35,259
Look at what's happening.

1023
01:48:36,260 --> 01:48:38,221
We must destroy it.

1024
01:48:43,768 --> 01:48:45,812
I can't destroy it.

1025
01:48:50,650 --> 01:48:52,318
I won't.

1026
01:48:57,573 --> 01:48:59,742
You once spoke to me about intelligence.

1027
01:49:01,619 --> 01:49:05,581
That it was a gift to be used
for the good of mankind.

1028
01:49:07,041 --> 01:49:08,793
A privilege.

1029
01:49:09,127 --> 01:49:12,505
These things have turned you
into something you're not.

1030
01:49:13,214 --> 01:49:15,425
Don't listen to them.

1031
01:49:20,888 --> 01:49:22,515
It was my dream.

1032
01:49:22,682 --> 01:49:27,186
Sometimes, to do what's right,
we have to be steady...

1033
01:49:27,353 --> 01:49:29,856
...and give up the thing we want the most.

1034
01:49:30,690 --> 01:49:32,859
Even our dreams.

1035
01:49:38,364 --> 01:49:40,032
You're right.

1036
01:49:47,540 --> 01:49:49,167
He's right.

1037
01:49:51,043 --> 01:49:52,628
Listen.

1038
01:49:54,839 --> 01:49:57,216
Listen to me now.

1039
01:50:00,011 --> 01:50:02,305
Listen to me now.

1040
01:50:06,017 --> 01:50:09,020
Now, tell me how to stop it.

1041
01:50:10,104 --> 01:50:11,773
It can't be stopped.

1042
01:50:13,191 --> 01:50:15,318
It's self-sustaining now.

1043
01:50:15,485 --> 01:50:17,445
- Think!
- Unless...

1044
01:50:19,071 --> 01:50:20,823
The river.

1045
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:23,785
Drown it.

1046
01:50:25,620 --> 01:50:27,079
I'll do it.

1047
01:51:12,458 --> 01:51:15,711
No!

1048
01:51:27,014 --> 01:51:28,182
Hi.

1049
01:51:29,308 --> 01:51:30,560
Hi.

1050
01:51:31,853 --> 01:51:33,229
This is really heavy.

1051
01:51:57,837 --> 01:51:58,880
M.J.

1052
01:52:00,756 --> 01:52:02,550
In case we die...

1053
01:52:02,717 --> 01:52:04,260
You do love me.

1054
01:52:04,802 --> 01:52:06,053
I do.

1055
01:52:07,013 --> 01:52:09,098
Even though you said you didn't.

1056
01:52:12,018 --> 01:52:14,770
I will not die a monster.

1057
01:53:19,710 --> 01:53:22,046
I think I always knew...

1058
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:24,840
...all this time...

1059
01:53:25,675 --> 01:53:27,551
...who you really were.

1060
01:53:28,052 --> 01:53:30,972
Then you know why we can't be together.

1061
01:53:31,847 --> 01:53:34,892
Spider-Man will always have enemies.

1062
01:53:36,644 --> 01:53:39,647
I can't let you take that risk.

1063
01:53:44,151 --> 01:53:46,028
I will...

1064
01:53:47,113 --> 01:53:49,991
...always be Spider-Man.

1065
01:53:52,118 --> 01:53:54,662
You and I can never be.

1066
01:54:42,877 --> 01:54:44,879
Mary Jane!

1067
01:55:48,067 --> 01:55:49,735
Hello?

1068
01:56:05,709 --> 01:56:07,253
Who's that?

1069
01:56:07,419 --> 01:56:09,171
Son.

1070
01:56:10,214 --> 01:56:11,799
I'm here.

1071
01:56:12,883 --> 01:56:14,760
Dad?

1072
01:56:15,719 --> 01:56:18,180
- I thought you were...
- No.

1073
01:56:18,347 --> 01:56:20,599
I'm alive in you, Harry.

1074
01:56:20,766 --> 01:56:21,976
Now it's your turn.

1075
01:56:23,352 --> 01:56:26,397
You swore to make Spider-Man pay.

1076
01:56:26,564 --> 01:56:28,440
Now make him pay.

1077
01:56:28,607 --> 01:56:30,276
But Pete's my best friend.

1078
01:56:30,442 --> 01:56:31,986
And I'm your father.

1079
01:56:32,903 --> 01:56:34,780
You're weak.

1080
01:56:35,406 --> 01:56:39,994
You were always weak. You'll always
be weak until you take control.

1081
01:56:40,744 --> 01:56:44,123
Now you know the truth about Peter.

1082
01:56:44,540 --> 01:56:46,625
Be strong, Harry.

1083
01:56:47,084 --> 01:56:48,878
Avenge me.

1084
01:56:51,338 --> 01:56:53,340
- Avenge me!
- No!

1085
01:59:17,985 --> 01:59:19,528
Call Deborah.

1086
01:59:19,695 --> 01:59:22,031
The... The caterer?

1087
01:59:22,406 --> 01:59:24,908
Tell her not to open the caviar.

1088
02:00:05,991 --> 02:00:08,577
Had to do what I had to do.

1089
02:00:09,703 --> 02:00:11,789
Mary Jane.

1090
02:00:12,206 --> 02:00:13,999
Peter.

1091
02:00:14,708 --> 02:00:17,628
I can't survive without you.

1092
02:00:27,262 --> 02:00:29,640
You shouldn't be here.

1093
02:00:30,182 --> 02:00:33,811
I know you think we can't be together.

1094
02:00:34,311 --> 02:00:38,273
But can't you respect me enough
to let me make my own decision?

1095
02:00:39,191 --> 02:00:40,984
I know there'll be risks.

1096
02:00:41,860 --> 02:00:45,072
But I wanna face them with you.

1097
02:00:45,614 --> 02:00:48,992
It's wrong that we should
only be half-alive...

1098
02:00:49,159 --> 02:00:51,370
...half of ourselves.

1099
02:00:53,372 --> 02:00:55,499
I love you.

1100
02:00:57,334 --> 02:01:00,629
So here I am, standing in your doorway.

1101
02:01:01,964 --> 02:01:05,342
I've always been standing
in your doorway.

1102
02:01:12,099 --> 02:01:15,978
Isn't it about time
somebody saved your life?

1103
02:01:21,567 --> 02:01:23,777
Well, say something.

1104
02:01:25,904 --> 02:01:28,740
Thank you, Mary Jane Watson.

1105
02:01:44,590 --> 02:01:46,550
Go get them, tiger.
