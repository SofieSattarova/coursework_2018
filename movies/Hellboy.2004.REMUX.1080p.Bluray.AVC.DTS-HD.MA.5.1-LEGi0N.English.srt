1
00:00:58,602 --> 00:01:02,314
<i>What is it that makes a man a man?</i>

2
00:01:02,648 --> 00:01:06,109
<i>Is it his origins,
the way things start?</i>

3
00:01:06,318 --> 00:01:10,447
<i>Or is it something else,
something harder to describe?</i>

4
00:01:10,822 --> 00:01:14,326
<i>For me, it all began in 1944.</i>

5
00:01:14,493 --> 00:01:17,746
<i>Classified mission
off the coast of Scotland.</i>

6
00:01:18,247 --> 00:01:20,332
<i>The Nazis were desperate.</i>

7
00:01:20,499 --> 00:01:22,960
<i>Combining science and black magic...</i>

8
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:26,505
<i>...they intended to upset
the balance of the war.</i>

9
00:01:26,922 --> 00:01:32,177
<i>I was 28, already a paranormal
advisor to President Roosevelt.</i>

10
00:01:32,427 --> 00:01:36,890
<i>I could never have suspected
that what would transpire that night...</i>

11
00:01:37,057 --> 00:01:40,102
<i>...would not only affect
the course of history...</i>

12
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,980
<i>...but change my life forever.</i>

13
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:44,690
All right, men, let's go. Move!

14
00:01:50,654 --> 00:01:52,864
Come on! Come on! Come on!

15
00:01:53,949 --> 00:01:55,200
Let's fan it out.

16
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:02,708
Your men...

17
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:04,793
...they'll need these.

18
00:02:07,671 --> 00:02:09,047
Are you a Catholic?

19
00:02:09,214 --> 00:02:12,634
Yes. Among other things.
But that's hardly the point.

20
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:14,678
Well, you're gonna need
one of these.

21
00:02:15,554 --> 00:02:17,222
I abhor the use of violence.

22
00:02:17,806 --> 00:02:21,059
Thank you. I wouldn't want you
to think me mad, Sergeant Whitman.

23
00:02:21,226 --> 00:02:23,812
No, three days too late for that,
Professor Broom.

24
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:27,149
All right, you guys,
let's move, move, move, move!

25
00:02:27,941 --> 00:02:29,484
This way! Left, right!

26
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:31,611
Come on, men, let's get the lead out!

27
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:32,779
We're close!

28
00:02:32,946 --> 00:02:36,283
You're wasting our time. There's
nothing here but sheep and rocks.

29
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,410
- Ruins, not rocks.
- Hold it right here!

30
00:02:38,577 --> 00:02:42,039
The remains of Trondham Abbey,
built on an intersection of ley lines...

31
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:44,416
...the boundaries between
our world and the others...

32
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,543
What a load of crap!

33
00:02:46,752 --> 00:02:49,921
Hell, a week ago, I never even heard
the word "parabnormal."

34
00:02:50,088 --> 00:02:51,423
Paranormal.

35
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,175
Move it!

36
00:02:54,593 --> 00:02:55,927
Hold the line.

37
00:02:56,636 --> 00:02:57,804
Come on!

38
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:05,520
Sweet Jesus.

39
00:03:14,571 --> 00:03:16,656
They must be here for the sheep.

40
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:32,381
The freak in the gas mask...

41
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:35,008
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen.

42
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:40,472
Hitler's top assassin
and head of the Thule Occult Society.

43
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:44,768
If he's here, this is worse
than I thought.

44
00:04:09,835 --> 00:04:12,003
No matter what happens tonight...

45
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,173
...this book will guide you
back to me.

46
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,342
I will not leave you.

47
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:22,347
I grant you everlasting life...

48
00:04:22,556 --> 00:04:23,682
...youth...

49
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:26,977
...and the power to serve me.

50
00:04:29,438 --> 00:04:31,273
Ilsa! Grigori!

51
00:04:32,023 --> 00:04:33,024
It's time.

52
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:47,038
Five years of research
and construction, Grigori.

53
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:48,540
Five years!

54
00:04:48,707 --> 00:04:51,042
The Führer doesn't look kindly
on failure.

55
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:53,879
There will be no failure, general.

56
00:04:54,254 --> 00:04:57,007
I promised Herr Hitler a miracle.

57
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:02,053
I'll deliver one.

58
00:05:11,563 --> 00:05:14,983
What I will do tonight
can never be undone!

59
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,235
I will open a portal...

60
00:05:17,736 --> 00:05:20,280
...and awaken the Ogdru Jahad:

61
00:05:20,447 --> 00:05:23,158
The Seven Gods of Chaos!

62
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:26,411
Our enemies will be destroyed!

63
00:05:26,578 --> 00:05:28,747
And from the ashes...

64
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:33,293
...a new Eden will arise.

65
00:06:58,003 --> 00:06:59,671
Get down!

66
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:04,050
I was taking a picture.

67
00:07:04,217 --> 00:07:06,845
You do that again
and I'll carve you a new one.

68
00:07:07,012 --> 00:07:09,264
Listen, the portal is open.

69
00:07:09,431 --> 00:07:12,517
Do you understand?
We have to stop them.

70
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:45,717
Go! Go! Go! Go!

71
00:07:57,896 --> 00:07:59,230
Look out!

72
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,443
Get down!

73
00:09:29,654 --> 00:09:31,197
It's almost over.

74
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:32,824
No, it's not.

75
00:09:35,243 --> 00:09:37,328
The portal's been open for too long.

76
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:39,664
Something may have come through.

77
00:09:39,831 --> 00:09:42,834
Have your men search
the area thoroughly.

78
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:48,173
Spread out over that way!

79
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:54,679
Sir! Something up here!

80
00:09:56,598 --> 00:09:58,349
He's gone.

81
00:09:58,516 --> 00:10:00,477
For now.

82
00:10:02,604 --> 00:10:05,690
When you said something
came through...

83
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:07,901
From where?

84
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:14,574
I don't see them!

85
00:10:20,747 --> 00:10:25,001
Do you really, really believe in hell?

86
00:10:26,586 --> 00:10:29,422
There is a place,
a dark place...

87
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:33,635
...where ancient evil slumbers
and waits to return.

88
00:10:33,802 --> 00:10:36,971
- Grigori gave us a glance tonight.
- Grigori?

89
00:10:37,305 --> 00:10:39,724
That's Russian, right?

90
00:10:39,891 --> 00:10:42,227
Grigori Efimovich Rasputin.

91
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:43,520
Rasputin?

92
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:47,106
- Come on!
- Occult adviser to the Romanovs.

93
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:50,068
In 1916, at a dinner in his honor...

94
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:55,156
...he was poisoned, shot,
stabbed, clubbed...

95
00:10:55,365 --> 00:10:58,368
...castrated and finally drowned.

96
00:10:58,535 --> 00:11:01,913
And yet, we saw him here tonight.

97
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:04,165
Professor Broom.

98
00:11:08,253 --> 00:11:10,088
Careful. Be careful.

99
00:11:33,444 --> 00:11:35,572
- What the hell is that? An ape?
- No.

100
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:38,283
It was red. Bright red.

101
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:40,410
Lower your light, you're scaring it.

102
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:44,247
- What are you two shooting at?
- A red ape!

103
00:11:44,414 --> 00:11:46,958
No, it's not an ape.

104
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:49,961
It's got a big stone in its hand.

105
00:11:50,128 --> 00:11:53,006
I think that is its hand.

106
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:55,425
Look at the size of that whammer.

107
00:11:57,552 --> 00:12:00,388
No, wait! Wait!

108
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:35,465
A blanket. Get me a blanket.

109
00:12:39,385 --> 00:12:42,597
Come on. Come on. It's safe.

110
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:43,932
Jump down.

111
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:46,351
Come on. Jump down.

112
00:12:51,022 --> 00:12:52,690
It's a boy.

113
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,818
It's just a baby boy.

114
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:04,035
Move to the left.

115
00:13:04,202 --> 00:13:09,499
<i>There we were, an unready father
for an unwanted child.</i>

116
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:13,169
<i>The boys gave him a name
that very night.</i>

117
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:16,589
<i>In retrospect,
perhaps not the most fortunate.</i>

118
00:13:16,756 --> 00:13:20,551
<i>But nevertheless,
a name we all came to use.</i>

119
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:24,180
<i>We called him Hellboy.</i>

120
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:28,685
Look at the birdie.

121
00:13:41,197 --> 00:13:42,865
<i>Speculation about the origins...</i>

122
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,373
<i>Evidence that Hellboy...</i>

123
00:14:04,137 --> 00:14:06,764
<i>So, what is it exactly
that you say this agency does?</i>

124
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:10,226
<i>I kid you not. It hunts monsters.</i>

125
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:20,319
<i>The claim, of course,
that this creature...</i>

126
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:22,655
<i>...works for the FBI
as a monster hunter.</i>

127
00:14:58,316 --> 00:15:01,319
What you seek is in there.

128
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:37,355
This is a sacred place.

129
00:15:44,028 --> 00:15:45,196
Give me my gold.

130
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,658
We shouldn't be here.

131
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:46,591
Master.

132
00:16:57,226 --> 00:17:00,146
- Have you told him yet?
- No.

133
00:17:01,272 --> 00:17:02,398
You should.

134
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,613
- I'll notify his family.
- He has no family.

135
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:10,823
According to this file, he does.

136
00:17:11,616 --> 00:17:13,951
He has a son.

137
00:17:18,748 --> 00:17:19,790
Hurry up!

138
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,543
- Hurry up!
- Wait right here!

139
00:17:24,045 --> 00:17:27,131
<i>Tom Manning is the head
of special operations at the FBI.</i>

140
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:31,010
<i>He joins Pat in the studio tonight
to go over the latest Hellboy sighting.</i>

141
00:17:31,177 --> 00:17:34,013
There. That's the tail.

142
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,182
And these are the horns.

143
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:37,475
I have a question.

144
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:43,731
In the pictures of aliens, UFO,
the yeti, Hellboy...

145
00:17:43,898 --> 00:17:46,692
...why is it they're
always out of focus?

146
00:17:47,652 --> 00:17:48,861
<i>Why don't you tell us...</i>

147
00:17:49,028 --> 00:17:51,989
<i>...about the Bureau of Paranormal
Research and Defense?</i>

148
00:17:52,156 --> 00:17:55,201
I wanna tell you, I wanna tell
the American public one thing.

149
00:17:55,368 --> 00:17:57,036
Now, this Bureau for the...

150
00:17:57,203 --> 00:18:00,331
Paranormal Research and Defense.

151
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:06,837
There is no such thing.

152
00:18:24,063 --> 00:18:25,940
"Waste Management Services"?

153
00:18:27,525 --> 00:18:28,693
<i>What is it?</i>

154
00:18:29,235 --> 00:18:31,904
John Myers, FBI.

155
00:18:32,113 --> 00:18:34,282
Transfer from Quantico.

156
00:18:35,116 --> 00:18:36,742
<i>Look at the birdie, son.</i>

157
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:02,810
- Hello. I'm John...
- You are late. That's what you are.

158
00:19:03,394 --> 00:19:05,479
- Five minutes.
- Yes, I know.

159
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:09,900
- I'm going to...
- Section 51. I know.

160
00:19:10,318 --> 00:19:12,445
Watch your hands and elbows.

161
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:15,114
- Pardon?
- Watch your hands and elbows.

162
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,101
Hello?

163
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:53,694
Turn the pages, please,
if you don't mind.

164
00:19:58,324 --> 00:19:59,909
Please.

165
00:20:00,368 --> 00:20:01,994
The pages.

166
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:03,954
These? You're reading these?

167
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:07,166
Four books at once, every day...

168
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,086
...as long as I'm there
to turn the pages.

169
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,712
My name's Broom.

170
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:13,631
Professor Trevor Broom.

171
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:14,799
Sir, I'm John...

172
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:17,301
Agent John T. Myers,
Kansas City, '76.

173
00:20:17,468 --> 00:20:19,804
T stands for Thaddeus,
mother's older brother.

174
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,139
Scar on your chin happened
when you were 10.

175
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:25,142
You still wonder if it's ever
going to fade away.

176
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:27,103
- How did it...?
- He.

177
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:29,397
Not "it."

178
00:20:30,606 --> 00:20:32,608
Abraham Sapien.

179
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:36,320
Discovered alive
in a secret chamber...

180
00:20:36,487 --> 00:20:39,323
...of St. Trinian's
Foundling Hospital, Washington.

181
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,659
His name was taken
from this inscription...

182
00:20:41,826 --> 00:20:44,412
- ...stuck to the side of his tank.
- "Icthyo Sapiens.

183
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:47,164
April 14, 1865."

184
00:20:47,415 --> 00:20:50,126
The day that Abraham Lincoln died.

185
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:52,670
Hence, Abe Sapien.

186
00:20:54,088 --> 00:20:55,381
Rotten eggs.

187
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:59,093
A delicacy. Abe loves them.

188
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,345
How does he know
so much about me?

189
00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:04,765
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.

190
00:21:06,142 --> 00:21:10,479
"Unique." That's a word you'll hear
frequently around here.

191
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:16,193
Sir, where am I, exactly?

192
00:21:17,153 --> 00:21:19,864
As you entered the lobby,
there was an inscription:

193
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:24,660
"In the absence of light,
darkness prevails."

194
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:28,205
There are things that go bump
in the night, Agent Myers.

195
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:29,999
Make no mistake about that.

196
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:34,545
And we are the ones
who bump back.

197
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:42,052
1937, Hitler joins
the Thule Society...

198
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:45,973
...a group of German aristocrats
obsessed with the occult.

199
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,519
1938, he acquired
the Spear of Longinus...

200
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:52,521
...which pierced the side of Christ.

201
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:54,773
He who holds it becomes invincible.

202
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,818
Hitler's power increases tenfold.

203
00:21:57,985 --> 00:22:01,780
1943, President Roosevelt
decides to fight back.

204
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:05,075
The Bureau of Paranormal
Research and Defense is born.

205
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:08,746
1958, the Occult Wars
finally come to an end...

206
00:22:08,913 --> 00:22:11,415
...with the death of Adolf Hitler.

207
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:14,752
1945, you mean.

208
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,587
Hitler died in '45.

209
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:19,298
Did he, now?

210
00:22:22,051 --> 00:22:24,762
Myers, this is Agent Clay.

211
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:26,305
Take his lead.

212
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:28,474
He'll make the introductions.

213
00:22:32,645 --> 00:22:34,230
You're not coming?

214
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:40,027
I handpicked you from a roster of over
70 academy graduates.

215
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:41,779
Make me proud.

216
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:44,782
They're not speaking.

217
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:47,451
Professor Broom had him grounded.

218
00:22:47,618 --> 00:22:49,954
Grounded? Who's grounded?

219
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:01,632
Okay. You saw the fish guy, right?

220
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,968
Oh, yeah. That was weird.

221
00:23:04,343 --> 00:23:05,803
Yeah. Right.

222
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:16,438
Well, come on in.
Meet the rest of the family.

223
00:23:17,398 --> 00:23:18,816
He gets fed six times a day.

224
00:23:18,983 --> 00:23:20,526
He's got a thing for cats.

225
00:23:20,693 --> 00:23:23,654
You'll be his nanny,
his keeper, his best friend.

226
00:23:24,113 --> 00:23:26,490
He never goes out unsupervised.

227
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:27,658
Who?

228
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:35,457
I hate those comic books.

229
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:38,669
They never get the eyes right.

230
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:46,176
Hellboy.

231
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:47,970
He's real.

232
00:23:48,137 --> 00:23:51,557
60 years old by our count.
But he doesn't age like we do.

233
00:23:51,724 --> 00:23:55,102
Think reverse dog years.
He's barely out of his 20s.

234
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:56,687
What's with the hair, Clay?

235
00:23:57,271 --> 00:23:59,023
Finally got them implants, huh?

236
00:24:00,691 --> 00:24:02,192
It'll fill in.

237
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,861
Who's the squirt?

238
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:06,864
Agent Myers is your new liaison.

239
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:11,201
I don't want him.

240
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:14,538
What, you get tired of me, Clay?

241
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:17,041
The candy. Give him the candy.

242
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:19,335
Oh, sir, I...

243
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:21,337
I have these for you.

244
00:24:22,713 --> 00:24:23,881
Father's back?

245
00:24:25,591 --> 00:24:28,636
- He still angry?
- Well, you did break out.

246
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:30,012
I wanted to see her.

247
00:24:30,471 --> 00:24:34,016
- Nobody's business.
- It is. You got yourself on TV again.

248
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,018
Myers, huh?

249
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,729
You got a first name, Myers?

250
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:41,649
Try not to stare.
He hates it when people stare.

251
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:45,235
John. John Myers.

252
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:47,321
Well, John'll do.

253
00:24:47,488 --> 00:24:51,659
- Stare at what?
- His horns. He files them to fit in.

254
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:01,585
What you looking at, John?

255
00:25:03,671 --> 00:25:06,924
Oh, no, no, no. Nothing.
Nothing at all.

256
00:25:07,091 --> 00:25:08,425
<i>Code red.</i>

257
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:09,593
Hey, hey, hey.

258
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,095
<i>Warning. Code red.</i>

259
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:12,638
They're playing our song.

260
00:25:13,055 --> 00:25:16,392
Come on, champ,
let's go fight some monsters.

261
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:24,608
We're here at the Machen Library...

262
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:27,528
...where just hours ago,
an alarm was triggered.

263
00:25:27,695 --> 00:25:30,614
The N.Y.P.D. has yet
to issue a statement.

264
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:34,243
We've got SWAT vans, paramedics.
You name it.

265
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:36,495
And now here comes
a garbage truck.

266
00:25:36,662 --> 00:25:38,664
A large garbage truck.

267
00:25:42,126 --> 00:25:43,752
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue.

268
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,547
One sheet of glass
between them and us.

269
00:25:46,714 --> 00:25:48,507
Story of my life.

270
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:53,137
Outside. I could be outside.

271
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:57,224
You mean, outside with her.

272
00:25:57,391 --> 00:25:59,643
Don't get psychic with me, fella.

273
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,687
Nothing psychic about it.

274
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:03,355
You're easy.

275
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:06,483
How am I gonna get a girl?
I drive around in a garbage truck.

276
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:09,945
Liz left us, Red.

277
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:11,864
Take the hint.

278
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,949
We don't take hints.

279
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,962
Okay, guys,
let's sync up our locators.

280
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:34,511
Seal the doors.
Red and Blue are coming in.

281
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:37,848
1900 hours, an alarm was tripped.

282
00:26:38,015 --> 00:26:41,435
A large entity, type 5, reported.
Very aggressive.

283
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:42,770
Six guards dead.

284
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:44,730
I thought we checked this place.

285
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:46,356
Fakes and reproductions.

286
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:49,359
Apparently, not everything was fake.

287
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:53,572
Father.

288
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:02,623
The entity is still in there.

289
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:07,711
Video surveillance shows
a 16th-century statue was destroyed.

290
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:10,047
St. Dionysius the Areopagite.

291
00:27:10,214 --> 00:27:13,008
- Who wards off demons.
- Exactly.

292
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:17,429
The statue, however, was hollow.

293
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:19,723
A reliquary.

294
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:21,642
A prison.

295
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:25,062
The Vatican deemed its occupant
dangerous enough...

296
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:29,817
...to include it on The List of Avignon,
of which, by the way, we hold a copy.

297
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:32,236
Perfect job for these babies.

298
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:33,987
Made them myself.

299
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:38,617
Holy water, clove leaf, silver
shavings, white oak. The works.

300
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:46,291
Behind this door, a dark entity.

301
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:50,879
Evil, ancient and hungry.

302
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:54,925
Oh, well.
Let me go in and say hi.

303
00:28:24,246 --> 00:28:26,164
<i>You better hit the books,
Brother Blue.</i>

304
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:29,376
<i>We'll definitely need
more info on this one.</i>

305
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:31,712
Hey, no one goes with him? Jesus.

306
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:34,256
No. He likes it that way.

307
00:28:34,423 --> 00:28:37,801
The whole "lonely hero" thing.

308
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:54,693
Hey, Stinky.

309
00:28:57,154 --> 00:28:58,822
Kitchen's closed.

310
00:28:59,448 --> 00:29:00,949
What you having?

311
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:04,620
Six library guards, raw,
plus belts and boots.

312
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:08,957
Man, you're gonna need
some heavy fiber to move that out.

313
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:11,001
<i>Red, I found something.</i>

314
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:14,171
This entity's name is Sammael,
the desolate one.

315
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:16,089
Son of Nergal, brother of...

316
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:31,146
Listen, Sammy...

317
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:35,692
...I'm not a very good shot, but The
Samaritan here uses really big bullets.

318
00:29:44,368 --> 00:29:48,205
So, what do you say we work this out
in a nice, peaceful...

319
00:29:49,623 --> 00:29:51,041
Oh, crap.

320
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,555
That's it for you, Sam.

321
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:10,686
<i>Red, you need to hear
the rest of the information.</i>

322
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:13,105
No, he's taken care of.

323
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:15,232
No, listen to this.

324
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:19,569
"Sammael, the desolate one,
lord of the shadows...

325
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:22,698
<i>...son of Nergal,
hound of resurrection..."</i>

326
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:27,452
See...

327
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:28,912
...I don't like that.

328
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,914
<i>What? Hound of resurrection?</i>

329
00:30:31,915 --> 00:30:34,584
<i>"Harbinger of pestilence.
Seed of destruc..."</i>

330
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:37,087
Cut to the end. How do I kill it?

331
00:30:37,254 --> 00:30:38,630
<i>Doesn't say.</i>

332
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:46,430
Go to the front. Let's go! Move!

333
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:48,223
I'm going around the back.

334
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:12,622
Oh, crap.

335
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:14,583
Child.

336
00:31:16,168 --> 00:31:18,045
All grown up, I see.

337
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:20,964
That voice.

338
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:24,760
It was the first lullaby
you ever heard, my son.

339
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:27,471
I ushered you into this world.

340
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:31,391
I alone know your true calling,
your true name.

341
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:33,477
Name this.

342
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:56,166
- That thing. That thing.
- What do you think you're doing?

343
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:58,877
- What do you think you're doing?
- Helping you. I...

344
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:00,670
Nobody helps me!

345
00:32:00,837 --> 00:32:02,255
It's my job.

346
00:32:06,343 --> 00:32:08,929
You want to help? Here.
Load this.

347
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:14,184
It's a tracking bullet. Crack the pin.

348
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:19,189
Jesus, what's that on your arm?

349
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:20,816
Oh, crap.

350
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:28,198
What the hell is that thing?

351
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:30,283
Let me go ask.

352
00:32:50,512 --> 00:32:53,807
All right, keep coming.
Good. Keep coming.

353
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,855
Why, you little...

354
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:21,042
Wait!

355
00:33:24,462 --> 00:33:26,173
We're heading toward civilians.

356
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:40,061
Crazy costumes, huh?
Trick or treat.

357
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:10,967
Red means stop!

358
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:26,399
- You all right?
- Yeah.

359
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:28,652
Stay here.

360
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:42,916
Sammy, you got a leak.

361
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:52,175
Waiting for me, chunk-face?

362
00:34:57,847 --> 00:34:59,349
What the...?

363
00:35:34,884 --> 00:35:37,053
- I'm on your side.
- Sure.

364
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,352
That's right!

365
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:08,710
Open wide!

366
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:14,424
Son of a...

367
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:20,263
Yuck!

368
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,265
Screw this.

369
00:36:36,654 --> 00:36:38,448
I'm fireproof.

370
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:41,242
You're not.

371
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:50,126
Hey, Myers.

372
00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:52,587
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

373
00:36:52,754 --> 00:36:54,422
<i>How's your arm?</i>

374
00:36:54,589 --> 00:36:57,634
Yeah, my arm's fine.
Where are you?

375
00:36:57,801 --> 00:36:59,803
I just fried Stinky.

376
00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:01,638
Listen...

377
00:37:01,888 --> 00:37:03,431
...tell Father I'll be home...

378
00:37:03,598 --> 00:37:05,016
<i>...but he shouldn't wait up.</i>

379
00:37:05,183 --> 00:37:06,601
No. No, wait, wait.

380
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:08,186
<i>Yeah, I gotta go with you.</i>

381
00:37:08,353 --> 00:37:10,939
- Hey, Myers.
- Yeah?

382
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:14,734
Bye.

383
00:37:17,028 --> 00:37:18,780
Damn it.

384
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:23,993
<i>Sammael, die in peace...</i>

385
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:27,414
<i>...and be reborn again and again.</i>

386
00:38:10,707 --> 00:38:13,042
There's a big, red man down there.

387
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:16,045
That's fine, darling.
Santa's not here for another month.

388
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:18,006
Not Santa.

389
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:19,924
Well, who, then?

390
00:38:30,977 --> 00:38:32,729
I brought beer.

391
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:35,064
Oh, Red, your arm.

392
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:38,735
You better get that looked at.

393
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:47,410
I wanted to see you.

394
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:58,713
Every time the media gets
a look at him, they run to me.

395
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,465
I'm running out of lies, Trevor.

396
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:03,218
- I thought you like being on TV.
- I do.

397
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:07,096
So how many escapes
this year alone? Five.

398
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:09,474
Tom, he's our guest, not a prisoner.

399
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:13,895
Your guest is 6-foot-5, bright red,
has a tail and is government-funded.

400
00:39:14,062 --> 00:39:15,438
I know where to find him.

401
00:39:15,897 --> 00:39:18,566
- I'll get him back.
- Hey, fish stick.

402
00:39:18,858 --> 00:39:20,026
Don't touch anything.

403
00:39:20,193 --> 00:39:22,403
I need to touch it to see.

404
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,698
- See what?
- Past, future.

405
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:29,244
Whatever this object holds.

406
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,537
Is he serious?

407
00:39:30,703 --> 00:39:33,665
Don't worry about fingerprints.
Never had any.

408
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:38,795
Professor, they were here.

409
00:39:42,006 --> 00:39:45,468
Who was here? Nixon? Houdini?

410
00:39:45,635 --> 00:39:47,554
Jimmy Hoffa? Who?

411
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,391
Show me, Abe.
Show me what happened here.

412
00:40:06,823 --> 00:40:08,992
<i>This is east-wing check-in.
We're all clear.</i>

413
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,163
<i>Also, make sure it's all locked up
over there in the annex.</i>

414
00:40:15,456 --> 00:40:16,499
<i>Roger that.</i>

415
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,028
Kroenen!

416
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:47,196
Move.

417
00:41:02,211 --> 00:41:03,379
Move!

418
00:41:04,881 --> 00:41:06,049
There he is!

419
00:41:14,557 --> 00:41:16,392
We'll cover him from here!

420
00:41:18,394 --> 00:41:20,813
All right, don't move! Put that down.

421
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,857
Put down the weapon!

422
00:41:23,232 --> 00:41:24,233
Get them.

423
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,985
Drop the weapon.

424
00:41:28,363 --> 00:41:29,989
On the ground!

425
00:41:34,452 --> 00:41:36,037
Last warning!

426
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:43,670
Take him out!

427
00:42:09,278 --> 00:42:13,700
Now, ready the welcome, my love.

428
00:42:19,163 --> 00:42:24,377
Salt gathered from the tears
of a thousand angels.

429
00:42:24,877 --> 00:42:26,879
Restraining the essence...

430
00:42:27,046 --> 00:42:30,299
...of Sammael, the hellhound.

431
00:42:31,217 --> 00:42:34,595
The seed of destruction.

432
00:42:44,564 --> 00:42:48,151
This I can promise, Sammael.

433
00:42:49,152 --> 00:42:52,280
For each one of you that falls...

434
00:42:52,447 --> 00:42:53,948
...two shall arise.

435
00:43:29,317 --> 00:43:31,652
- Professor.
- I'm all right.

436
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,072
Professor.

437
00:43:38,034 --> 00:43:39,702
You...

438
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,456
You are very sick.

439
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:47,877
I don't want Hellboy to know.

440
00:43:50,004 --> 00:43:53,466
Sixty years ago,
they tried to destroy the world.

441
00:43:53,633 --> 00:43:55,176
They're back.

442
00:43:55,718 --> 00:43:59,305
In my lifetime, they're back...

443
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,391
...to finish the job.

444
00:44:05,478 --> 00:44:07,146
We miss you at the bureau.

445
00:44:07,313 --> 00:44:09,565
Abe's crazier every day.

446
00:44:09,732 --> 00:44:11,984
Father's still mad at me.

447
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:18,032
Come back, Liz.

448
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:20,910
- Come back.
- No. No, H.B.

449
00:44:22,078 --> 00:44:24,330
No, not this time.

450
00:44:26,249 --> 00:44:28,543
I don't like it here...

451
00:44:29,377 --> 00:44:32,922
...but I haven't had an episode
in months.

452
00:44:35,424 --> 00:44:37,718
And you know what?

453
00:44:39,637 --> 00:44:42,014
I'm learning to control it.

454
00:44:42,765 --> 00:44:45,643
I'm learning where it comes from.

455
00:44:46,435 --> 00:44:49,480
For the first time in my life...

456
00:44:51,107 --> 00:44:52,733
...I'm not afraid.

457
00:45:00,408 --> 00:45:03,619
- Looks like your ride is here.
- Have escort stand by.

458
00:45:06,122 --> 00:45:07,748
The Nanny Squad.

459
00:45:10,835 --> 00:45:12,295
Listen, H.B...

460
00:45:12,461 --> 00:45:14,964
...I've got a chance out here.

461
00:45:15,715 --> 00:45:17,925
So if you really care about me...

462
00:45:21,345 --> 00:45:23,973
...you won't come back.

463
00:45:35,318 --> 00:45:36,694
Yeah...

464
00:45:37,236 --> 00:45:38,571
...I gotta go too.

465
00:45:40,323 --> 00:45:42,158
Lots to do.

466
00:45:46,829 --> 00:45:48,205
Hey, Red.

467
00:45:48,623 --> 00:45:51,208
Oh, God. You've lost a lot of blood.

468
00:45:51,375 --> 00:45:52,835
This is nothing.

469
00:45:53,002 --> 00:45:55,588
You know what'll kill me, don't you?

470
00:45:56,547 --> 00:45:59,008
Okay, Red, let's get you home.
Come on.

471
00:46:17,526 --> 00:46:22,657
You were burned
by some organic acid.

472
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:24,492
I'm lucky that way.

473
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,871
- I worry about you.
- Me?

474
00:46:30,957 --> 00:46:32,708
Well...

475
00:46:34,377 --> 00:46:36,379
...I won't be around forever,
you know.

476
00:46:36,545 --> 00:46:37,630
Damn!

477
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:41,008
Could you please be a little careful?

478
00:46:41,258 --> 00:46:42,510
Big baby.

479
00:46:43,094 --> 00:46:45,554
How long was it latched onto you?

480
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:48,391
I don't know. About five seconds.

481
00:46:49,558 --> 00:46:53,062
- Professor, look.
- Is it bad?

482
00:46:53,854 --> 00:46:57,858
Touched you five seconds,
laid three eggs.

483
00:46:58,067 --> 00:47:00,027
Didn't even buy me a drink.

484
00:47:04,907 --> 00:47:09,120
The stinger detaches itself from
the tongue and injects the eggs.

485
00:47:09,286 --> 00:47:13,165
They are very sensitive
to heat and light.

486
00:47:14,208 --> 00:47:19,588
They need a humid,
dark environment to breed.

487
00:47:19,755 --> 00:47:21,757
Did you ever lose track of him?

488
00:47:23,426 --> 00:47:24,927
Well, let's see.

489
00:47:25,094 --> 00:47:29,098
There was that moment when
I had the train on top of my head.

490
00:47:29,265 --> 00:47:30,933
We can't risk it.

491
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:34,395
Tomorrow you'll go back to the tracks
with a group of agents.

492
00:47:34,562 --> 00:47:37,356
Search the whole place
top to bottom.

493
00:47:37,523 --> 00:47:39,734
Find those eggs and destroy them.

494
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,705
"Elizabeth Sherman."

495
00:47:53,247 --> 00:47:55,958
<i>I don't like the term "fire-starter."</i>

496
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,251
<i>I just don't.</i>

497
00:47:57,835 --> 00:48:01,797
<i>And "pyrokinesis" sounds like
some psychosis or something.</i>

498
00:48:01,964 --> 00:48:03,174
<i>I don't know.</i>

499
00:48:03,841 --> 00:48:05,384
<i>Maybe that's right.</i>

500
00:48:05,551 --> 00:48:07,928
<i>Not being able to let go.</i>

501
00:48:08,095 --> 00:48:09,388
<i>It's scary.</i>

502
00:48:09,972 --> 00:48:14,518
<i>I black out after each episode.
Sometimes for hours.</i>

503
00:48:15,186 --> 00:48:17,480
<i>You hear about so and so...</i>

504
00:48:17,646 --> 00:48:20,191
<i>...who just lost control
and just exploded.</i>

505
00:48:20,357 --> 00:48:22,109
<i>Well, they're lucky it isn't true.</i>

506
00:48:22,902 --> 00:48:24,487
<i>With me, it is.</i>

507
00:48:36,665 --> 00:48:41,253
My master is calling
your name now, my girl.

508
00:48:42,004 --> 00:48:44,757
You must return to the child.

509
00:48:45,007 --> 00:48:47,051
So once again...

510
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:49,678
...dream...

511
00:48:50,179 --> 00:48:52,264
...of fire.

512
00:49:09,031 --> 00:49:10,241
Hey, freak!

513
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,327
Get back here, freak!

514
00:49:13,494 --> 00:49:15,037
- Let's get her!
- Get her!

515
00:49:15,704 --> 00:49:17,498
- Get her, guys!
- Watch this!

516
00:49:19,041 --> 00:49:20,167
Freak!

517
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:26,382
Oh, no! Not again.

518
00:49:26,882 --> 00:49:29,218
Oh, no! Somebody!

519
00:49:29,385 --> 00:49:30,761
Help me!

520
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:34,056
Help me, somebody! Help me!

521
00:50:20,477 --> 00:50:23,397
How many buildings
does she have to burn down?

522
00:50:23,564 --> 00:50:25,399
She belongs here.

523
00:50:25,691 --> 00:50:27,026
That's not what she feels.

524
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:30,362
She may never feel it.
It's her choice.

525
00:50:30,529 --> 00:50:31,989
Professor, the girl you're...

526
00:50:33,324 --> 00:50:36,952
Professor,
that girl you're talking about...

527
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:38,537
Hey, Boy Scout...

528
00:50:38,704 --> 00:50:39,705
...think twice.

529
00:50:39,872 --> 00:50:41,874
No, listen, I read her file.

530
00:50:42,875 --> 00:50:44,877
- "Read her file."
- She blames herself...

531
00:50:45,044 --> 00:50:48,797
...for that explosion in Pittsburgh.
Look, I think I can help.

532
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:51,425
I could talk to her.

533
00:50:51,592 --> 00:50:53,427
I think I could bring her back.

534
00:50:53,844 --> 00:50:57,181
Just what was it that landed you
this job pushing "pamcakes," huh?

535
00:50:57,556 --> 00:50:59,058
What was it?

536
00:50:59,225 --> 00:51:02,269
Punctuality?
The way you part your hair?

537
00:51:02,436 --> 00:51:04,438
What is your area of expertise?

538
00:51:07,274 --> 00:51:08,692
<i>He doesn't want me with him.</i>

539
00:51:09,026 --> 00:51:10,194
I know that much.

540
00:51:10,402 --> 00:51:12,655
- You're doing fine.
- No, I'm not.

541
00:51:12,821 --> 00:51:15,032
Look, he respects Clay, not me.

542
00:51:16,825 --> 00:51:18,577
I'm really sorry, okay?

543
00:51:20,704 --> 00:51:22,122
I'm not your guy.

544
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,960
I'm dying, Agent Myers.

545
00:51:27,336 --> 00:51:30,214
Like any father, I worry about him.

546
00:51:32,675 --> 00:51:36,387
In medieval stories,
there is often a young knight...

547
00:51:36,553 --> 00:51:40,140
...who is inexperienced...

548
00:51:41,225 --> 00:51:43,852
- ...but pure of heart.
- Come on.

549
00:51:44,019 --> 00:51:46,188
Look, I am not pure of heart.

550
00:51:46,355 --> 00:51:47,940
Yes, you are.

551
00:51:48,857 --> 00:51:51,527
Rasputin is back for him.

552
00:51:51,735 --> 00:51:53,529
What I ask of you...

553
00:51:53,696 --> 00:51:57,741
...is to have the courage
to stand by him when I am gone.

554
00:51:58,617 --> 00:52:01,203
He was born a demon.
Can't change that.

555
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:03,414
But you will help him...

556
00:52:04,206 --> 00:52:06,041
...in essence...

557
00:52:06,709 --> 00:52:08,252
...to become a man.

558
00:52:23,726 --> 00:52:24,727
Pull that down.

559
00:52:24,893 --> 00:52:26,812
<i>She was making great progress...</i>

560
00:52:26,979 --> 00:52:28,147
...and now this.

561
00:52:28,314 --> 00:52:30,316
We'll be closed for months.

562
00:52:30,482 --> 00:52:32,818
And it put a big dent
in our Thorazine supply.

563
00:52:33,819 --> 00:52:36,405
She's been like this
since it happened.

564
00:52:38,282 --> 00:52:41,910
Are you sure you want to go in?

565
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:51,628
Miss Sherman?

566
00:52:51,795 --> 00:52:54,423
I'm Agent Myers, FBI.

567
00:52:57,926 --> 00:52:59,762
Miss Sherman?

568
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,350
Can I call you Liz?

569
00:53:04,516 --> 00:53:06,935
It's a beautiful name.

570
00:53:07,102 --> 00:53:10,773
Sixty percent of all the women
in the world are named Liz.

571
00:53:11,607 --> 00:53:15,611
Well, it's impressive by my standards.
My name's John.

572
00:53:15,944 --> 00:53:18,447
John T. Myers.

573
00:53:19,073 --> 00:53:21,950
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you
back to the bureau.

574
00:53:22,117 --> 00:53:26,372
No special precautions,
no security escorts.

575
00:53:27,247 --> 00:53:31,377
Just you and me in a taxi
like regular folks.

576
00:53:44,223 --> 00:53:45,724
Over here.

577
00:53:47,184 --> 00:53:49,686
You said those eggs need it
dark and humid?

578
00:53:49,853 --> 00:53:51,814
Well, they hit the jackpot.

579
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:55,317
The subway lines,
they all converge right around here.

580
00:53:55,484 --> 00:53:57,903
Right below us
is the old Vandeveer reservoir.

581
00:53:58,070 --> 00:53:59,863
It was abandoned in the mid-30s.

582
00:54:00,072 --> 00:54:01,657
There's a pulse.

583
00:54:03,992 --> 00:54:07,704
There. A cistern on the other side.

584
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:13,335
Most of the eggs are there.

585
00:54:14,503 --> 00:54:15,838
There's no way in.

586
00:54:17,172 --> 00:54:20,175
We should go back and request
a special permit, type 2...

587
00:54:38,277 --> 00:54:40,112
You guys coming or what?

588
00:55:01,216 --> 00:55:03,343
We lead a charmed life.

589
00:55:18,984 --> 00:55:20,736
Here you are, doctor.

590
00:55:21,236 --> 00:55:23,071
This should cover your tail fin.

591
00:55:23,238 --> 00:55:25,532
Reliquary. Straight from the Vatican.

592
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:31,455
A bone from St. Dionysius.
Looks like a pinkie.

593
00:55:32,247 --> 00:55:34,249
Remind me why I keep doing this.

594
00:55:34,416 --> 00:55:37,085
Rotten eggs
and the safety of mankind.

595
00:56:21,672 --> 00:56:24,341
This doesn't really look
like doll's hair.

596
00:56:24,508 --> 00:56:26,260
Be honest, Red. What do you think?

597
00:56:27,469 --> 00:56:29,304
I'm thinking about doing it myself.

598
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:32,224
Hey, you guys find anything?

599
00:56:32,391 --> 00:56:33,392
<i>No eggs yet, Red.</i>

600
00:56:33,559 --> 00:56:35,352
<i>What, are you on a lunch break?</i>

601
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:36,895
Nothing here.

602
00:56:46,738 --> 00:56:48,532
Red's on the move. I'll cover him.

603
00:56:55,872 --> 00:56:57,332
Damn it, Red.

604
00:58:42,437 --> 00:58:43,438
Hey, it's Abe.

605
00:58:49,069 --> 00:58:51,113
Oh, God.

606
00:58:53,031 --> 00:58:54,533
Bring your toy over here.

607
00:58:56,368 --> 00:58:57,411
Oh, man.

608
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,538
Oh, Jesus.

609
00:59:01,123 --> 00:59:03,291
There's only one. I'll fry him quick.

610
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:05,544
Two. There were two.

611
00:59:33,697 --> 00:59:34,823
Red?

612
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:36,783
Red. Come in, Red.

613
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:40,162
What's your 20? I got no signal.
Where the hell are you?

614
00:59:40,328 --> 00:59:42,664
<i>It's like Swiss cheese in here.</i>

615
00:59:43,331 --> 00:59:45,208
Sit tight, pal, I'm on him.

616
01:00:02,184 --> 01:00:05,020
Sammael, hound of the resurrection.

617
01:00:08,774 --> 01:00:10,692
Didn't I kill you already?

618
01:00:21,244 --> 01:00:23,872
You goddamn monster!

619
01:00:46,186 --> 01:00:47,229
Oh, crap.

620
01:01:02,661 --> 01:01:03,954
It's for you!

621
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,915
You shouldn't hurt people!

622
01:01:27,853 --> 01:01:29,062
You missed.

623
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:51,084
Hey, chunk-face.

624
01:01:52,752 --> 01:01:56,256
You can do better than that,
big monster like you.

625
01:02:47,182 --> 01:02:49,643
My kittens! Please!

626
01:02:49,809 --> 01:02:52,520
Somebody, please, get my kittens!

627
01:02:57,525 --> 01:02:58,985
Second date.

628
01:02:59,861 --> 01:03:01,363
No tongue.

629
01:03:14,042 --> 01:03:16,461
My kittens. Careful with them!

630
01:03:16,628 --> 01:03:18,630
Lady, give me a break!

631
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:40,151
Thank you.

632
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:42,862
My job.

633
01:04:35,582 --> 01:04:39,794
<i>Clay, I'm getting a signal from Abe.
I'm on my way back.</i>

634
01:04:42,797 --> 01:04:45,383
Buddy, don't take another step.

635
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:12,452
Clay.

636
01:05:46,569 --> 01:05:49,614
Man down. I need an ambulance
right away. Do you read me?

637
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:51,449
Hang in there, pal.

638
01:05:51,866 --> 01:05:55,245
Man down.
Do you read? Do you read?

639
01:05:57,705 --> 01:05:59,999
Quarry, Moss, do you read me?

640
01:06:00,542 --> 01:06:03,545
Quarry, Moss, do you read me?
Man down!

641
01:06:14,222 --> 01:06:16,224
He'll make it.

642
01:06:18,268 --> 01:06:20,436
Not everyone was so lucky.

643
01:06:22,021 --> 01:06:24,399
We had two agents die today.

644
01:06:25,066 --> 01:06:27,485
Clay probably won't survive
the night.

645
01:06:27,652 --> 01:06:30,405
- Not now, Manning, please.
- My problem with you:

646
01:06:32,073 --> 01:06:33,575
You're reckless.

647
01:06:33,741 --> 01:06:37,078
These men trusted you
to lead them as a team.

648
01:06:37,245 --> 01:06:39,080
Where were you?

649
01:06:39,956 --> 01:06:41,833
I knew those men
better than you did.

650
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,712
- That makes it all right, then.
- No, it doesn't make it all right.

651
01:06:46,713 --> 01:06:49,257
- But I stopped that thing, didn't I?
- Yes, you did.

652
01:06:49,424 --> 01:06:51,426
It's what you do.
It's why we need you.

653
01:06:51,593 --> 01:06:54,262
You have an insight.
You know monsters.

654
01:06:55,722 --> 01:06:58,016
What are you trying to say?

655
01:06:58,766 --> 01:07:01,311
This whole thing is a farce.

656
01:07:01,769 --> 01:07:03,104
Because in the end...

657
01:07:03,271 --> 01:07:06,774
...after you've killed, after you've
captured every freak out there...

658
01:07:07,734 --> 01:07:09,527
...there's still one left.

659
01:07:10,403 --> 01:07:11,905
You.

660
01:07:16,326 --> 01:07:18,077
Hey, Manning.

661
01:07:18,244 --> 01:07:20,830
I wish I could be
more gracious, but...

662
01:07:27,212 --> 01:07:29,631
Welcome back.

663
01:07:31,257 --> 01:07:33,885
It's only for the weekend,
Professor Broom.

664
01:07:41,142 --> 01:07:44,938
I want that thing locked up,
starting now.

665
01:07:45,104 --> 01:07:46,856
Right now! Do you...?

666
01:07:47,232 --> 01:07:49,150
Now, you hear me?

667
01:07:49,317 --> 01:07:51,236
- Locked up!
- Nothing's changed.

668
01:07:51,444 --> 01:07:52,570
Home sweet home.

669
01:07:52,862 --> 01:07:54,113
Liz?

670
01:07:56,658 --> 01:07:58,326
Liz!

671
01:08:00,370 --> 01:08:03,081
You did it, buddy. You did it!

672
01:08:06,668 --> 01:08:08,461
Myers?

673
01:08:09,003 --> 01:08:10,672
Pop?

674
01:08:19,764 --> 01:08:22,141
I'm gonna put these over here, okay?

675
01:08:22,308 --> 01:08:23,559
One minute. One minute.

676
01:08:27,021 --> 01:08:28,606
Hey, Myers...

677
01:08:28,773 --> 01:08:30,900
...you're a talker.

678
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:34,362
What's a good word,
a solid word, for "need"?

679
01:08:34,529 --> 01:08:35,697
Well...

680
01:08:35,863 --> 01:08:37,865
..."need" is a good, solid word.

681
01:08:38,032 --> 01:08:39,284
Too needy.

682
01:08:39,450 --> 01:08:41,911
Start in, okay?
You got nachos coming.

683
01:08:43,746 --> 01:08:44,872
Nachos.

684
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:46,666
Oh, my God.

685
01:08:46,833 --> 01:08:48,668
Look at them all.

686
01:08:49,377 --> 01:08:51,546
Who had babies?

687
01:08:53,172 --> 01:08:58,136
Liz, there's something I need
for you to hear, and it's...

688
01:08:58,303 --> 01:09:00,805
Will it take long?
Because I'm actually going out.

689
01:09:02,557 --> 01:09:03,558
Out?

690
01:09:05,101 --> 01:09:06,102
"Out" out?

691
01:09:06,644 --> 01:09:10,648
Yeah. Yeah, for a cup of coffee,
but go ahead, read.

692
01:09:10,815 --> 01:09:12,317
Are you going alone?

693
01:09:13,818 --> 01:09:16,154
No, Myers is taking me.

694
01:09:17,155 --> 01:09:19,574
Hey, your chili's getting cold.

695
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:21,200
Not hungry.

696
01:09:23,244 --> 01:09:25,330
Is there something
you'd like me to hear?

697
01:09:25,496 --> 01:09:28,207
- It's just a list. It's not finished.
- Okay.

698
01:09:28,374 --> 01:09:30,293
Well, then, later.

699
01:09:31,085 --> 01:09:32,795
See you.

700
01:09:34,088 --> 01:09:36,215
- Anything else you need?
- Not from you.

701
01:09:37,383 --> 01:09:38,384
Well, good night.

702
01:09:39,594 --> 01:09:40,762
Goodbye.

703
01:09:50,563 --> 01:09:53,733
Subject: Karl Ruprecht Kroenen.

704
01:09:54,067 --> 01:09:56,944
Born in Munich, 1897.

705
01:09:58,029 --> 01:10:00,948
Suffered from
a masochistic compulsion...

706
01:10:01,783 --> 01:10:05,119
...commonly known
as surgical addiction.

707
01:10:08,539 --> 01:10:11,959
Both eyelids surgically removed...

708
01:10:15,213 --> 01:10:17,090
...along with his upper...

709
01:10:18,466 --> 01:10:20,093
...and lower lip.

710
01:10:21,886 --> 01:10:25,890
The blood in his veins
dried up decades ago.

711
01:10:27,642 --> 01:10:30,853
Only dust remains.

712
01:10:34,232 --> 01:10:37,276
What horrible will...

713
01:10:38,111 --> 01:10:41,155
...could keep such a creature
as this alive?

714
01:10:57,422 --> 01:11:00,174
And one of those cookies.
Do you have any doughnuts?

715
01:11:00,341 --> 01:11:02,677
Sorry, pal. How about a bear claw?

716
01:11:03,344 --> 01:11:05,680
No. He's determined, unstoppable.

717
01:11:05,847 --> 01:11:07,849
Some people would call that cocky.

718
01:11:08,015 --> 01:11:10,518
- He's just strong.
- Yeah. That he is.

719
01:11:10,685 --> 01:11:12,186
Hey, I've got yours.

720
01:11:12,937 --> 01:11:17,525
My uncle, he used to say
we like people for their qualities...

721
01:11:17,692 --> 01:11:19,902
...but love them for their defects.

722
01:11:21,946 --> 01:11:23,698
He loves you, you know.

723
01:11:25,992 --> 01:11:27,368
What about you?

724
01:11:29,036 --> 01:11:31,789
I don't know. I grew up with him.

725
01:11:33,624 --> 01:11:36,586
But now every time I see him,
I get confused.

726
01:11:36,752 --> 01:11:39,714
There's hardly a day that goes by
that he's not in my mind.

727
01:11:39,881 --> 01:11:41,048
Even now...

728
01:11:42,216 --> 01:11:44,302
...I feel like he's here.

729
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,305
Hey, wait up.

730
01:11:50,391 --> 01:11:52,768
You like doughnuts? I got two.

731
01:11:53,603 --> 01:11:56,397
- Thanks. That was nice.
- I got a cookie, as well.

732
01:11:56,564 --> 01:11:58,816
- Sugar?
- No. No sugar. Thanks.

733
01:11:58,983 --> 01:12:01,486
No cream and sugar, moron.
She takes it black.

734
01:12:01,903 --> 01:12:04,822
- I got some milk here.
- No. I'm okay. I don't take milk.

735
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:06,866
- You're lucky.
- Told you.

736
01:12:10,703 --> 01:12:12,205
She took his picture.

737
01:12:12,663 --> 01:12:13,831
Damn!

738
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,835
She took his picture.

739
01:12:20,213 --> 01:12:21,881
She took his picture.

740
01:12:24,759 --> 01:12:26,260
She took his picture.

741
01:12:29,555 --> 01:12:30,848
Oh, crap.

742
01:12:40,399 --> 01:12:41,943
It's freezing, isn't it?

743
01:12:42,568 --> 01:12:44,403
Coffee's warming me up.

744
01:12:45,696 --> 01:12:47,448
Well, what do we do now?

745
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:51,035
Newark, New Jersey,
entertainment capital of the world.

746
01:12:51,744 --> 01:12:54,539
- You sound like a game-show host.
- Hi.

747
01:12:54,914 --> 01:12:56,374
Hey.

748
01:12:58,793 --> 01:12:59,835
You're Hellboy.

749
01:13:03,589 --> 01:13:05,550
I'm on a mission.

750
01:13:08,469 --> 01:13:11,806
All right, tell me something about you.
Where do you come from?

751
01:13:11,973 --> 01:13:14,308
I lived with my uncle most of my life.

752
01:13:14,475 --> 01:13:18,104
Then I went to Quantico, went to top
of my class. I'm nothing like...

753
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:19,689
Don't tell anyone, huh?

754
01:13:23,484 --> 01:13:24,569
Attaboy.

755
01:13:41,502 --> 01:13:45,923
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.

756
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:47,842
Moscow.

757
01:13:48,009 --> 01:13:50,803
Who wants us in Moscow?

758
01:14:38,059 --> 01:14:40,728
- My mom baked them.
- She's laughing.

759
01:14:41,604 --> 01:14:44,315
She's sitting on a park bench,
and she's laughing.

760
01:14:44,899 --> 01:14:47,401
That's it. I'm done.

761
01:14:47,818 --> 01:14:49,737
They don't look like spies.

762
01:14:50,571 --> 01:14:52,573
Are you kidding me?

763
01:14:52,907 --> 01:14:54,575
Look at this guy.

764
01:14:54,742 --> 01:14:58,412
Those shady little eyes,
that phony grin.

765
01:14:58,954 --> 01:15:01,415
- Are you going to eat that?
- No.

766
01:15:03,084 --> 01:15:06,212
Hey, he's yawning. He's bored.

767
01:15:06,379 --> 01:15:08,964
Yeah, the old yawning trick.

768
01:15:11,050 --> 01:15:12,635
Watch his arm.

769
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:22,853
First he wants my job,
then he wants my girl.

770
01:15:26,524 --> 01:15:29,777
Hey, we all have a side
that we try to hide.

771
01:15:36,283 --> 01:15:37,868
God...

772
01:15:38,119 --> 01:15:39,745
Hey, what the hell?

773
01:15:39,912 --> 01:15:43,124
Hey! Hey, who threw that?

774
01:15:46,043 --> 01:15:49,088
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

775
01:15:52,133 --> 01:15:53,676
Nice shot.

776
01:15:58,431 --> 01:16:02,476
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.

777
01:16:03,144 --> 01:16:05,813
It's Rasputin's mausoleum.

778
01:16:13,112 --> 01:16:14,822
I see the puppet.

779
01:16:15,614 --> 01:16:17,867
But where is...

780
01:16:18,826 --> 01:16:20,369
...the puppeteer?

781
01:16:20,536 --> 01:16:22,496
Very good, Professor Broom.

782
01:16:24,331 --> 01:16:25,791
It was you.

783
01:16:25,958 --> 01:16:28,419
The scraps of paper...

784
01:16:28,586 --> 01:16:31,380
...Liz's sudden relapse and return.

785
01:16:31,547 --> 01:16:33,466
Bread crumbs on the trail.

786
01:16:33,632 --> 01:16:35,468
Like in a fable.

787
01:16:35,843 --> 01:16:37,845
They both distract him...

788
01:16:38,637 --> 01:16:40,765
...and guide him exactly
where I need him.

789
01:16:40,931 --> 01:16:42,099
Moscow.

790
01:16:42,266 --> 01:16:44,268
His destiny.

791
01:16:45,686 --> 01:16:47,021
And the last clue...

792
01:16:47,188 --> 01:16:50,316
...will be left by
the late Professor Broom.

793
01:16:50,483 --> 01:16:52,193
You raised the child.

794
01:16:52,359 --> 01:16:54,195
Nurtured him.

795
01:16:54,361 --> 01:16:56,489
So in return...

796
01:16:56,906 --> 01:16:58,532
...I will permit you...

797
01:16:58,699 --> 01:17:03,370
...a brief, brief glimpse of the future.

798
01:17:17,968 --> 01:17:20,137
<i>He will open the portal...</i>

799
01:17:20,304 --> 01:17:23,182
<i>...and bring about
the end of the world.</i>

800
01:17:24,391 --> 01:17:27,728
<i>If only you had had him destroyed
60 years ago...</i>

801
01:17:27,895 --> 01:17:30,397
<i>...none of this would have
come to pass.</i>

802
01:17:30,564 --> 01:17:33,943
<i>But then, how could you have known?</i>

803
01:17:34,109 --> 01:17:37,196
<i>Your God chooses to remain silent.</i>

804
01:17:37,905 --> 01:17:40,574
Mine lives within me.

805
01:17:40,741 --> 01:17:43,327
Every time I died and crossed over...

806
01:17:44,245 --> 01:17:48,582
...a little more of the master...

807
01:17:48,749 --> 01:17:51,043
...came back with me.

808
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:55,089
He disclosed to me
the child's true name.

809
01:17:55,923 --> 01:17:57,758
Would you like to know it?

810
01:17:57,925 --> 01:18:01,637
I know what to call him.

811
01:18:03,138 --> 01:18:05,099
I call him...

812
01:18:07,434 --> 01:18:08,686
...Son.

813
01:18:14,275 --> 01:18:16,068
I'm ready.

814
01:18:18,195 --> 01:18:19,488
It'll be quick.

815
01:18:43,888 --> 01:18:47,224
Just go there
and tell her how you feel.

816
01:18:49,476 --> 01:18:50,644
My mom says that...

817
01:18:50,811 --> 01:18:53,731
Look, it's not...
It's not that easy, okay?

818
01:18:56,483 --> 01:18:58,611
Plus, you're 9.

819
01:18:59,111 --> 01:19:01,697
You're not old enough
to be giving me advice.

820
01:19:03,657 --> 01:19:06,327
- All right, stand by.
- Who are those guys?

821
01:19:14,209 --> 01:19:17,922
Liz, I'm sorry. It's Broom.
Let's go. We need to find him.

822
01:19:18,088 --> 01:19:19,965
- No!
- Wait, what happened?

823
01:19:20,132 --> 01:19:21,467
- No!
- It's okay.

824
01:19:21,634 --> 01:19:23,010
No, not him.

825
01:19:23,177 --> 01:19:25,179
- Would you take her?
- Something's wrong.

826
01:21:14,038 --> 01:21:16,957
<i>He hasn't spoken to anybody
in three days.</i>

827
01:21:17,624 --> 01:21:19,293
Not a word.

828
01:21:19,585 --> 01:21:22,087
He won't eat, he won't sleep.

829
01:21:22,671 --> 01:21:24,757
I've never seen him like this.

830
01:21:24,923 --> 01:21:25,924
Never.

831
01:21:26,592 --> 01:21:28,469
Should I stay?

832
01:21:29,094 --> 01:21:31,221
With him, I mean?

833
01:21:33,015 --> 01:21:37,269
Listen, I'm not much
of a problem solver.

834
01:21:38,479 --> 01:21:43,067
Three decades,
I've only completed two sides.

835
01:21:43,233 --> 01:21:44,651
But I do know this much.

836
01:21:44,818 --> 01:21:47,071
If there's trouble...

837
01:21:47,237 --> 01:21:51,158
...all us freaks have is each other.

838
01:21:52,451 --> 01:21:53,994
And I'm stuck here.

839
01:21:54,161 --> 01:21:55,829
So...

840
01:21:55,996 --> 01:21:59,374
...take care of the big monkey for me,
will you?

841
01:22:08,175 --> 01:22:12,221
Volokolamsk Fields, 50 miles from
Moscow, that's where we're going.

842
01:22:12,387 --> 01:22:16,767
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.
That's the only clue we have.

843
01:22:16,934 --> 01:22:19,645
We've collected
and destroyed thousands of eggs...

844
01:22:19,812 --> 01:22:23,774
...but we have no trace of this
Sammael or this Rasputin character.

845
01:22:23,941 --> 01:22:27,486
We leave as soon
as we get clearance and equipment.

846
01:22:27,653 --> 01:22:29,321
Hellboy's coming.

847
01:22:29,488 --> 01:22:32,533
I'm not pleased about that,
but I'll be in charge this time.

848
01:22:32,699 --> 01:22:37,204
We either wrap this up or I'm closing
this freak show for good.

849
01:22:47,381 --> 01:22:48,715
Hi.

850
01:22:49,049 --> 01:22:50,092
Hi.

851
01:22:54,930 --> 01:22:56,598
I'll...

852
01:22:56,890 --> 01:22:58,725
...come to Moscow...

853
01:22:58,892 --> 01:23:01,228
...if you're still going.

854
01:23:01,687 --> 01:23:02,855
I am.

855
01:23:03,355 --> 01:23:05,732
But I have something to say.

856
01:23:08,235 --> 01:23:10,612
I understand
what you don't like about me.

857
01:23:10,779 --> 01:23:12,072
I do.

858
01:23:13,407 --> 01:23:14,908
What I am...

859
01:23:16,451 --> 01:23:19,037
...makes you feel
a little out of place...

860
01:23:19,496 --> 01:23:20,497
...out there.

861
01:23:20,664 --> 01:23:22,166
- Red, I don't...
- Listen.

862
01:23:24,751 --> 01:23:26,211
I'm not like Myers.

863
01:23:27,421 --> 01:23:29,840
He makes you feel like you belong...

864
01:23:30,591 --> 01:23:32,217
...which is good, really.

865
01:23:39,099 --> 01:23:41,685
I wish I could do something about this.

866
01:23:43,687 --> 01:23:45,564
I can't.

867
01:23:47,691 --> 01:23:50,068
I can promise you two things:

868
01:23:51,195 --> 01:23:53,697
One, I'll always look this good.

869
01:23:58,577 --> 01:24:00,704
And two...

870
01:24:02,206 --> 01:24:04,124
...I'll never give up on you.

871
01:24:06,919 --> 01:24:08,045
Ever.

872
01:24:10,172 --> 01:24:11,757
I like that.

873
01:24:21,225 --> 01:24:24,394
One falls, two shall arise. Sammael.

874
01:24:26,271 --> 01:24:28,899
We'll have to nail them all at once,
and the eggs.

875
01:24:29,066 --> 01:24:31,109
And when we do, no mumbo jumbo.

876
01:24:32,486 --> 01:24:35,322
Double-core Vulcan-65 grenades.

877
01:24:35,489 --> 01:24:38,825
We've installed a handy little timer.
You set it, you walk away.

878
01:24:38,992 --> 01:24:40,911
Cable pulls the safety pins.

879
01:24:41,245 --> 01:24:42,246
Kaboom.

880
01:24:42,412 --> 01:24:44,498
Easy to clean, easy to use.

881
01:24:51,296 --> 01:24:54,508
Sparky to Big Red.
Do you read me? Come in.

882
01:24:57,344 --> 01:24:58,679
"Sparky"?

883
01:24:58,845 --> 01:25:01,139
<i>Who came up with that? Myers?</i>

884
01:25:01,431 --> 01:25:04,476
<i>Yeah, we're leaving the main road,
so hang on.</i>

885
01:25:04,643 --> 01:25:06,687
This better be the place or I'll puke.

886
01:25:13,944 --> 01:25:15,529
You better come out and see.

887
01:25:28,208 --> 01:25:31,628
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.

888
01:25:41,346 --> 01:25:45,517
Forget it. We're never gonna find
Rasputin's mausoleum.

889
01:25:45,684 --> 01:25:49,146
Now, what we do here
is we make up a grid.

890
01:25:49,313 --> 01:25:54,401
We go in by quadrants.
Maybe satellite photography.

891
01:25:54,568 --> 01:25:56,653
Let me ask for directions.

892
01:25:59,281 --> 01:26:00,741
What'd he say?

893
01:26:12,085 --> 01:26:15,505
Come on, baby, find me a talker.

894
01:26:34,107 --> 01:26:35,275
Hi there.

895
01:26:55,921 --> 01:26:57,172
Come on.

896
01:26:58,298 --> 01:26:59,424
Come on.

897
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:01,551
Come on.

898
01:27:05,138 --> 01:27:06,848
What do you want?

899
01:27:07,766 --> 01:27:09,559
This is ridiculous.

900
01:27:11,686 --> 01:27:13,230
I run this show, not him.

901
01:27:13,397 --> 01:27:15,148
This guy's nothing but trouble.

902
01:27:16,149 --> 01:27:18,235
Anybody got a PowerBar?

903
01:27:18,985 --> 01:27:21,405
Hey, there he is.

904
01:27:22,823 --> 01:27:25,242
Sixty feet further, comrades.

905
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:27,786
And three rows in.

906
01:27:28,495 --> 01:27:30,664
What the hell is that on his back?

907
01:27:31,415 --> 01:27:34,167
This here is Ivan Klimentovich.

908
01:27:34,334 --> 01:27:36,002
Say "hi," Ivan.

909
01:27:36,294 --> 01:27:38,713
Go that way, Red Monkey!

910
01:27:38,922 --> 01:27:39,923
Gotcha.

911
01:27:52,352 --> 01:27:55,188
Ivan says there's a whole network
of tunnels down here.

912
01:27:55,355 --> 01:27:56,690
Goes on for miles.

913
01:28:01,778 --> 01:28:04,322
Stay close, everybody.

914
01:28:04,865 --> 01:28:06,533
You better be right about this.

915
01:28:15,292 --> 01:28:17,794
We'll be all right as long as
we don't separate.

916
01:28:35,854 --> 01:28:37,856
Hey, Sparky.

917
01:28:38,023 --> 01:28:41,651
Tell everyone to turn their locator
belts on. Anybody sees anything...

918
01:28:41,818 --> 01:28:43,028
I'll say "Marco."

919
01:28:43,195 --> 01:28:44,237
Polo.

920
01:28:44,654 --> 01:28:47,991
- Are you sure about this?
<i>- On a scale of one to 10: two.</i>

921
01:28:48,575 --> 01:28:51,745
Don't worry, Boy Scout,
she'll take care of you.

922
01:28:51,912 --> 01:28:53,580
<i>She's a tough one.</i>

923
01:28:57,250 --> 01:28:58,293
Come on.

924
01:29:09,179 --> 01:29:11,932
Ask your buddy
how far this thing goes.

925
01:29:27,822 --> 01:29:29,741
How you doing up there, Ivan?

926
01:29:30,116 --> 01:29:33,495
If I had legs I'd kick your ass!

927
01:29:34,246 --> 01:29:37,290
Would you mind holding this guy
for a while? He is so negative.

928
01:29:52,556 --> 01:29:53,890
What the hell is that?

929
01:30:02,357 --> 01:30:03,900
Something big.

930
01:30:04,067 --> 01:30:05,819
- Lime, come with me.
- Right.

931
01:30:05,986 --> 01:30:09,239
No, no, no. Stay put!

932
01:30:11,783 --> 01:30:13,451
Stop!

933
01:30:14,119 --> 01:30:15,912
You listen to me.

934
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:17,163
Listen to me!

935
01:30:18,206 --> 01:30:19,249
I'm in charge.

936
01:30:19,416 --> 01:30:22,335
We're gonna go back.
You can take that door apart.

937
01:30:22,502 --> 01:30:26,131
Whatever it is, it's coming for us.
Now, we gotta move forward!

938
01:30:26,298 --> 01:30:27,632
Lime, let's go!

939
01:30:27,799 --> 01:30:30,468
Stay put!

940
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:36,099
And you! I am not afraid of you!

941
01:30:36,266 --> 01:30:39,019
I'm in charge! We go back!

942
01:30:42,230 --> 01:30:47,027
I was better off dead!

943
01:31:11,509 --> 01:31:12,677
Oh, crap.

944
01:31:46,878 --> 01:31:48,713
Music.

945
01:32:31,548 --> 01:32:32,590
Really went deep.

946
01:32:39,097 --> 01:32:40,807
Hey, what's wrong with you?!

947
01:33:04,456 --> 01:33:06,332
You killed my father.

948
01:33:06,499 --> 01:33:07,709
Your ass is mine.

949
01:33:19,846 --> 01:33:22,307
What are you laughing at,
you Nazi son of a...?

950
01:33:48,208 --> 01:33:50,043
Don't even think about it.

951
01:34:11,189 --> 01:34:13,983
That's all for you, pinhead.

952
01:34:23,368 --> 01:34:24,994
What are you doing?

953
01:34:25,161 --> 01:34:26,746
- What are you doing?
- Having a...

954
01:34:26,913 --> 01:34:28,623
You never light a cigar that way.

955
01:34:28,790 --> 01:34:30,250
You use a wooden match.

956
01:34:32,627 --> 01:34:34,921
Preserves the flavor. You see?

957
01:34:44,138 --> 01:34:45,723
Thank you.

958
01:34:45,890 --> 01:34:47,433
Thank you.

959
01:34:53,982 --> 01:34:57,026
So he thinks you and I...

960
01:34:58,444 --> 01:35:00,238
That's why he's mad at me.

961
01:35:05,451 --> 01:35:08,580
But it's not true, right?

962
01:35:10,373 --> 01:35:11,416
What?

963
01:35:11,583 --> 01:35:14,794
Well, that, you know,
you feel that way about me.

964
01:35:15,169 --> 01:35:18,423
You want to know that here? Now?

965
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:24,220
Yeah.

966
01:35:26,306 --> 01:35:29,434
Red, white, whatever.
Guys are all the same.

967
01:35:32,395 --> 01:35:33,438
Hey, wait up.

968
01:35:34,606 --> 01:35:36,357
<i>Have you found them yet?</i>

969
01:35:36,524 --> 01:35:39,485
<i>I got them right below me.
It's a matter of minutes.</i>

970
01:35:39,652 --> 01:35:41,321
Okay, good.

971
01:35:42,989 --> 01:35:47,535
Could you hurry up?
Because it's a little spooky in here.

972
01:35:48,328 --> 01:35:50,330
Liz, wait.

973
01:35:53,374 --> 01:35:55,627
Oh, my God.

974
01:35:56,419 --> 01:35:59,464
Let's back out real slow.

975
01:36:16,773 --> 01:36:19,150
Myers, ready your grenades.

976
01:36:20,693 --> 01:36:23,363
Marco. Marco. Marco.

977
01:36:23,529 --> 01:36:26,199
Get your big, red butt over here.

978
01:36:32,497 --> 01:36:33,748
I'm coming for you, kid!

979
01:37:32,765 --> 01:37:34,976
No piggybacks!

980
01:37:39,939 --> 01:37:41,774
Get off me, you...

981
01:37:45,319 --> 01:37:46,362
Liz, no!

982
01:37:46,529 --> 01:37:49,365
They're gonna kill him!
Do something!

983
01:37:49,532 --> 01:37:50,950
What do you want me to do?

984
01:37:51,117 --> 01:37:52,160
- Hit me.
- What?

985
01:37:52,952 --> 01:37:54,328
Hit me.

986
01:37:56,247 --> 01:37:57,248
Now!

987
01:38:07,008 --> 01:38:09,260
You should be running.

988
01:39:19,372 --> 01:39:21,207
They are all here.

989
01:39:21,666 --> 01:39:23,209
All of them.

990
01:39:23,709 --> 01:39:26,504
Just the way it was promised.

991
01:39:30,216 --> 01:39:31,676
This one's awake.

992
01:39:36,639 --> 01:39:39,142
Thank you for this.

993
01:40:16,637 --> 01:40:18,472
"And I looked...

994
01:40:19,599 --> 01:40:21,225
...and beheld an angel.

995
01:40:22,351 --> 01:40:27,356
And in his right hand,
the key to the bottomless pit."

996
01:40:30,109 --> 01:40:35,031
These were the words I heard
as a peasant boy in Tobolsk.

997
01:40:35,198 --> 01:40:37,200
And now, the door.

998
01:40:37,783 --> 01:40:40,036
Sent by the Ogdru Jahad...

999
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:45,917
...so that they might at long last
enter our world.

1000
01:40:46,083 --> 01:40:50,087
You are the key,
the right hand of doom.

1001
01:40:51,047 --> 01:40:52,715
Your stone hand.

1002
01:40:52,882 --> 01:40:55,259
What did you think it was made for?

1003
01:40:57,261 --> 01:40:58,638
Open the locks.

1004
01:40:58,804 --> 01:41:00,473
Don't do it, Red! Don't do it!

1005
01:41:03,309 --> 01:41:04,560
Silence.

1006
01:41:07,271 --> 01:41:09,815
Imagine it.

1007
01:41:09,982 --> 01:41:12,068
An Eden...

1008
01:41:12,235 --> 01:41:13,778
...for you and her.

1009
01:41:13,945 --> 01:41:15,446
No.

1010
01:41:15,947 --> 01:41:17,531
No?

1011
01:41:19,367 --> 01:41:21,452
In exchange for her soul, then?

1012
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,168
Open the door.

1013
01:41:30,836 --> 01:41:32,463
No.

1014
01:41:33,256 --> 01:41:35,591
As you wish.

1015
01:41:37,093 --> 01:41:39,011
No!

1016
01:41:58,197 --> 01:41:59,532
Liz!

1017
01:42:08,291 --> 01:42:11,294
Her soul awaits on the other side.

1018
01:42:11,627 --> 01:42:13,587
If you want her back...

1019
01:42:13,754 --> 01:42:16,382
...open the door and claim her.

1020
01:42:20,553 --> 01:42:25,182
Your true name is inscribed
around the locks that hold you.

1021
01:42:25,349 --> 01:42:26,851
You cannot break them...

1022
01:42:27,018 --> 01:42:29,562
...no matter how strong you are.

1023
01:42:29,729 --> 01:42:31,731
The eclipse has begun.

1024
01:42:34,942 --> 01:42:36,777
Your true name...

1025
01:42:37,903 --> 01:42:39,572
...say it!

1026
01:42:46,537 --> 01:42:47,580
Become the key.

1027
01:42:56,714 --> 01:42:58,716
For her.

1028
01:43:00,092 --> 01:43:03,054
Anung un Rama.

1029
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:04,847
Repeat it.

1030
01:43:05,014 --> 01:43:07,600
Anung un Rama.

1031
01:45:32,953 --> 01:45:35,247
Open the final lock.

1032
01:45:35,915 --> 01:45:38,626
Remember who you are!

1033
01:45:58,938 --> 01:46:02,107
Believe me, I have lived
long enough to know...

1034
01:46:02,274 --> 01:46:04,735
...not a tear will be shed
for this world!

1035
01:46:04,902 --> 01:46:06,445
You have a choice.

1036
01:46:06,612 --> 01:46:09,114
Your father gave you that.

1037
01:46:09,281 --> 01:46:10,616
No, you don't!

1038
01:46:10,783 --> 01:46:12,117
Open it!

1039
01:46:14,787 --> 01:46:16,413
Do it!

1040
01:46:40,563 --> 01:46:42,314
What have you done?

1041
01:46:44,441 --> 01:46:46,068
I chose.

1042
01:46:59,164 --> 01:47:01,834
You will never fulfill your destiny.

1043
01:47:02,001 --> 01:47:05,963
You will never understand
the power inside you.

1044
01:47:06,130 --> 01:47:09,008
I'll just have to find a way
to live with that.

1045
01:47:13,596 --> 01:47:15,055
Child.

1046
01:47:15,222 --> 01:47:16,849
Look what you've done.

1047
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:19,810
You've killed me...

1048
01:47:20,436 --> 01:47:22,313
...an insignificant man.

1049
01:47:22,479 --> 01:47:24,648
But you have brought forth...

1050
01:47:25,566 --> 01:47:27,526
...a god.

1051
01:47:35,826 --> 01:47:37,870
Myers, let's go.

1052
01:47:56,597 --> 01:47:59,516
Hell will hold no surprises for us.

1053
01:48:13,238 --> 01:48:15,240
I took a grenade belt.

1054
01:48:17,034 --> 01:48:19,161
The damn thing's broken.

1055
01:48:24,041 --> 01:48:26,210
Keep her safe, will you?

1056
01:48:26,377 --> 01:48:28,879
Whatever happens,
don't leave her alone.

1057
01:48:29,505 --> 01:48:30,589
I won't.

1058
01:48:38,597 --> 01:48:40,432
You're okay, Myers.

1059
01:48:41,308 --> 01:48:42,768
Stick around.

1060
01:48:43,435 --> 01:48:45,187
Hey, Red.

1061
01:48:48,607 --> 01:48:50,025
Just pull the cable.

1062
01:48:50,192 --> 01:48:51,610
I didn't get you anything.

1063
01:48:53,529 --> 01:48:56,699
Are you going to be okay alone?

1064
01:48:59,785 --> 01:49:01,453
How big can it be?

1065
01:49:09,211 --> 01:49:10,379
Damn!

1066
01:49:27,980 --> 01:49:29,064
Damn.

1067
01:50:18,363 --> 01:50:19,990
Oh, this is gonna hurt.

1068
01:50:49,728 --> 01:50:51,897
Gonna be sore in the morning.

1069
01:51:11,708 --> 01:51:13,418
She's got no pulse.

1070
01:51:14,586 --> 01:51:16,255
She's not breathing.

1071
01:51:27,182 --> 01:51:28,600
Liz?

1072
01:51:28,934 --> 01:51:31,228
I was so foolish.

1073
01:52:03,260 --> 01:52:04,553
Red.

1074
01:52:11,810 --> 01:52:13,478
In the dark...

1075
01:52:17,065 --> 01:52:19,151
...I heard your voice.

1076
01:52:23,989 --> 01:52:25,741
What did you say?

1077
01:52:27,826 --> 01:52:29,411
I said, "Hey...

1078
01:52:30,329 --> 01:52:32,539
...you on the other side...

1079
01:52:34,374 --> 01:52:36,043
...let her go.

1080
01:52:37,878 --> 01:52:39,421
Because for...

1081
01:52:46,345 --> 01:52:48,680
For her I'll cross over.

1082
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:54,770
And then you'll be sorry."

1083
01:53:15,248 --> 01:53:17,876
<i>What makes a man a man?</i>

1084
01:53:18,168 --> 01:53:20,837
<i>A friend of mine once wondered.</i>

1085
01:53:21,463 --> 01:53:25,550
<i>Is it his origins?
The way he comes to life?</i>

1086
01:53:26,009 --> 01:53:27,844
<i>I don't think so.</i>

1087
01:53:28,011 --> 01:53:29,930
<i>It's the choices he makes.</i>

1088
01:53:30,097 --> 01:53:32,391
<i>Not how he starts things...</i>

1089
01:53:32,557 --> 01:53:35,727
<i>...but how he decides to end them.</i>

1090
01:55:43,605 --> 01:55:46,691
Hey, guys? I'm still here.

1091
01:55:49,861 --> 01:55:51,196
Hello?
