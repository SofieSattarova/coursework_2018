1
00:00:48,857 --> 00:00:51,318
Rachel, let me see.

2
00:00:57,407 --> 00:01:00,535
- Can I see?
- Finders keepers. And I found it.

3
00:01:00,702 --> 00:01:02,245
In my garden.

4
00:01:03,955 --> 00:01:05,790
Finders keepers.

5
00:01:12,756 --> 00:01:14,257
Bruce?

6
00:01:19,262 --> 00:01:20,972
Bruce?

7
00:01:23,308 --> 00:01:25,769
Mom! Mr. Alfred!

8
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,877
Did you have dream?

9
00:01:51,336 --> 00:01:53,213
Nightmare.

10
00:01:57,592 --> 00:01:59,052
Worse than this place?

11
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,034
They are going to fight you.

12
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,036
- Again?
- Until they kill you.

13
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,040
Can they kill me before breakfast?

14
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:34,254
You are in hell, little man.

15
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:40,343
And I am the devil.

16
00:02:43,722 --> 00:02:45,181
You're not the devil.

17
00:02:45,348 --> 00:02:46,725
You're practice.

18
00:03:30,185 --> 00:03:31,478
Solitary.

19
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,563
- Why?
- For protection.

20
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,608
- I don't need protection.
- Protection for them.

21
00:03:40,278 --> 00:03:42,280
Get in.

22
00:03:46,242 --> 00:03:48,286
Are you so desperate
to fight criminals...

23
00:03:48,453 --> 00:03:51,122
...that you lock yourself in
to take them on one at a time?

24
00:03:52,374 --> 00:03:56,294
Actually, there were seven of them.

25
00:03:56,461 --> 00:03:58,755
I counted six, Mr. Wayne.

26
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:03,760
How do you know my name?

27
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:06,972
The world is too small for someone
like Bruce Wayne to disappear...

28
00:04:07,138 --> 00:04:09,474
...no matter how deep
he chooses to sink.

29
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:10,809
Who are you?

30
00:04:10,976 --> 00:04:14,145
My name is merely Ducard,
but I speak for Ra's al Ghul...

31
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:17,941
...a man greatly feared
by the criminal underworld.

32
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:19,693
A man who can offer you a path.

33
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,113
What makes you think I need a path?

34
00:04:23,488 --> 00:04:26,116
Someone like you
is only here by choice.

35
00:04:26,283 --> 00:04:28,660
You have been exploring
the criminal fraternity...

36
00:04:28,827 --> 00:04:31,288
...but whatever
your original intentions...

37
00:04:31,997 --> 00:04:35,333
...you have become truly lost.

38
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:40,672
And what path can Ra's al Ghul offer?

39
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:44,843
The path of a man
who shares his hatred of evil...

40
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,221
...and wishes to serve true justice.

41
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,807
The path of the League of Shadows.

42
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,187
- You're vigilantes.
- No, no, no.

43
00:04:56,354 --> 00:05:00,525
A vigilante is just a man lost in
the scramble for his own gratification.

44
00:05:00,692 --> 00:05:04,362
He can be destroyed or locked up.

45
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:10,535
But if you make yourself more
than just a man...

46
00:05:10,702 --> 00:05:13,705
...if you devote yourself to an ideal...

47
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:16,374
...and if they can't stop you...

48
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,210
...then you become
something else entirely.

49
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,422
Which is?

50
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,884
Legend, Mr. Wayne.

51
00:05:27,218 --> 00:05:28,845
Tomorrow, you will be released.

52
00:05:29,012 --> 00:05:32,390
If you are bored of brawling with thieves
and want to achieve something...

53
00:05:32,557 --> 00:05:36,061
...there is a rare blue flower
that grows on the eastern slopes.

54
00:05:36,227 --> 00:05:37,896
Pick one of these flowers.

55
00:05:38,063 --> 00:05:41,024
If you can carry it
to the top of the mountain...

56
00:05:41,191 --> 00:05:44,110
...you may find what you were
looking for in the first place.

57
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:47,030
And what was I looking for?

58
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,700
Only you can know that.

59
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:01,479
You turn back. You go back.

60
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,091
Ra's al Ghul?

61
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:22,894
Wait.

62
00:08:25,897 --> 00:08:27,190
What are you seeking?

63
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,110
I seek...

64
00:08:31,653 --> 00:08:33,905
...the means to fight injustice.

65
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:36,408
To turn fear...

66
00:08:36,741 --> 00:08:39,577
...against those
who prey on the fearful.

67
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:04,352
To manipulate the fears in others...

68
00:09:05,186 --> 00:09:08,607
...you must first master your own.

69
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,942
Are you ready to begin?

70
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,446
I can... I can barely stand.

71
00:09:14,613 --> 00:09:16,948
Death does not wait
for you to be ready!

72
00:09:17,115 --> 00:09:20,285
Death is not considerate or fair!

73
00:09:20,785 --> 00:09:25,415
And make no mistake,
here you face death.

74
00:09:29,294 --> 00:09:30,629
Tiger.

75
00:09:32,255 --> 00:09:34,049
Jujitsu.

76
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:37,302
Panther.

77
00:09:40,805 --> 00:09:43,141
You're skilled. But this is not a dance.

78
00:09:48,605 --> 00:09:50,148
And you are afraid.

79
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:54,986
But not of me.

80
00:09:58,448 --> 00:10:00,951
Tell us, Mr. Wayne...

81
00:10:05,455 --> 00:10:08,625
...what do you fear?

82
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,177
Bruce?

83
00:10:21,846 --> 00:10:24,349
It's okay. It's okay.

84
00:10:24,516 --> 00:10:26,017
You'll be okay.

85
00:10:26,268 --> 00:10:28,561
Will we be needing an ambulance,
Master Wayne?

86
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,731
No, I'll set the bone
and take him for an x-ray later.

87
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:33,149
Very good, sir.

88
00:10:33,608 --> 00:10:37,320
- I'm very sorry, sir. I've told...
- Don't worry. It's fine.

89
00:10:39,614 --> 00:10:41,574
Took quite a fall, didn't we,
Master Bruce?

90
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,034
And why do we fall, Bruce?

91
00:10:43,368 --> 00:10:46,454
So we can learn to pick ourselves up.

92
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,086
Just a little fall.
It's just a small fracture.

93
00:11:02,053 --> 00:11:03,888
The bats again?

94
00:11:07,058 --> 00:11:09,185
You know why they attacked you,
don't you?

95
00:11:09,686 --> 00:11:12,731
- They were afraid of you.
- Afraid of me?

96
00:11:12,897 --> 00:11:14,899
All creatures feel fear.

97
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:16,401
Even the scary ones?

98
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:18,445
Especially the scary ones.

99
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,614
I got something to show you.

100
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:28,246
- You think your mother will like them?
- Yeah.

101
00:11:28,913 --> 00:11:31,082
- I think it's time to get up.
- Maybe.

102
00:11:31,249 --> 00:11:32,876
No going back to bed.

103
00:11:36,087 --> 00:11:38,214
Did you build this train, Dad?

104
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:43,094
Gotham's been good to our family,
but the city's been suffering.

105
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:46,765
People less fortunate than us
have been enduring very hard times.

106
00:11:46,932 --> 00:11:50,894
So we built a new, cheap, public
transportation system to unite the city.

107
00:11:51,061 --> 00:11:52,771
And at the center...

108
00:11:52,938 --> 00:11:54,773
...Wayne Tower.

109
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,817
- Is that where you work?
- No, I work at the hospital.

110
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:01,196
I leave the running of our company
to much better men.

111
00:12:01,363 --> 00:12:03,239
- Better?
- Well...

112
00:12:03,406 --> 00:12:05,659
...more interested men.

113
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,466
Can we go?

114
00:13:05,844 --> 00:13:07,345
Please.

115
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:09,973
Okay. Let's go.

116
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,068
- What's wrong, Bruce?
- No, no. It was me.

117
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,362
I just needed some fresh air.

118
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:27,699
A little bit of opera goes a long way.
Right, Bruce?

119
00:13:30,327 --> 00:13:33,038
Come on. Let's go.

120
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:40,253
Wallets, jewelry. Come on, fast.

121
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,796
- That's fine.
- Fast.

122
00:13:41,963 --> 00:13:43,548
Take it easy.

123
00:13:44,215 --> 00:13:45,759
Take it easy.

124
00:13:46,551 --> 00:13:48,011
Here you go.

125
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:53,600
It's fine. It's fine.

126
00:13:54,476 --> 00:13:57,604
Now just take it and go.

127
00:13:57,771 --> 00:13:59,564
- I said, jewelry.
- Hey...

128
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:02,943
Thomas!

129
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,577
Bruce.

130
00:14:15,205 --> 00:14:16,581
It's okay.

131
00:14:19,751 --> 00:14:21,461
Don't be afraid.

132
00:14:53,285 --> 00:14:55,078
Is this your father's?

133
00:14:56,621 --> 00:14:58,748
It's okay.

134
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,584
Come here.

135
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:06,506
There you go.

136
00:15:09,634 --> 00:15:11,636
It's okay.

137
00:15:13,388 --> 00:15:15,307
It's okay.

138
00:15:19,311 --> 00:15:20,812
Gordon.

139
00:15:28,903 --> 00:15:30,488
Hey.

140
00:15:31,114 --> 00:15:32,324
Good news.

141
00:15:33,783 --> 00:15:35,660
We got him, son.

142
00:15:56,306 --> 00:15:58,183
You're in excellent hands.

143
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,018
We'll be watching the empire.

144
00:16:00,185 --> 00:16:03,188
When you grow up,
it'll be waiting for you.

145
00:16:19,204 --> 00:16:22,332
I thought I might prepare
a little supper.

146
00:16:27,504 --> 00:16:29,589
- Very well.
- Alfred?

147
00:16:33,551 --> 00:16:35,553
- Yes, Master Bruce?
- It was my fault, Alfred.

148
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,389
- I made them leave the theater.
- No.

149
00:16:37,555 --> 00:16:40,600
- lf I hadn't gotten scared...
- It was nothing that you did.

150
00:16:41,726 --> 00:16:45,063
It was him, and him alone.

151
00:16:45,563 --> 00:16:47,065
Do you understand?

152
00:16:50,193 --> 00:16:53,238
I miss them, Alfred.
I miss them so much.

153
00:16:53,405 --> 00:16:55,407
So do I, Master Bruce.

154
00:16:57,826 --> 00:16:59,077
So do I.

155
00:17:01,204 --> 00:17:04,165
And do you still feel responsible
for your parents' death?

156
00:17:04,332 --> 00:17:06,459
My anger outweighs my guilt.

157
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,586
Come.

158
00:17:13,258 --> 00:17:15,969
You have learned to bury
your guilt with anger.

159
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:19,180
I will teach you to confront it
and to face the truth.

160
00:17:21,683 --> 00:17:26,646
You know how to fight six men.
We can teach you how to engage 600.

161
00:17:27,897 --> 00:17:29,774
You know how to disappear.

162
00:17:29,941 --> 00:17:32,152
We can teach you
to become truly invisible.

163
00:17:33,778 --> 00:17:35,488
Invisible?

164
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:44,122
The ninja understands that invisibility
is a matter of patience and agility.

165
00:17:57,093 --> 00:17:58,803
Always mind your surroundings.

166
00:18:01,973 --> 00:18:04,184
Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.

167
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,938
- As weapons?
- Or distractions.

168
00:18:08,104 --> 00:18:10,440
Theatricality and deception
are powerful agents.

169
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:13,944
You must become more than just a man
in the mind of your opponent.

170
00:18:16,237 --> 00:18:18,365
- Who is he?
- He was a farmer.

171
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:21,785
Then he tried to take his neighbor's land
and became a murderer.

172
00:18:21,952 --> 00:18:24,245
- Now he is a prisoner.
- What'll happen to him?

173
00:18:24,412 --> 00:18:26,831
Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated.

174
00:18:26,998 --> 00:18:30,961
Criminals thrive on the indulgence
of society's understanding.

175
00:18:35,006 --> 00:18:37,842
Your parents' death
was not your fault.

176
00:18:46,184 --> 00:18:47,435
It was your father's.

177
00:19:08,331 --> 00:19:11,167
Anger does not change the fact
that your father failed to act.

178
00:19:11,334 --> 00:19:13,545
- The man had a gun.
- Would that stop you?

179
00:19:14,337 --> 00:19:15,547
I've had training.

180
00:19:15,714 --> 00:19:17,549
The training is nothing!

181
00:19:17,716 --> 00:19:19,384
Will is everything!

182
00:19:25,181 --> 00:19:27,017
The will to act.

183
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,028
Yield.

184
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,738
You haven't beaten me.

185
00:19:39,904 --> 00:19:42,616
You have sacrificed sure footing
for a killing stroke.

186
00:19:50,248 --> 00:19:52,042
Rub your chest.

187
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:55,420
Your arms will
take care of themselves.

188
00:19:58,089 --> 00:19:59,716
You are stronger than your father.

189
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,010
You didn't know my father.

190
00:20:02,177 --> 00:20:04,471
But I know the rage that drives you.

191
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:06,932
That impossible anger
strangling the grief...

192
00:20:07,098 --> 00:20:09,768
...until the memory
of your loved one is just...

193
00:20:09,935 --> 00:20:11,937
...poison in your veins.

194
00:20:12,103 --> 00:20:16,566
And one day, you catch yourself wishing
the person you loved had never existed...

195
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:20,445
...so you'd be spared your pain.

196
00:20:23,448 --> 00:20:26,826
I wasn't always here in the mountains.

197
00:20:28,453 --> 00:20:30,497
Once, I had a wife.

198
00:20:31,456 --> 00:20:33,375
My great love.

199
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:36,670
She was taken from me.

200
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:40,048
Like you, I was forced to learn
there are those without decency...

201
00:20:40,215 --> 00:20:43,510
...who must be fought
without hesitation, without pity.

202
00:20:45,303 --> 00:20:47,639
Your anger gives you great power.

203
00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:51,685
But if you let it, it will destroy you...

204
00:20:52,227 --> 00:20:54,145
...as it almost did me.

205
00:20:54,312 --> 00:20:57,023
- What stopped it?
- Vengeance.

206
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,150
That's no help to me.

207
00:20:59,317 --> 00:21:01,152
Why, Bruce?

208
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:03,989
Why could you not
avenge your parents?

209
00:21:07,826 --> 00:21:11,288
Will you be heading back to Princeton
after the hearing, sir...

210
00:21:11,454 --> 00:21:14,124
...or can I persuade you to stay on
for a day or two?

211
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,501
I'm not heading back at all.

212
00:21:16,668 --> 00:21:18,712
- You don't like it there?
- I like it fine.

213
00:21:19,129 --> 00:21:21,923
They just don't feel the same way.

214
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:26,386
- I've prepared the master bedroom.
- No.

215
00:21:26,553 --> 00:21:27,971
My room will be fine.

216
00:21:28,138 --> 00:21:30,682
With all due respect, sir,
Wayne Manor is your house.

217
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:32,684
No, Alfred, it's my father's house.

218
00:21:32,851 --> 00:21:35,228
- Your father is dead.
- This place is a mausoleum.

219
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:38,440
If I have my way, I'll pull
the damn thing down brick by brick.

220
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:42,694
This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered
six generations of your family.

221
00:21:42,861 --> 00:21:45,572
Why do you give a damn, Alfred?
It's not your family.

222
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:50,285
I give a damn because a good man
once made me responsible...

223
00:21:50,952 --> 00:21:53,121
...for what was
most precious to him...

224
00:21:53,288 --> 00:21:55,540
...in the whole world.

225
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,046
Miss Dawes has offered
to drive you to the hearing.

226
00:22:01,212 --> 00:22:03,256
She probably hopes
to talk you out of going.

227
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:06,885
Should I just bury the past out there
with my parents, Alfred?

228
00:22:07,052 --> 00:22:10,138
I wouldn't presume to tell you
what to do with your past, sir.

229
00:22:10,305 --> 00:22:14,351
Just know that there are those of us who
care about what you do with your future.

230
00:22:15,727 --> 00:22:17,228
Haven't given up on me yet?

231
00:22:17,896 --> 00:22:19,397
Never.

232
00:23:07,946 --> 00:23:11,366
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk
on the top shelf.

233
00:23:12,242 --> 00:23:14,160
Hasn't he noticed
you're tall enough to reach now?

234
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:15,620
Old habits die hard, I guess.

235
00:23:15,996 --> 00:23:18,581
- Never used to stop us anyway.
- No, it didn't.

236
00:23:18,748 --> 00:23:20,625
How's your mom?

237
00:23:21,042 --> 00:23:23,295
She misses this place.

238
00:23:24,796 --> 00:23:26,298
So do I.

239
00:23:26,715 --> 00:23:27,966
Yeah.

240
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:31,136
But it's nothing without the people
who made it what it was.

241
00:23:31,303 --> 00:23:34,306
- Now there's only Alfred.
- And you.

242
00:23:34,472 --> 00:23:38,018
- I'm not staying, Rachel.
- You're just back for the hearing.

243
00:23:41,646 --> 00:23:45,817
Bruce, I don't suppose there's any way
to convince you not to come.

244
00:23:46,151 --> 00:23:49,654
Someone at this proceeding...

245
00:23:50,322 --> 00:23:52,490
...should stand for my parents.

246
00:23:52,657 --> 00:23:54,784
We all loved your parents, Bruce.

247
00:23:54,951 --> 00:23:58,163
- What Chill did is unforgivable.
- Then why is your boss letting him go?

248
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:02,792
In prison, he shared a cell
with Carmine Falcone.

249
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:06,630
He learned things, and he will testify
in exchange for early parole.

250
00:24:06,796 --> 00:24:09,466
Rachel, this man killed my parents.

251
00:24:11,468 --> 00:24:13,178
I cannot let that pass.

252
00:24:13,345 --> 00:24:16,222
And I need you
to understand that, please.

253
00:24:17,974 --> 00:24:19,184
Okay.

254
00:24:20,268 --> 00:24:23,605
The depression hit working people,
like Mr. Chill, hardest of all.

255
00:24:23,772 --> 00:24:26,983
His crime was appalling, yes,
but it was motivated not by greed...

256
00:24:27,317 --> 00:24:28,985
...but by desperation.

257
00:24:29,152 --> 00:24:33,073
Given the 14 years served, as well as
his extraordinary level of cooperation...

258
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:35,867
...with one of this office's
most important investigations...

259
00:24:36,034 --> 00:24:39,162
...we strongly endorse his petition
for early release.

260
00:24:40,163 --> 00:24:42,457
Mr. Chill?

261
00:24:46,044 --> 00:24:47,712
Your Honor...

262
00:24:48,588 --> 00:24:51,716
...not a day goes by that I don't wish
I could take back what I did.

263
00:24:54,344 --> 00:24:57,597
Sure, I was desperate,
like a lot of people back then...

264
00:24:57,764 --> 00:25:00,100
...but that don't change what I did.

265
00:25:03,728 --> 00:25:08,400
I gather there is a member
of the Wayne family here today.

266
00:25:08,566 --> 00:25:10,860
Has he got anything to say?

267
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:28,420
- He's coming out the side!
- He's coming out the side, guys!

268
00:25:38,096 --> 00:25:39,389
Bruce Wayne!

269
00:25:42,225 --> 00:25:43,435
Joe! Hey, Joe!

270
00:25:43,602 --> 00:25:45,103
Falcone says hi.

271
00:25:55,447 --> 00:25:59,034
Come on, Bruce.
We don't need to see this.

272
00:25:59,784 --> 00:26:01,328
I do.

273
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:08,460
The DA couldn't understand
why Judge Faden...

274
00:26:08,627 --> 00:26:10,462
...insisted on making the hearing public.

275
00:26:10,629 --> 00:26:13,048
Falcone paid him off
to get Chill out in the open.

276
00:26:13,256 --> 00:26:14,507
Maybe I should thank them.

277
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:17,260
- You don't mean that.
- What if I do, Rachel?

278
00:26:17,427 --> 00:26:19,346
My parents deserved justice.

279
00:26:19,512 --> 00:26:22,432
You're not talking about justice.
You're talking about revenge.

280
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:25,477
- Sometimes, they're the same.
- No, they're never the same.

281
00:26:25,644 --> 00:26:29,230
Justice is about harmony. Revenge is
about you making yourself feel better.

282
00:26:29,397 --> 00:26:32,692
- It's why we have an impartial system.
- Your system is broken.

283
00:26:39,783 --> 00:26:42,619
You care about justice?
Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.

284
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:44,496
This city is rotting.

285
00:26:44,663 --> 00:26:47,457
They talk about the depression
as if it's history. It's not.

286
00:26:47,624 --> 00:26:49,125
Things are worse than ever here.

287
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:51,836
Falcone floods our streets
with crime and drugs...

288
00:26:52,003 --> 00:26:54,965
...preying on the desperate,
creating new Joe Chills every day.

289
00:26:55,131 --> 00:26:57,676
Falcone may not have killed
your parents, Bruce...

290
00:26:58,301 --> 00:27:00,804
...but he's destroying everything
that they stood for.

291
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:08,228
You wanna thank him for that?
Here you go.

292
00:27:10,105 --> 00:27:13,149
We all know where to find him.
As long as he keeps the bad people rich...

293
00:27:13,316 --> 00:27:15,402
...and the good people scared,
no one'll touch him.

294
00:27:15,568 --> 00:27:19,864
Good people like your parents, who'll
stand against injustice, they're gone.

295
00:27:20,031 --> 00:27:23,743
What chance does Gotham have
when the good people do nothing?

296
00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:28,039
- I'm not one of your good people, Rachel.
- What do you mean?

297
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:33,336
All these years, I wanted to kill him.

298
00:27:34,129 --> 00:27:35,714
Now I can't.

299
00:27:51,605 --> 00:27:53,315
Your father would be ashamed of you.

300
00:28:36,775 --> 00:28:39,277
You're taller than you look
in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.

301
00:28:39,736 --> 00:28:41,613
No gun? I'm insulted.

302
00:28:44,783 --> 00:28:48,578
- You could've just sent a thank-you note.
- I didn't come here to thank you.

303
00:28:48,745 --> 00:28:51,498
I came to show you that
not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you.

304
00:28:51,665 --> 00:28:53,291
Only those who know me, kid.

305
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:56,127
Look around you.
You'll see two councilmen...

306
00:28:56,461 --> 00:28:59,297
...a union official,
couple off-duty cops...

307
00:28:59,714 --> 00:29:01,341
...and a judge.

308
00:29:01,508 --> 00:29:05,804
I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of
blowing your head off in front of them.

309
00:29:05,971 --> 00:29:08,682
Now, that's power you can't buy.

310
00:29:09,307 --> 00:29:10,767
That's the power of fear.

311
00:29:11,184 --> 00:29:12,435
I'm not afraid of you.

312
00:29:12,602 --> 00:29:14,521
Because you think you got
nothing to lose.

313
00:29:14,688 --> 00:29:16,356
But you haven't thought it through.

314
00:29:16,523 --> 00:29:19,609
You haven't thought about
your lady friend in the DA's office.

315
00:29:19,776 --> 00:29:22,195
You haven't thought about
your old butler.

316
00:29:26,324 --> 00:29:28,660
People from your world...

317
00:29:28,827 --> 00:29:31,204
...have so much to lose.

318
00:29:31,371 --> 00:29:35,709
Now, you think because your mommy
and your daddy got shot...

319
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,837
...you know about the ugly side of life,
but you don't.

320
00:29:39,004 --> 00:29:41,131
You've never tasted desperate.

321
00:29:41,298 --> 00:29:43,842
You're... You're Bruce Wayne,
the prince of Gotham.

322
00:29:44,009 --> 00:29:47,429
You'd have to go 1000 miles to meet
someone who didn't know your name.

323
00:29:47,596 --> 00:29:51,891
So don't come here with your anger,
trying to prove something to yourself.

324
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:54,185
This is a world
you'll never understand.

325
00:29:54,352 --> 00:29:56,354
And you always fear...

326
00:29:56,521 --> 00:29:58,982
...what you don't understand.

327
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,236
All right.

328
00:30:10,869 --> 00:30:13,705
Yeah, you got spirit, kid.
I'll give you that.

329
00:30:13,872 --> 00:30:15,874
More than your old man anyway.

330
00:30:16,041 --> 00:30:20,337
In the joint, Chill told me about
the night he killed your parents.

331
00:30:20,503 --> 00:30:22,714
He said your father begged for mercy.

332
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,842
Begged.

333
00:30:26,009 --> 00:30:27,385
Like a dog.

334
00:30:40,231 --> 00:30:42,025
Should've tipped better.

335
00:30:52,035 --> 00:30:53,870
- For what?
- Your jacket.

336
00:30:54,412 --> 00:30:56,039
Okay.

337
00:30:57,123 --> 00:31:00,585
Hey, hey, hey. Let me have it.
It's a nice coat.

338
00:31:00,752 --> 00:31:02,879
Be careful who sees you with that.

339
00:31:03,463 --> 00:31:05,382
- They're gonna come looking for me.
- Who?

340
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,550
Everyone.

341
00:31:09,844 --> 00:31:11,596
It's...

342
00:31:11,763 --> 00:31:13,765
It's a nice coat.

343
00:31:32,075 --> 00:31:36,454
When you lived among the criminals,
did you start to pity them?

344
00:31:36,621 --> 00:31:40,292
The first time I stole
so that I wouldn 't starve, yes.

345
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:45,964
I lost many assumptions about
the simple nature of right and wrong.

346
00:31:47,257 --> 00:31:49,342
And when I traveled...

347
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:52,220
...I learned the fear before a crime...

348
00:31:52,971 --> 00:31:55,557
...and the thrill of success.

349
00:31:57,434 --> 00:31:59,311
But I never became one of them.

350
00:32:02,772 --> 00:32:05,692
Fool. What do I care what your name is?
You're a criminal.

351
00:32:07,152 --> 00:32:08,945
Tell that to the guy who owned these.

352
00:32:12,157 --> 00:32:16,119
You've traveled the world to understand
the criminal mind and conquer your fears.

353
00:32:18,204 --> 00:32:22,334
But a criminal is not complicated.

354
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,837
And what you really fear
is inside yourself.

355
00:32:26,004 --> 00:32:28,548
You fear your own power.

356
00:32:28,715 --> 00:32:30,008
You fear your anger...

357
00:32:30,467 --> 00:32:34,721
...the drive to do great
or terrible things.

358
00:32:34,888 --> 00:32:38,350
Now you must journey inwards.

359
00:32:42,103 --> 00:32:44,189
You are ready.

360
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,608
Breathe.

361
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,036
Breathe.

362
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:04,876
Breathe in your fears.

363
00:33:07,504 --> 00:33:08,546
Face them.

364
00:33:10,048 --> 00:33:12,842
To conquer fear,
you must become fear.

365
00:33:13,009 --> 00:33:16,388
You must bask in the fear
of other men.

366
00:33:17,847 --> 00:33:21,268
And men fear most
what they cannot see.

367
00:33:38,493 --> 00:33:41,371
You have to become a terrible thought.

368
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:47,127
A wraith.

369
00:33:52,841 --> 00:33:55,218
You have to become an idea!

370
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,145
Feel terror cloud your senses.

371
00:34:06,896 --> 00:34:10,108
Feel its power to distort.

372
00:34:11,067 --> 00:34:13,278
To control.

373
00:34:16,364 --> 00:34:20,160
And know that this power
can be yours.

374
00:34:32,714 --> 00:34:35,383
Embrace your worst fear.

375
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:44,684
Become one with the darkness.

376
00:35:04,496 --> 00:35:06,206
Focus.

377
00:35:06,498 --> 00:35:08,667
Concentrate.

378
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:10,961
Master your senses.

379
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:41,491
You cannot leave any sign.

380
00:35:41,866 --> 00:35:43,076
I haven't.

381
00:35:51,376 --> 00:35:53,378
Impressive.

382
00:36:02,846 --> 00:36:04,556
We have purged your fear.

383
00:36:05,724 --> 00:36:07,350
You are ready to lead these men.

384
00:36:07,517 --> 00:36:11,062
You are ready to become a member
of the League of Shadows.

385
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:17,861
But first, you must demonstrate
your commitment to justice.

386
00:36:34,586 --> 00:36:35,962
No.

387
00:36:37,422 --> 00:36:38,715
I'm no executioner.

388
00:36:39,257 --> 00:36:42,928
Your compassion is a weakness
your enemies will not share.

389
00:36:43,303 --> 00:36:45,597
That's why it's so important.

390
00:36:45,847 --> 00:36:47,599
It separates us from them.

391
00:36:47,766 --> 00:36:50,143
You want to fight criminals.
This man is a murderer.

392
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,103
- This man should be tried.
- By whom?

393
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,980
Corrupt bureaucrats?

394
00:36:54,147 --> 00:36:56,650
Criminals mock society's laws.

395
00:36:56,816 --> 00:36:59,110
You know this better than most.

396
00:36:59,986 --> 00:37:02,614
You cannot lead these men...

397
00:37:02,781 --> 00:37:06,785
...unless you are prepared to do
what is necessary to defeat evil.

398
00:37:07,369 --> 00:37:09,788
And where would I be leading
these men?

399
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:11,623
Gotham.

400
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:13,833
As Gotham's favored son...

401
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,338
...you will be ideally placed
to strike at the heart of criminality.

402
00:37:18,713 --> 00:37:22,467
- How?
- Gotham's time has come.

403
00:37:22,634 --> 00:37:25,971
Like Constantinople
or Rome before it...

404
00:37:26,137 --> 00:37:30,350
...the city has become a breeding ground
for suffering and injustice.

405
00:37:30,517 --> 00:37:34,145
It is beyond saving
and must be allowed to die.

406
00:37:34,312 --> 00:37:39,484
This is the most important function
of the League of Shadows.

407
00:37:39,776 --> 00:37:42,862
It is one we've performed
for centuries.

408
00:37:43,196 --> 00:37:44,948
Gotham...

409
00:37:45,115 --> 00:37:47,993
...must be destroyed.

410
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:52,831
You can't believe in this.

411
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:57,586
Ra's al Ghul rescued us from
the darkest corners of our own hearts.

412
00:37:57,752 --> 00:38:02,173
What he asks in return is the courage
to do what is necessary.

413
00:38:02,382 --> 00:38:05,719
I will go back to Gotham
and I will fight men like this...

414
00:38:05,885 --> 00:38:08,471
...but I will not
become an executioner.

415
00:38:08,638 --> 00:38:10,181
Bruce, please.

416
00:38:10,348 --> 00:38:13,184
For your own sake,
there is no turning back.

417
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:48,094
- What are you doing?
- What's necessary, my friend.

418
00:41:04,522 --> 00:41:07,651
I will tell him you saved his life.

419
00:41:26,378 --> 00:41:28,922
Master Wayne,
you've been gone a long time.

420
00:41:29,089 --> 00:41:31,383
- Yes, I have.
- You look very fashionable.

421
00:41:32,884 --> 00:41:34,386
Apart from the mud.

422
00:41:34,636 --> 00:41:37,305
Are you coming back to Gotham
for long, sir?

423
00:41:37,472 --> 00:41:38,723
As long as it takes.

424
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:40,392
I want to show the people...

425
00:41:40,558 --> 00:41:43,979
...their city doesn't belong
to the criminals and the corrupt.

426
00:41:44,145 --> 00:41:47,357
In the depression, your father nearly
bankrupted Wayne Enterprises...

427
00:41:47,524 --> 00:41:48,733
...combating poverty.

428
00:41:48,942 --> 00:41:53,446
He believed his example could inspire
the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.

429
00:41:53,738 --> 00:41:55,365
Did it?

430
00:41:56,491 --> 00:41:57,951
In a way.

431
00:41:58,118 --> 00:42:01,204
Their murder shocked the wealthy
and the powerful into action.

432
00:42:03,206 --> 00:42:06,251
People need dramatic examples
to shake them out of apathy.

433
00:42:06,418 --> 00:42:08,086
I can't do that as Bruce Wayne.

434
00:42:08,253 --> 00:42:09,796
As a man...

435
00:42:09,963 --> 00:42:12,382
...I'm flesh and blood,
I can be ignored, destroyed.

436
00:42:12,549 --> 00:42:14,467
But as a symbol...

437
00:42:15,927 --> 00:42:18,597
As a symbol, I can be incorruptible.

438
00:42:18,763 --> 00:42:21,391
- I can be everlasting.
- What symbol?

439
00:42:21,975 --> 00:42:24,644
Something elemental...

440
00:42:24,811 --> 00:42:26,438
...something terrifying.

441
00:42:26,605 --> 00:42:28,732
I assume that as you take on
the underworld...

442
00:42:28,898 --> 00:42:34,029
...this symbol is a persona to protect
those you care about from reprisals?

443
00:42:34,195 --> 00:42:35,572
You're thinking about Rachel?

444
00:42:35,739 --> 00:42:38,116
Actually, sir, I was thinking of myself.

445
00:42:40,118 --> 00:42:41,870
Have you told anyone
I'm coming back?

446
00:42:42,078 --> 00:42:46,291
I couldn't figure the legal ramifications
of bringing you back from the dead.

447
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:48,335
- Dead?
- You've been gone seven years.

448
00:42:48,501 --> 00:42:49,794
You had me declared dead?

449
00:42:49,961 --> 00:42:52,839
Actually, it was Mr. Earle.
He's taking the company public.

450
00:42:53,006 --> 00:42:55,258
He wanted to liquidate
your majority shareholding.

451
00:42:55,467 --> 00:42:57,802
Those shares are worth
quite a bit of money.

452
00:42:57,969 --> 00:43:00,680
Well, it's a good thing
I left everything to you, then.

453
00:43:01,222 --> 00:43:02,849
Quite so, sir.

454
00:43:03,016 --> 00:43:06,770
And you can borrow the Rolls, if you like.
Just bring it back with a full tank.

455
00:43:16,738 --> 00:43:21,451
In my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much
a danger to himself as to others...

456
00:43:21,827 --> 00:43:26,415
...and prison is probably not the best
environment for his rehabilitation.

457
00:43:28,709 --> 00:43:31,294
- Dr. Crane.
- Miss Dawes.

458
00:43:31,461 --> 00:43:34,756
You think a man who butchers people
for the mob doesn't belong in jail?

459
00:43:34,923 --> 00:43:37,592
I would hardly have testified to that
otherwise, would I?

460
00:43:37,759 --> 00:43:40,846
This is the third of Falcone's thugs
you've had declared insane...

461
00:43:41,013 --> 00:43:42,431
...and moved into your asylum.

462
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:47,269
The work offered by organized crime
must have an attraction to the insane.

463
00:43:48,812 --> 00:43:50,814
Or the corrupt.

464
00:43:53,066 --> 00:43:54,651
Mr. Finch.

465
00:43:54,985 --> 00:43:56,778
You should check
with Miss Dawes here...

466
00:43:56,945 --> 00:44:01,325
...just what implications your office
has authorized her to make. If any.

467
00:44:05,287 --> 00:44:07,622
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing, Carl?

468
00:44:07,789 --> 00:44:09,166
Looking out for you.

469
00:44:11,668 --> 00:44:14,588
Falcone has half the city
bought and paid for.

470
00:44:14,755 --> 00:44:16,798
- Drop it.
- How can you say that?

471
00:44:16,965 --> 00:44:20,677
Because as much as I care about
getting Falcone, I care more about you.

472
00:44:20,844 --> 00:44:22,137
That's sweet.

473
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:29,936
We've been through all that.

474
00:44:56,004 --> 00:44:57,464
Blessed bat again, sir.

475
00:44:57,923 --> 00:45:00,342
They nest somewhere in the grounds.

476
00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:00,921
No more favors.
Someone is sniffing around.

477
00:47:01,088 --> 00:47:04,049
Hey, I scratch your back,
you scratch mine, doc.

478
00:47:04,216 --> 00:47:05,592
I'm bringing in the shipments.

479
00:47:06,301 --> 00:47:07,511
We are paying you for that.

480
00:47:07,678 --> 00:47:10,180
Maybe money isn't as interesting
to me as favors.

481
00:47:12,683 --> 00:47:17,479
I am more than aware that you are
not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.

482
00:47:17,646 --> 00:47:20,732
But you know who I'm working for,
and when he gets here...

483
00:47:20,899 --> 00:47:22,818
He... He's coming to Gotham?

484
00:47:22,984 --> 00:47:24,444
Yes, he is.

485
00:47:24,611 --> 00:47:27,072
And when he gets here,
he's not going to wanna hear...

486
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:32,327
...that you've endangered our operation
just to get your thugs out of jail time.

487
00:47:33,328 --> 00:47:36,665
- Who's bothering you?
- There's a girl at the DA's office.

488
00:47:37,165 --> 00:47:38,959
- We'll buy her off.
- Not this one.

489
00:47:40,085 --> 00:47:42,004
Idealist, huh?

490
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:43,880
Well, there's an answer to that too.

491
00:47:44,256 --> 00:47:47,217
- I don't want to know.
- Yes, you do.

492
00:47:51,388 --> 00:47:54,850
No, we are showing very healthy growth
in these sectors.

493
00:47:55,017 --> 00:47:58,186
I don't think Thomas Wayne would have
viewed heavy-arms manufacture...

494
00:47:58,353 --> 00:48:00,522
...as a suitable cornerstone
for our business.

495
00:48:01,898 --> 00:48:05,694
Well, that's 20 years ago, Fredericks.

496
00:48:06,028 --> 00:48:09,197
I think after 20 years
we can allow ourselves...

497
00:48:09,364 --> 00:48:12,200
...to stop thinking about what
Thomas Wayne would have done.

498
00:48:12,367 --> 00:48:14,244
Good morning, Mr. Earle's office.

499
00:48:14,411 --> 00:48:17,706
Yes, he's confirmed for
the dinner tomorrow evening.

500
00:48:17,873 --> 00:48:21,209
Good morning.
I'm here to see Mr. Earle.

501
00:48:21,376 --> 00:48:22,878
Name?

502
00:48:23,337 --> 00:48:25,005
Bruce Wayne.

503
00:48:26,882 --> 00:48:30,385
Thomas would probably not
have taken the company public.

504
00:48:30,552 --> 00:48:34,639
But that is what we,
as responsible managers, are going to do.

505
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:36,892
Jessica?

506
00:48:37,976 --> 00:48:40,520
Jessica? Where are you?

507
00:48:40,687 --> 00:48:44,941
- Eye on the ball, and...
- Why is no one answering the phone?

508
00:48:45,609 --> 00:48:48,779
It's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle.
I'm sure they'll call back.

509
00:48:49,112 --> 00:48:51,615
Bruce? You're supposed to be dead.

510
00:48:51,782 --> 00:48:53,742
I'm sorry to disappoint.

511
00:48:53,909 --> 00:48:56,620
- I need you to take a look at this.
- Have you seen him yet?

512
00:48:56,912 --> 00:48:58,455
- Who?
- Wayne.

513
00:48:58,789 --> 00:49:00,874
It's been all over the news.
He's back.

514
00:49:04,795 --> 00:49:07,714
I'm sure you realize
I can't stop the big machine.

515
00:49:07,881 --> 00:49:09,132
Too many wheels turning.

516
00:49:09,299 --> 00:49:11,301
- We're going public.
- I understand.

517
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,596
And I'll be handsomely rewarded
for my shares.

518
00:49:14,763 --> 00:49:17,307
I'm not looking to interfere.

519
00:49:17,766 --> 00:49:19,893
- I am looking for a job.
- Oh?

520
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:23,105
I just want to get to know the company
that my family built.

521
00:49:23,438 --> 00:49:25,190
Any ideas where you would start?

522
00:49:25,691 --> 00:49:28,068
Applied Sciences caught my eye.

523
00:49:28,443 --> 00:49:30,153
Fox's department.

524
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,322
I'll let him know you're coming.

525
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,993
You look like him. Your dad.

526
00:49:36,785 --> 00:49:39,454
You're the only one left
of the Wayne family.

527
00:49:39,621 --> 00:49:43,583
This is where you belong.
Welcome home.

528
00:49:43,917 --> 00:49:48,422
Environmental procedures,
defense projects, consumer products.

529
00:49:48,922 --> 00:49:51,633
All prototypes. None in production.

530
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,469
- On any level whatsoever.
- None?

531
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:57,305
What did they tell you this place was?

532
00:49:57,472 --> 00:49:59,516
They didn't tell me anything.

533
00:50:01,977 --> 00:50:05,439
Earle told me exactly what it was
when he sent me down here.

534
00:50:05,897 --> 00:50:07,357
Dead end.

535
00:50:07,524 --> 00:50:10,861
Place to keep me from causing
the board any more trouble.

536
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,322
Come on.

537
00:50:13,488 --> 00:50:15,949
- You were on the board?
- When your father ran things.

538
00:50:16,116 --> 00:50:17,993
- You knew my father?
- Oh, yeah.

539
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,828
Helped him build his train.

540
00:50:20,412 --> 00:50:22,039
Here we are.

541
00:50:25,709 --> 00:50:27,336
Kevlar utility harness.

542
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:29,671
Gas-powered, magnetic grapple gun.

543
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:32,174
The 350-pound test monofilament.

544
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:37,679
Wonderful project, your dad's train.

545
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:42,809
Routed it right into Wayne Tower,
along with the water and power utilities.

546
00:50:42,976 --> 00:50:46,188
Kind of made Wayne Tower
the unofficial center of Gotham City.

547
00:50:46,396 --> 00:50:49,024
Of course, Earle let it go to rot.
Here we are.

548
00:50:50,901 --> 00:50:53,028
Nomex survival suit
for advanced infantry.

549
00:50:53,236 --> 00:50:55,989
Kevlar biweave, reinforced joints.

550
00:50:56,323 --> 00:50:58,700
- Tear-resistant?
- This sucker will stop a knife.

551
00:50:58,867 --> 00:51:01,078
- Bulletproof?
- Anything but a straight shot.

552
00:51:01,244 --> 00:51:04,122
- Why didn't they put it into production?
- Bean counters didn't think...

553
00:51:04,289 --> 00:51:06,667
...a soldier's life was worth 300 grand.

554
00:51:07,751 --> 00:51:11,213
So, what's your interest in it,
Mr. Wayne?

555
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,382
I want to borrow it.

556
00:51:13,548 --> 00:51:15,342
For spelunking.

557
00:51:16,218 --> 00:51:17,511
Spelunking?

558
00:51:17,678 --> 00:51:19,388
Yeah, you know, cave diving?

559
00:51:20,681 --> 00:51:23,350
You expecting to run into
much gunfire in these caves?

560
00:51:25,686 --> 00:51:28,939
Look, I'd rather Mr. Earle
didn't know about me borrowing...

561
00:51:29,106 --> 00:51:30,357
Mr. Wayne...

562
00:51:30,565 --> 00:51:32,484
...the way I see it...

563
00:51:32,943 --> 00:51:35,404
...all this stuff is yours anyway.

564
00:51:38,365 --> 00:51:40,867
Okay. Give it a try.

565
00:51:44,997 --> 00:51:46,248
Charming.

566
00:51:49,084 --> 00:51:50,877
At least you'll have company.

567
00:51:52,754 --> 00:51:56,758
This must be the lowest foundation
of the southeast wing.

568
00:52:09,229 --> 00:52:13,400
Your great-great-grandfather was
involved in the Underground Railroad...

569
00:52:13,567 --> 00:52:16,570
...secretly transporting freed slaves
to the North...

570
00:52:16,737 --> 00:52:20,449
...and I suspect these caverns
came in handy.

571
00:52:33,128 --> 00:52:35,297
Alfred! Come up here!

572
00:52:35,505 --> 00:52:38,467
I can see everything all right
from down here, sir, thank you.

573
00:52:58,487 --> 00:53:01,156
We order the main part
of this cowl from Singapore.

574
00:53:01,323 --> 00:53:02,824
Via a dummy corporation.

575
00:53:02,991 --> 00:53:04,826
Indeed. And then, quite separately...

576
00:53:04,993 --> 00:53:09,956
...we place an order
to a Chinese company for these.

577
00:53:10,499 --> 00:53:13,460
- Put it together ourselves.
- Precisely.

578
00:53:13,627 --> 00:53:17,673
They'll have to be large orders,
to avoid suspicion.

579
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:20,384
- How large?
- Say 10,000.

580
00:53:22,886 --> 00:53:25,806
- Well, at least we'll have spares.
- Yes.

581
00:53:42,906 --> 00:53:44,992
Don't suppose you want a taste.

582
00:53:45,158 --> 00:53:48,328
I just keep offering,
thinking maybe someday you'll get wise.

583
00:53:48,495 --> 00:53:50,664
There's nothing wise
in what you do, Flass.

584
00:53:50,831 --> 00:53:54,209
Well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste,
makes us guys nervous.

585
00:53:54,376 --> 00:53:56,211
I'm no rat.

586
00:53:58,964 --> 00:54:02,676
In a town this bent,
who's there to rat to anyway?

587
00:54:32,372 --> 00:54:34,499
Don't turn around.

588
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:38,170
You're a good cop.
One of the few.

589
00:54:38,837 --> 00:54:39,963
What do you want?

590
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:43,300
Carmine Falcone brings in
shipments of drugs every week.

591
00:54:43,467 --> 00:54:45,260
Nobody takes him down. Why?

592
00:54:46,678 --> 00:54:48,805
He's paid up with the right people.

593
00:54:49,097 --> 00:54:51,892
What will it take to bring him down?

594
00:54:52,601 --> 00:54:55,020
Leverage on Judge Faden...

595
00:54:55,729 --> 00:54:58,106
...and a DA brave enough
to prosecute.

596
00:54:58,523 --> 00:55:00,150
Rachel Dawes.

597
00:55:00,734 --> 00:55:01,860
Who are you?

598
00:55:02,277 --> 00:55:03,904
Watch for my sign.

599
00:55:06,573 --> 00:55:08,617
You're just one man?

600
00:55:09,034 --> 00:55:10,452
Now we're two.

601
00:55:12,579 --> 00:55:14,164
We?

602
00:55:29,805 --> 00:55:31,556
Freeze!

603
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,659
What the hell was that?

604
00:55:53,578 --> 00:55:54,788
Just some nut.

605
00:55:58,208 --> 00:56:01,003
Well, what is it today?
More spelunking?

606
00:56:01,169 --> 00:56:03,672
No. Today it's BASE-jumping.

607
00:56:04,256 --> 00:56:05,882
BASE-jumping.

608
00:56:06,466 --> 00:56:09,011
- That like parachuting?
- Kind of.

609
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:13,015
Do you have any lightweight fabrics?

610
00:56:13,181 --> 00:56:15,851
You know,
I think I have just the thing.

611
00:56:17,185 --> 00:56:19,646
It's called memory cloth.
Notice anything?

612
00:56:22,983 --> 00:56:24,860
Regularly flexible...

613
00:56:25,277 --> 00:56:27,404
...but put a current through it...

614
00:56:28,864 --> 00:56:32,576
...molecules realign, it becomes rigid.
- What kind of shapes can you make?

615
00:56:32,743 --> 00:56:35,871
Can be tailored to fit any structure
based on a rigid skeleton.

616
00:56:36,038 --> 00:56:37,247
Too expensive for the Army?

617
00:56:37,414 --> 00:56:42,169
I don't think they tried to market it
to the billionaire, BASE-jumping crowd.

618
00:56:42,336 --> 00:56:44,129
- Look, Mr. Fox.
- Yes, sir?

619
00:56:44,796 --> 00:56:46,173
If you're uncomfortable...

620
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:49,551
Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me
exactly what you're doing...

621
00:56:49,718 --> 00:56:51,678
...when I'm asked, I don't have to lie.

622
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:56,016
But don't think of me as an idiot.

623
00:56:57,517 --> 00:56:59,478
Fair enough.

624
00:57:01,396 --> 00:57:03,231
What's that?

625
00:57:05,317 --> 00:57:07,235
The Tumbler?

626
00:57:07,736 --> 00:57:09,696
Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.

627
00:57:15,702 --> 00:57:17,621
She was built as a bridging vehicle.

628
00:57:19,623 --> 00:57:24,044
During combat, two of these
would jump over a river, towing cables.

629
00:57:26,588 --> 00:57:30,217
Over here on the throttle,
flip that open and throttle up.

630
00:57:30,425 --> 00:57:32,969
This will boost you into a rampless jump...
Not now!

631
00:57:35,806 --> 00:57:37,933
Not... Not now, sir.

632
00:57:40,769 --> 00:57:42,646
Afterburner disengaged.

633
00:57:43,021 --> 00:57:46,066
We never could get
the damn bridge to work...

634
00:57:46,233 --> 00:57:47,943
...but this baby works just fine.

635
00:57:57,494 --> 00:57:58,745
So, what do you think?

636
00:57:59,997 --> 00:58:01,999
Does it come in black?

637
00:58:02,624 --> 00:58:05,002
I need you at the docks Thursday.

638
00:58:05,252 --> 00:58:07,129
- Problems?
- I don't want any trouble...

639
00:58:07,295 --> 00:58:09,423
...with the last shipment.
- Sure.

640
00:58:11,008 --> 00:58:14,678
Word on the street is you got a beef
with somebody in the DA's office.

641
00:58:14,845 --> 00:58:17,264
- Is that right?
- And that there's a fat prize...

642
00:58:17,431 --> 00:58:20,142
...waiting for anybody willing
to do anything about it.

643
00:58:20,308 --> 00:58:22,269
So, what's your point, Mr. Flass?

644
00:58:22,728 --> 00:58:23,979
Have you seen the girl?

645
00:58:24,479 --> 00:58:27,149
It's a cute little assistant D A.

646
00:58:27,316 --> 00:58:30,986
Don 't you think that's a little too much
heat to bring down, maybe?

647
00:58:31,153 --> 00:58:34,489
- Even for this town.
- Never underestimate Gotham City.

648
00:58:34,656 --> 00:58:37,492
People get mugged coming home
from work every day of the week.

649
00:58:37,659 --> 00:58:40,287
Sometimes...
Sometimes things just go bad.

650
00:58:44,166 --> 00:58:45,959
It's a problem with the graphite, sir.

651
00:58:46,168 --> 00:58:48,837
The next 10,000
will be up to specifications.

652
00:58:49,004 --> 00:58:51,590
- At least they gave us a discount.
- Quite.

653
00:58:51,757 --> 00:58:57,387
In the meantime, sir, may I suggest
you try to avoid landing on your head?

654
00:59:34,383 --> 00:59:36,426
Why bats, Master Wayne?

655
00:59:36,677 --> 00:59:37,928
Bats frighten me.

656
00:59:39,221 --> 00:59:41,515
It's time my enemies shared my dread.

657
01:00:08,208 --> 01:00:10,127
What is this?

658
01:00:13,922 --> 01:00:15,257
Continue.

659
01:00:20,762 --> 01:00:22,431
Looks fine out there.

660
01:00:22,848 --> 01:00:24,766
The bears go straight to the dealers.

661
01:00:24,933 --> 01:00:27,602
Yeah, and the rabbits go
to the man in the Narrows.

662
01:00:27,769 --> 01:00:30,772
- What's the difference?
- Ignorance is bliss, my friend.

663
01:00:30,939 --> 01:00:34,109
Don't burden yourself
with the secrets of scary people.

664
01:00:49,958 --> 01:00:52,961
Hey. Steiss.

665
01:01:14,274 --> 01:01:15,734
Steiss?

666
01:01:27,663 --> 01:01:29,289
What?

667
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,500
What the...?

668
01:01:40,509 --> 01:01:42,344
I better check it.

669
01:01:54,898 --> 01:01:56,900
There's a problem out here.
You better bail.

670
01:02:26,221 --> 01:02:27,848
Where are you?!

671
01:02:28,015 --> 01:02:29,057
Here.

672
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:53,415
Get going. Oh, shit.

673
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,727
What the hell are you?

674
01:03:16,772 --> 01:03:17,939
I'm Batman.

675
01:03:26,281 --> 01:03:28,241
Nice coat.

676
01:03:29,951 --> 01:03:31,495
Thanks.

677
01:04:12,536 --> 01:04:13,787
Hold it.

678
01:04:15,914 --> 01:04:18,375
That's right, you better run.

679
01:04:27,342 --> 01:04:29,177
Falcone sent them to kill you.

680
01:04:30,303 --> 01:04:32,889
- Why?
- You rattled his cage.

681
01:04:36,685 --> 01:04:38,228
- What's this?
- Leverage.

682
01:04:38,395 --> 01:04:40,022
- For what?
- To get things moving.

683
01:04:40,314 --> 01:04:42,316
Who are you?

684
01:04:42,691 --> 01:04:43,942
Someone like you.

685
01:04:44,109 --> 01:04:46,153
Someone who'll rattle the cages.

686
01:04:51,241 --> 01:04:54,745
Ma'am? Everything okay?

687
01:04:59,041 --> 01:05:01,543
- Falcone's men?
- Does it matter?

688
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:04,004
We'll never tie him to it anyway.

689
01:05:04,212 --> 01:05:06,340
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

690
01:05:19,394 --> 01:05:21,229
What the hell is that?

691
01:05:30,822 --> 01:05:32,074
Cut him down.

692
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:55,931
Unacceptable.

693
01:05:56,098 --> 01:05:58,934
Now, I don't care if it's rival gangs,
Guardian Angels...

694
01:05:59,101 --> 01:06:01,061
...or the goddamn Salvation Army...

695
01:06:01,311 --> 01:06:03,647
...get them off the street
and off the front page.

696
01:06:03,814 --> 01:06:06,400
They say it was just one guy.
Or a creature.

697
01:06:06,566 --> 01:06:09,277
It was some asshole in a costume.

698
01:06:09,778 --> 01:06:11,446
- Yeah?
- This guy did deliver us...

699
01:06:11,613 --> 01:06:14,408
...one of the city's biggest crime lords.

700
01:06:14,574 --> 01:06:18,078
No one takes the law
into their own hands in my city.

701
01:06:18,245 --> 01:06:19,454
Understand?

702
01:06:19,746 --> 01:06:22,207
- No way to bury it now.
- There's still Judge Faden.

703
01:06:22,374 --> 01:06:25,460
- I've got Faden covered.
- What about this bat they babble about?

704
01:06:25,627 --> 01:06:28,755
Even if these guys will swear
to being thrashed by a giant bat...

705
01:06:28,922 --> 01:06:31,091
...we've got Falcone at the scene.

706
01:06:31,258 --> 01:06:34,469
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests.
This bat character gave us everything.

707
01:06:34,886 --> 01:06:36,430
Okay. Let's do it.

708
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:41,977
- Bats are nocturnal.
- Bats may be.

709
01:06:42,144 --> 01:06:45,564
But even for billionaire playboys,
3:00 is pushing it.

710
01:06:46,606 --> 01:06:49,484
The price for leading a double life,
I fear.

711
01:06:50,819 --> 01:06:53,238
Your theatrics made an impression.

712
01:06:54,614 --> 01:06:57,659
Theatricality and deception...

713
01:06:57,826 --> 01:07:01,038
...are powerful weapons, Alfred.
This is a good start.

714
01:07:01,204 --> 01:07:03,999
If those are to be the first
of many injuries to come...

715
01:07:04,166 --> 01:07:07,002
...it would be wise
to find a suitable excuse.

716
01:07:07,336 --> 01:07:08,670
Polo, for instance.

717
01:07:08,837 --> 01:07:10,505
I'm not learning polo, Alfred.

718
01:07:10,756 --> 01:07:14,426
Strange injuries,
a nonexistent social life.

719
01:07:14,593 --> 01:07:16,053
These things beg the question...

720
01:07:16,219 --> 01:07:20,474
...as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne
do with his time and his money.

721
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,225
What does someone like me do?

722
01:07:23,185 --> 01:07:27,397
Drive sports cars, date movie stars.

723
01:07:28,065 --> 01:07:29,650
Buy things that are not for sale.

724
01:07:29,816 --> 01:07:33,362
Who knows, Master Wayne,
you start pretending to have fun...

725
01:07:33,987 --> 01:07:35,989
...you might even have a little
by accident.

726
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:40,160
Sir.

727
01:07:40,327 --> 01:07:42,663
- We have a situation.
- All right.

728
01:07:43,038 --> 01:07:46,875
The Coast Guard picked up
one of our cargo ships last night...

729
01:07:47,417 --> 01:07:52,214
...heavily damaged, all crew missing,
probably dead.

730
01:07:54,257 --> 01:07:56,635
The ship was carrying
a prototype weapon.

731
01:07:56,843 --> 01:07:58,637
It's a microwave emitter.

732
01:07:58,804 --> 01:08:01,765
It's designed for desert warfare,
but it...

733
01:08:03,433 --> 01:08:05,018
It looks like somebody...

734
01:08:09,398 --> 01:08:10,899
...turned it on.

735
01:08:15,070 --> 01:08:19,533
It uses focused microwaves to
vaporize the enemy's water supply.

736
01:08:27,457 --> 01:08:30,419
The damage to the ship
was catastrophic.

737
01:08:30,585 --> 01:08:33,588
The weapon itself is...

738
01:08:34,881 --> 01:08:36,383
Missing?

739
01:08:37,217 --> 01:08:38,468
Yeah.

740
01:08:39,761 --> 01:08:41,722
Mr. Wayne.

741
01:08:45,434 --> 01:08:46,893
Nice car.

742
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:48,437
You should see my other one.

743
01:08:58,447 --> 01:09:00,407
He's done something
the police never have.

744
01:09:00,574 --> 01:09:02,868
You can't take the law
into your own hands.

745
01:09:03,035 --> 01:09:05,620
Well, at least he's getting
something done.

746
01:09:05,787 --> 01:09:08,123
Bruce, help me out here.

747
01:09:08,290 --> 01:09:12,627
Well, a guy who dresses up
like a bat clearly has issues.

748
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:15,922
But he's put Falcone behind bars.

749
01:09:16,089 --> 01:09:18,467
And now the cops want him.
What does that tell you?

750
01:09:18,633 --> 01:09:19,843
They're jealous.

751
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:22,637
Sir, the pool is for decoration...

752
01:09:22,804 --> 01:09:26,183
...and your friends
do not have swimwear.

753
01:09:27,976 --> 01:09:29,978
Well, they're European.

754
01:09:31,813 --> 01:09:34,191
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

755
01:09:35,108 --> 01:09:38,570
- It is not a question of money.
- Well, you see...

756
01:09:39,154 --> 01:09:40,947
...I'm buying this hotel...

757
01:09:42,741 --> 01:09:47,162
...and setting some new rules
about the pool area.

758
01:09:48,330 --> 01:09:50,707
I think the Batman deserves a medal.

759
01:09:50,874 --> 01:09:53,001
And a straitjacket to pin it on.

760
01:09:59,508 --> 01:10:01,093
Thank you.

761
01:10:02,844 --> 01:10:04,179
Bruce?

762
01:10:07,766 --> 01:10:09,559
Rachel?

763
01:10:09,726 --> 01:10:11,144
I'd heard you were back.

764
01:10:13,188 --> 01:10:14,690
What are you doing?

765
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:19,861
Just swimming here.
Wow, it is good to see you.

766
01:10:20,028 --> 01:10:21,571
You were gone a long time.

767
01:10:22,155 --> 01:10:25,075
- I know. How are things?
- The same.

768
01:10:26,994 --> 01:10:28,662
Job's getting worse.

769
01:10:28,829 --> 01:10:31,540
Can't change the world on your own.

770
01:10:31,707 --> 01:10:33,792
What choice do I have...

771
01:10:34,459 --> 01:10:36,211
...when you're too busy swimming?

772
01:10:37,546 --> 01:10:39,589
Rachel, all of...

773
01:10:39,881 --> 01:10:41,550
All this...

774
01:10:42,968 --> 01:10:47,014
It's... It's not me. It's...

775
01:10:47,431 --> 01:10:50,058
Inside, I am...

776
01:10:51,268 --> 01:10:53,228
I am more.

777
01:10:53,895 --> 01:10:55,439
Come on, Bruce. Come on.

778
01:10:55,605 --> 01:10:59,401
Bruce, we have some more hotels
for you to buy.

779
01:11:00,444 --> 01:11:01,903
Bruce...

780
01:11:03,071 --> 01:11:06,575
...deep down you may still be
that same great kid you used to be.

781
01:11:08,994 --> 01:11:11,580
But it's not who you are underneath...

782
01:11:12,039 --> 01:11:13,790
...it's what you do that defines you.

783
01:11:26,345 --> 01:11:27,929
Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.

784
01:11:28,096 --> 01:11:30,974
Not at all. He cut his wrists?

785
01:11:31,141 --> 01:11:34,811
Probably looking for the insanity plea.
But if anything should happen...

786
01:11:34,978 --> 01:11:37,939
Of course, better safe than sorry.

787
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:44,946
Yeah, Dr. Crane, I can't take it anymore.
It's all too much.

788
01:11:45,113 --> 01:11:47,574
The walls are closing in.
Blah, blah, blah.

789
01:11:48,116 --> 01:11:50,619
A couple of days of this food,
it'll be true.

790
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:53,288
- What do you want?
- I wanna know...

791
01:11:53,455 --> 01:11:55,957
...how you're gonna convince me
to keep my mouth shut.

792
01:11:56,124 --> 01:11:58,293
About what?
You don't know anything.

793
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:02,631
I know you don't want the cops to take
a closer look at the drugs they seized.

794
01:12:02,798 --> 01:12:06,968
And I know about your experiments
with the inmates of your nut house.

795
01:12:07,135 --> 01:12:10,806
See, I don't go into business with a guy
without finding out his dirty secrets.

796
01:12:11,390 --> 01:12:14,309
And those goons you used.

797
01:12:14,476 --> 01:12:16,311
I own the muscle in this town.

798
01:12:16,478 --> 01:12:19,856
Now, I've been bringing
your stuff in for months...

799
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:24,611
...so whatever he's planning,
it's big, and I want in.

800
01:12:25,904 --> 01:12:29,032
Well, I already know what he'll say.

801
01:12:29,449 --> 01:12:30,826
That we should kill you.

802
01:12:32,703 --> 01:12:35,998
Even he can't get me in here.
Not in my town.

803
01:12:41,962 --> 01:12:43,505
Would you like to see my mask?

804
01:12:45,048 --> 01:12:46,508
I use it in my experiments.

805
01:12:49,011 --> 01:12:53,473
Now, I'm probably not very frightening
to a guy like you.

806
01:12:53,849 --> 01:12:56,685
But these crazies, they can't stand it.

807
01:12:57,602 --> 01:12:59,563
So when did the nut
take over the nut house?

808
01:13:00,522 --> 01:13:03,191
They scream and they cry...

809
01:13:04,192 --> 01:13:05,819
...much as you're doing now.

810
01:13:08,155 --> 01:13:11,366
Well, he's not faking. Not that one.

811
01:13:11,533 --> 01:13:14,077
I'll talk to the judge
and see if I can get him moved...

812
01:13:14,244 --> 01:13:17,664
...to the secure wing at Arkham.
I can't treat him here.

813
01:13:39,686 --> 01:13:41,188
Storm's coming.

814
01:13:45,776 --> 01:13:48,779
The scum is getting jumpy
because you stood up to Falcone.

815
01:13:48,945 --> 01:13:52,491
It's a start. Your partner
was at the docks with Falcone.

816
01:13:52,658 --> 01:13:55,369
Well, he moonlights
as a low-level enforcer.

817
01:13:55,744 --> 01:13:59,539
They were splitting the shipment in two.
Only half went to the dealers.

818
01:13:59,706 --> 01:14:01,625
Why? What about the other half?

819
01:14:02,084 --> 01:14:04,503
- Flass knows.
- He won't talk.

820
01:14:05,128 --> 01:14:06,713
He'll talk to me.

821
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:09,925
Commissioner Loeb set up
a massive task force to catch you.

822
01:14:10,384 --> 01:14:12,928
- He thinks you're dangerous.
- What do you think?

823
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:17,099
I think you're trying to help.

824
01:14:22,104 --> 01:14:24,439
But I've been wrong before.

825
01:14:30,237 --> 01:14:31,947
Come on, I ain't got all night.

826
01:14:35,283 --> 01:14:37,119
Flass, I have kids to feed.

827
01:14:37,577 --> 01:14:39,746
What, they don't like falafel?

828
01:14:55,137 --> 01:14:56,847
Where were the other drugs going?

829
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:00,309
I never knew. I don't know.

830
01:15:00,475 --> 01:15:02,686
- I swear to God.
- Swear to me!

831
01:15:08,317 --> 01:15:11,320
I don't... I don't know.
I never knew. Never.

832
01:15:11,611 --> 01:15:15,073
They went to some guy for a couple days
before they went to the dealers.

833
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:16,533
Why?

834
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:20,787
There was something...
Something else in the drugs...

835
01:15:20,954 --> 01:15:22,539
...something hidden.
- What?

836
01:15:22,706 --> 01:15:26,043
I never went to the drop-off point.
It was in the Narrows.

837
01:15:26,209 --> 01:15:29,504
- Cops only go there in force.
- Do I look like a cop?

838
01:15:29,671 --> 01:15:31,465
No...

839
01:15:45,062 --> 01:15:47,105
This is the one I'm talking about.

840
01:15:47,397 --> 01:15:49,691
- What's your problem with it?
- It shouldn't exist.

841
01:15:49,858 --> 01:15:53,695
This ship left Singapore with
246 containers, but arrived with 247.

842
01:15:53,862 --> 01:15:56,239
I'm guessing there's something
I'm not supposed to find in there.

843
01:15:56,406 --> 01:15:59,826
Listen, counselor, we don't wanna
know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.

844
01:15:59,993 --> 01:16:03,330
Things are working a little
differently now. Open it up.

845
01:16:12,923 --> 01:16:14,174
What the hell is this?

846
01:16:56,758 --> 01:16:59,928
It's you, isn't it?
Everybody's been talking about you.

847
01:17:00,512 --> 01:17:02,264
Get in here!

848
01:17:02,889 --> 01:17:05,017
The other kids won't believe me.

849
01:17:28,123 --> 01:17:30,250
Get rid of all traces.

850
01:17:30,542 --> 01:17:33,462
- Better torch the whole place.
- All right.

851
01:18:09,498 --> 01:18:11,291
Having trouble?

852
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,336
Take a seat. Have a drink.

853
01:18:15,045 --> 01:18:18,298
You look like a man
who takes himself too seriously.

854
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:25,013
Do you want my opinion?
You need to lighten up.

855
01:19:16,982 --> 01:19:20,694
Alfred, help me.

856
01:19:30,579 --> 01:19:33,957
Blood. Take. Take poison.
Blood poison.

857
01:19:34,124 --> 01:19:37,127
Poisonous. Poisonous.

858
01:19:41,423 --> 01:19:43,133
Bruce...

859
01:19:44,426 --> 01:19:45,594
...why do we fall?

860
01:19:57,689 --> 01:20:01,026
- How long was I out?
- Two days.

861
01:20:01,401 --> 01:20:03,236
It's your birthday.

862
01:20:04,571 --> 01:20:05,822
Many happy returns.

863
01:20:11,036 --> 01:20:14,831
I've felt these effects before,
but this was so much more potent.

864
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:19,586
It was some kind of hallucinogen,
weaponized, in aerosol form.

865
01:20:19,795 --> 01:20:22,714
You have been hanging out
in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.

866
01:20:22,923 --> 01:20:26,009
I called Mr. Fox when your condition
worsened after the first day.

867
01:20:26,176 --> 01:20:27,552
I analyzed your blood...

868
01:20:27,719 --> 01:20:31,181
...isolating the receptor compounds
and the protein-based catalyst.

869
01:20:31,390 --> 01:20:33,183
Am I meant to understand any of that?

870
01:20:33,558 --> 01:20:36,687
Not at all. I just wanted you to know
how hard it was.

871
01:20:37,312 --> 01:20:40,983
- Bottom line, I synthesized an antidote.
- Could you make more?

872
01:20:41,191 --> 01:20:43,735
You planning on gassing yourself
again, Mr. Wayne?

873
01:20:43,944 --> 01:20:47,114
Well, you know how it is.
You're out at night, looking for kicks...

874
01:20:47,322 --> 01:20:50,075
...someone's passing around
the weaponized hallucinogens...

875
01:20:50,242 --> 01:20:53,662
I'll bring what I have.
The antidote should inoculate you for now.

876
01:20:53,870 --> 01:20:56,206
Alfred, always a pleasure.

877
01:20:56,415 --> 01:20:58,041
Lucius.

878
01:21:02,587 --> 01:21:05,257
- You sure you don't want to come in?
- I have to get back.

879
01:21:05,424 --> 01:21:07,134
- I wanted to leave this.
- Thank you.

880
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:08,677
Rachel?

881
01:21:10,053 --> 01:21:13,223
Looks like someone's been
burning the candle at both ends.

882
01:21:13,432 --> 01:21:16,101
- Must've been quite an occasion.
- It is my birthday.

883
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:19,938
I know. I'm sorry I can't come tonight.
I was just dropping off your present.

884
01:21:20,147 --> 01:21:23,567
- You've got better plans?
- My boss has been missing for days...

885
01:21:23,775 --> 01:21:27,446
...which means I should probably start
by looking at the bottom of the river.

886
01:21:27,654 --> 01:21:29,114
- Rachel.
- Excuse me.

887
01:21:32,034 --> 01:21:33,243
Rachel Dawes.

888
01:21:33,869 --> 01:21:37,456
Who authorized that? Get Crane down
there now. Don't take no for an answer.

889
01:21:37,664 --> 01:21:41,501
Call Dr. Lehmann, tell him we need our
own assessment to the judge by morning.

890
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:43,754
- What's wrong?
- It's Falcone.

891
01:21:43,962 --> 01:21:46,423
Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum
on suicide watch.

892
01:21:46,631 --> 01:21:49,634
You're going to Arkham now?
It's in the Narrows, Rachel.

893
01:21:50,886 --> 01:21:52,679
You enjoy your party, Bruce.

894
01:21:52,888 --> 01:21:55,641
- Some of us have work to do.
- You be careful.

895
01:21:57,392 --> 01:21:58,935
Happy birthday.

896
01:22:18,372 --> 01:22:20,457
But, Master Wayne,
the guests will be arriving.

897
01:22:20,666 --> 01:22:22,292
Keep them happy until I arrive.

898
01:22:22,459 --> 01:22:24,628
Tell them that joke you know.

899
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,210
Having fun?

900
01:23:07,337 --> 01:23:10,882
Bill? Now, what's a big shot like you
doing in a place like this?

901
01:23:11,091 --> 01:23:12,342
I need some information.

902
01:23:12,551 --> 01:23:17,306
The Wayne Enterprise 47-B, 1 -ME.

903
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:20,100
1 -ME.

904
01:23:20,309 --> 01:23:24,021
It's a microwave emitter. It was designed
to vaporize an enemy's water supply.

905
01:23:24,229 --> 01:23:28,442
Rumor was they tested dispersing
water-based chemicals into the air...

906
01:23:28,608 --> 01:23:30,527
...but isn't that illegal?

907
01:23:32,279 --> 01:23:36,491
I want all the information
on the development of this project...

908
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:40,662
...all data, files, backup disks,
on my desk right away.

909
01:23:41,079 --> 01:23:42,706
Did you lose one?

910
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:47,377
I'm merging your department
with Archives.

911
01:23:48,628 --> 01:23:49,880
And I am firing you.

912
01:23:52,049 --> 01:23:54,009
Didn't you get the memo?

913
01:24:01,266 --> 01:24:02,893
Scarecrow.

914
01:24:06,229 --> 01:24:08,065
Scarecrow.

915
01:24:11,443 --> 01:24:12,736
Scarecrow.

916
01:24:15,781 --> 01:24:17,949
Miss Dawes, this is most irregular.

917
01:24:18,158 --> 01:24:21,078
I have nothing to add
to the report I filed with the judge.

918
01:24:21,244 --> 01:24:23,455
- I have questions about your report.
- Such as?

919
01:24:23,664 --> 01:24:27,959
Isn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man
who has no history of mental illness...

920
01:24:28,126 --> 01:24:31,713
...to have a psychotic breakdown
just when he's about to be indicted?

921
01:24:31,922 --> 01:24:36,134
As you can see for yourself, there is
nothing convenient about his symptoms.

922
01:24:40,806 --> 01:24:42,182
- Scarecrow.
- What's "scarecrow"?

923
01:24:42,683 --> 01:24:46,269
Patients suffering delusional episodes
often focus their paranoia...

924
01:24:46,478 --> 01:24:48,563
...on an external tormentor...

925
01:24:48,772 --> 01:24:51,942
...usually one conforming
to Jungian archetypes.

926
01:24:52,192 --> 01:24:54,569
In this case, a scarecrow.

927
01:24:56,071 --> 01:25:00,200
- He's drugged?
- Psychopharmacology is my primary field.

928
01:25:00,367 --> 01:25:01,743
I'm a strong advocate.

929
01:25:02,661 --> 01:25:04,830
Outside, he was a giant.

930
01:25:05,038 --> 01:25:07,457
In here, only the mind
can grant you power.

931
01:25:07,666 --> 01:25:09,376
You enjoy the reversal.

932
01:25:09,584 --> 01:25:12,587
I respect the mind's power
over the body.

933
01:25:12,754 --> 01:25:14,297
It's why I do what I do.

934
01:25:14,464 --> 01:25:19,344
I do what I do to keep thugs like Falcone
behind bars, not in therapy.

935
01:25:19,553 --> 01:25:22,806
I want my own psychiatric consultant
to have full access to Falcone...

936
01:25:23,015 --> 01:25:26,351
...including blood work.
Find out what exactly you put him on.

937
01:25:26,518 --> 01:25:28,979
- First thing tomorrow, then.
- Tonight.

938
01:25:29,187 --> 01:25:32,607
I've already paged Dr. Lehmann
at County General.

939
01:25:34,026 --> 01:25:35,819
As you wish.

940
01:25:41,366 --> 01:25:43,327
This way, please.

941
01:25:43,493 --> 01:25:46,079
There's something
I think you should see.

942
01:25:57,007 --> 01:25:59,593
This is where we make the medicine.

943
01:26:06,433 --> 01:26:10,312
Perhaps you should have some,
clear your head.

944
01:26:35,587 --> 01:26:37,214
Who knows you're here?

945
01:26:38,256 --> 01:26:39,883
Who knows?

946
01:26:47,099 --> 01:26:48,308
He's here.

947
01:26:48,517 --> 01:26:49,726
Who?

948
01:26:49,935 --> 01:26:51,895
The Batman.

949
01:26:53,689 --> 01:26:55,565
- What do we do?
- What anyone does...

950
01:26:55,774 --> 01:26:58,527
...when a prowler comes around.

951
01:26:59,486 --> 01:27:02,030
- Call the police.
- You want the cops here?

952
01:27:02,614 --> 01:27:05,367
At this point, they can't stop us.

953
01:27:05,575 --> 01:27:09,079
But the Batman
has a talent for disruption.

954
01:27:09,287 --> 01:27:12,457
Force him outside,
the police will take him down. Go.

955
01:27:12,666 --> 01:27:14,751
- What about her?
- She hasn't got long.

956
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,920
I gave her a concentrated dose.

957
01:27:17,087 --> 01:27:19,631
The mind can only take so much.
Now go.

958
01:27:22,175 --> 01:27:24,428
The things they say about him.

959
01:27:24,636 --> 01:27:26,179
Can he really fly?

960
01:27:26,346 --> 01:27:28,390
I heard he can disappear.

961
01:27:28,598 --> 01:27:31,601
Well, we'll find out.

962
01:27:31,893 --> 01:27:33,520
Won't we?

963
01:28:20,859 --> 01:28:22,986
Taste of your own medicine, doctor?

964
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:31,495
What have you been doing here?

965
01:28:34,623 --> 01:28:37,000
Who are you working for?

966
01:28:41,463 --> 01:28:43,799
Ra's... Ra's al Ghul.

967
01:28:44,007 --> 01:28:48,845
Ra's al Ghul is dead.
Who are you working for?

968
01:28:49,054 --> 01:28:50,055
Crane.

969
01:28:52,557 --> 01:28:55,477
Dr. Crane isn't here right now.

970
01:28:56,061 --> 01:28:57,938
But if you'd like to make
an appointment...

971
01:29:10,993 --> 01:29:13,912
Batman, put down your weapons
and surrender.

972
01:29:14,621 --> 01:29:15,998
You're surrounded.

973
01:29:21,586 --> 01:29:24,339
- What are you waiting for?
- Backup.

974
01:29:25,090 --> 01:29:27,467
- Backup?
- The Batman's in there.

975
01:29:27,676 --> 01:29:29,803
SWAT's on the way.
But if you wanna go in now...

976
01:29:30,012 --> 01:29:31,555
...I'll be right behind you, sir.

977
01:29:33,056 --> 01:29:34,599
SWAT's on the way.

978
01:29:35,684 --> 01:29:36,935
- Hey.
- Hey.

979
01:30:19,478 --> 01:30:21,188
What's happened to her?

980
01:30:23,857 --> 01:30:27,611
Crane poisoned her with a psychotropic
hallucinogen, a panic-inducing toxin.

981
01:30:29,655 --> 01:30:33,367
- Let me get her down to the medics.
- They can't help her, but I can.

982
01:30:37,329 --> 01:30:39,456
Get her downstairs.
Meet me in the alley.

983
01:30:47,464 --> 01:30:50,300
Crane's been smuggling his toxin
hidden in Falcone's drugs...

984
01:30:50,509 --> 01:30:52,636
...and they're dumping it
into the water supply.

985
01:30:53,178 --> 01:30:54,805
- What was he planning?
- I don't know.

986
01:30:55,055 --> 01:30:56,348
Was he working for Falcone?

987
01:30:56,848 --> 01:30:59,351
He mentioned someone else,
someone worse.

988
01:30:59,559 --> 01:31:02,104
She needs the antidote
before the damage is permanent.

989
01:31:02,312 --> 01:31:04,481
- How long does she have?
- Not long.

990
01:31:08,402 --> 01:31:10,195
What is that?

991
01:31:11,571 --> 01:31:13,824
- Backup.
- What the...?

992
01:32:31,793 --> 01:32:33,336
Excuse me.

993
01:32:38,091 --> 01:32:41,302
- How is she?
- She's fading. We gotta go.

994
01:32:43,179 --> 01:32:44,639
I'll get my car.

995
01:32:44,806 --> 01:32:46,599
I brought mine.

996
01:32:47,016 --> 01:32:48,643
Yours?

997
01:32:57,985 --> 01:32:59,779
I've gotta get me one of those.

998
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:03,157
- He is in a vehicle.
- Make and color?

999
01:33:03,366 --> 01:33:05,702
It's a black...

1000
01:33:07,036 --> 01:33:08,329
...tank.

1001
01:33:10,998 --> 01:33:12,375
Stay calm.

1002
01:33:13,042 --> 01:33:14,836
You've been poisoned.

1003
01:33:17,547 --> 01:33:18,840
I'm on him.

1004
01:33:27,265 --> 01:33:28,307
Breathe slowly.

1005
01:33:38,443 --> 01:33:39,527
Hold on.

1006
01:33:54,042 --> 01:33:55,418
- What are you doing?
- Shortcut.

1007
01:34:03,926 --> 01:34:05,720
Air One to ground, block that ramp.

1008
01:34:10,266 --> 01:34:11,893
He's got no way off that roof.

1009
01:34:13,269 --> 01:34:16,355
Turn off your engine.
Step away from the car.

1010
01:34:18,733 --> 01:34:21,486
- Trust me.
- Weapons system activated.

1011
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:40,671
Who is this guy?

1012
01:34:41,005 --> 01:34:42,715
- Where's he going?
- He's on the roof.

1013
01:34:57,146 --> 01:34:59,315
- What street is he taking?
- He's not on a street.

1014
01:34:59,524 --> 01:35:01,234
He's flying on rooftops.

1015
01:35:40,481 --> 01:35:42,692
At least tell me what it looks like.

1016
01:35:45,737 --> 01:35:47,196
Never mind.

1017
01:35:51,075 --> 01:35:52,452
Got him.

1018
01:36:03,337 --> 01:36:04,881
Coming right up on his butt.

1019
01:36:29,614 --> 01:36:32,033
We're tracking suspect vehicle
heading west on l- 17.

1020
01:36:37,330 --> 01:36:39,040
- Air One to ground.
- I lost him.

1021
01:36:39,207 --> 01:36:41,042
We've lost visual. Exit 9 is blocked.

1022
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:43,211
We'll loop back to check
the frontage road.

1023
01:36:43,419 --> 01:36:45,505
Stealth mode activated.

1024
01:36:46,172 --> 01:36:47,382
Stay with me.

1025
01:36:53,596 --> 01:36:55,056
What...? There he is.

1026
01:37:14,784 --> 01:37:16,244
Just hold on.

1027
01:37:20,206 --> 01:37:21,374
Rachel!

1028
01:37:54,157 --> 01:37:56,492
- They get any of this into the mains?
- Yeah.

1029
01:37:56,701 --> 01:37:59,537
Notify the water company.
There's gotta be a way to isolate it.

1030
01:37:59,746 --> 01:38:02,582
No. They put it all in.
They must've been at this for weeks.

1031
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:06,335
- Gotham's entire water supply is laced.
- Why haven't we felt the effects?

1032
01:38:06,544 --> 01:38:08,796
Must be a compound that has
to be absorbed through the lungs.

1033
01:38:19,057 --> 01:38:20,767
How do you feel?

1034
01:38:23,519 --> 01:38:24,979
Where are we?

1035
01:38:25,521 --> 01:38:29,275
- Why did you bring me here?
- lf I hadn't, your mind would be lost.

1036
01:38:29,484 --> 01:38:31,486
- You were poisoned.
- It was...

1037
01:38:31,694 --> 01:38:35,281
- It was Dr. Crane.
- Rest. Gordon has Crane.

1038
01:38:35,490 --> 01:38:37,575
Is Sergeant Gordon your friend?

1039
01:38:38,451 --> 01:38:40,078
I don't have the luxury of friends.

1040
01:38:40,995 --> 01:38:44,332
I'm gonna give you a sedative.
You'll wake up back at home.

1041
01:38:44,499 --> 01:38:48,419
When you do, get these to Gordon,
and Gordon alone. Trust no one.

1042
01:38:48,628 --> 01:38:50,338
- What are they?
- The antidote.

1043
01:38:50,546 --> 01:38:53,841
One for Gordon to inoculate himself,
the other for mass production.

1044
01:38:54,258 --> 01:38:55,510
Mass production?

1045
01:38:55,718 --> 01:38:58,846
Crane was just a pawn.
We need to be ready.

1046
01:39:24,831 --> 01:39:28,209
When you told me your grand plan
for saving Gotham...

1047
01:39:28,418 --> 01:39:31,337
...all that stopped me
from calling the men in white coats...

1048
01:39:31,504 --> 01:39:33,965
...was when you said
it wasn't about thrill-seeking.

1049
01:39:34,173 --> 01:39:37,176
- It's not.
- What would you call that?

1050
01:39:39,053 --> 01:39:41,723
- Damn good television.
- It's a miracle no one was killed.

1051
01:39:41,931 --> 01:39:45,560
I didn't have time to observe
the rules of the road, Alfred.

1052
01:39:45,768 --> 01:39:48,855
You're getting lost inside
this monster of yours.

1053
01:39:49,063 --> 01:39:53,443
I'm using this monster to help
other people, just like my father did.

1054
01:39:53,651 --> 01:39:55,194
For Thomas Wayne, helping others...

1055
01:39:55,403 --> 01:39:58,322
...wasn't about proving anything
to anyone, including himself.

1056
01:39:58,781 --> 01:40:02,118
It's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying.

1057
01:40:02,577 --> 01:40:05,163
She's downstairs, sedated.
I need you to take her home.

1058
01:40:05,496 --> 01:40:09,083
Well, we both care for Rachel, but what
you're doing has to be beyond that.

1059
01:40:09,417 --> 01:40:12,336
It can't be personal,
or you're just a vigilante.

1060
01:40:12,503 --> 01:40:14,338
- Is Fox still here?
- Yes, sir.

1061
01:40:14,547 --> 01:40:16,174
We need to send these people away.

1062
01:40:16,382 --> 01:40:19,302
Those are Bruce Wayne's guests.
You have a name to maintain.

1063
01:40:19,510 --> 01:40:21,304
I don't care about my name.

1064
01:40:21,512 --> 01:40:24,682
It's not just your name, sir.
It's your father's name.

1065
01:40:26,434 --> 01:40:28,770
And it's all that's left of him.

1066
01:40:30,730 --> 01:40:32,273
Don't destroy it.

1067
01:40:47,622 --> 01:40:49,749
- Mr. Earle.
- Happy birthday, Bruce.

1068
01:40:49,957 --> 01:40:51,334
Thank you.

1069
01:40:51,667 --> 01:40:53,669
How did the stock offering go?

1070
01:40:53,961 --> 01:40:55,129
Prices soared.

1071
01:40:55,338 --> 01:40:56,547
Who was buying?

1072
01:40:56,756 --> 01:40:58,633
All kinds of funds and brokerages.

1073
01:40:58,841 --> 01:41:00,551
It's a bit technical.

1074
01:41:00,718 --> 01:41:02,428
The key thing is...

1075
01:41:02,595 --> 01:41:04,555
...our company's future is secure.

1076
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:07,433
Great.

1077
01:41:21,155 --> 01:41:23,449
A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid.

1078
01:41:29,205 --> 01:41:30,998
What was the plan, Crane?

1079
01:41:31,165 --> 01:41:33,376
How were you gonna get
your toxin into the air?

1080
01:41:33,793 --> 01:41:37,046
Scarecrow. Scarecrow.

1081
01:41:37,255 --> 01:41:39,048
Who were you working for, Crane?

1082
01:41:41,175 --> 01:41:43,344
Oh, it's too late.

1083
01:41:43,970 --> 01:41:46,055
You can't stop it now.

1084
01:41:51,144 --> 01:41:52,687
Here.

1085
01:41:52,854 --> 01:41:54,814
- Happy birthday, Bruce.
- Thank you. Thanks.

1086
01:41:55,023 --> 01:41:57,942
And thank you for that item.

1087
01:41:59,444 --> 01:42:00,653
You're welcome.

1088
01:42:00,862 --> 01:42:03,614
- I know you'll put it to good use.
- I already have.

1089
01:42:03,906 --> 01:42:07,702
How long would it take
to manufacture on a large scale?

1090
01:42:08,286 --> 01:42:09,370
Weeks. Why?

1091
01:42:09,579 --> 01:42:12,707
Somebody's planning to disperse
the toxin using the water supply.

1092
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:16,836
The water supply won't help you
disperse an inhalant.

1093
01:42:17,754 --> 01:42:19,130
What?

1094
01:42:19,338 --> 01:42:21,841
Unless you have a microwave emitter
powerful enough...

1095
01:42:22,050 --> 01:42:24,886
...to vaporize all the water
in the mains.

1096
01:42:25,344 --> 01:42:28,598
A microwave emitter like the one
Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.

1097
01:42:29,057 --> 01:42:30,224
Misplaced?

1098
01:42:30,433 --> 01:42:33,895
Earle just fired me for asking
too many questions about it.

1099
01:42:35,938 --> 01:42:39,400
Go back to Wayne Enterprises now
and start making more of that antidote.

1100
01:42:39,609 --> 01:42:42,695
The police are gonna need as much
as they can get their hands on.

1101
01:42:42,904 --> 01:42:44,947
My security clearance
has been revoked.

1102
01:42:45,156 --> 01:42:47,116
That wouldn't stop a man like you,
would it?

1103
01:42:47,575 --> 01:42:49,285
I suppose not.

1104
01:42:51,329 --> 01:42:55,958
- Bruce, there's somebody you must meet.
- Not now, Mrs. Delane.

1105
01:42:56,167 --> 01:42:59,003
Now, am I pronouncing this right...

1106
01:42:59,212 --> 01:43:01,631
...Mr. Ra's al Ghul?

1107
01:43:07,303 --> 01:43:09,097
You're not Ra's al Ghul.

1108
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:11,891
I watched him die.

1109
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:15,103
But is Ra's al Ghul immortal?

1110
01:43:17,897 --> 01:43:20,316
Are his methods supernatural?

1111
01:43:24,904 --> 01:43:29,283
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal
your true identity, Ra's?

1112
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:35,623
Surely a man who spends his nights
scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...

1113
01:43:35,832 --> 01:43:37,834
...wouldn't begrudge me
dual identities.

1114
01:43:38,710 --> 01:43:40,503
I saved your life.

1115
01:43:40,670 --> 01:43:43,131
I warned you about compassion, Bruce.

1116
01:43:46,342 --> 01:43:48,511
Your quarrel is with me.

1117
01:43:49,429 --> 01:43:51,889
You let these people go.

1118
01:43:52,181 --> 01:43:55,435
You are welcome to explain
the situation to them.

1119
01:43:57,729 --> 01:43:59,355
Everyone.

1120
01:44:00,148 --> 01:44:01,983
Everybody?

1121
01:44:04,610 --> 01:44:06,487
I...

1122
01:44:06,946 --> 01:44:11,159
I want to thank you all for coming here
tonight and drinking all of my booze.

1123
01:44:13,286 --> 01:44:14,996
No, really.

1124
01:44:16,039 --> 01:44:18,791
There's a thing about being a Wayne...

1125
01:44:18,958 --> 01:44:22,503
...that you're never short of
a few freeloaders, like yourselves...

1126
01:44:22,712 --> 01:44:26,340
...to fill up your mansion with.
So here's to you people. Thank you.

1127
01:44:26,549 --> 01:44:29,135
- That's enough, Bruce.
- I'm not finished.

1128
01:44:29,510 --> 01:44:31,220
To all of you...

1129
01:44:31,387 --> 01:44:35,767
All of you phonies,
all of you two-faced friends...

1130
01:44:35,933 --> 01:44:40,980
...you sycophantic suck-ups
who smile through your teeth at me...

1131
01:44:41,189 --> 01:44:44,734
...please, leave me in peace.

1132
01:44:44,942 --> 01:44:47,528
Please go.

1133
01:44:47,904 --> 01:44:51,282
Stop smiling, it's not a joke.
Please leave.

1134
01:44:51,491 --> 01:44:53,659
The party's over, get out.

1135
01:44:53,868 --> 01:44:57,121
The apple has fallen very far
from the tree, Mr. Wayne.

1136
01:45:01,959 --> 01:45:04,212
He's turning into a jerk.

1137
01:45:10,551 --> 01:45:12,261
Amusing.

1138
01:45:12,595 --> 01:45:16,015
But pointless.
None of these people have long to live.

1139
01:45:16,224 --> 01:45:19,686
Your antics at the asylum
have forced my hand.

1140
01:45:19,894 --> 01:45:22,021
So Crane was working for you.

1141
01:45:22,230 --> 01:45:26,025
His toxin is derived from the organic
compound found in our blue flowers.

1142
01:45:26,401 --> 01:45:28,403
He was able to weaponize it.

1143
01:45:28,611 --> 01:45:30,571
He's not a member of
the League of Shadows?

1144
01:45:30,780 --> 01:45:35,326
Of course not. He thought our plan
was to hold the city to ransom.

1145
01:45:36,035 --> 01:45:40,581
But really, you are gonna release
Crane's poison on the entire city.

1146
01:45:40,748 --> 01:45:44,794
Then watch Gotham tear itself apart
through fear.

1147
01:45:57,640 --> 01:45:59,517
You're gonna destroy millions of lives.

1148
01:45:59,767 --> 01:46:03,104
Only a cynical man would call
what these people have "lives," Wayne.

1149
01:46:03,271 --> 01:46:05,064
Crime. Despair.

1150
01:46:05,273 --> 01:46:07,316
This is not how man
was supposed to live.

1151
01:46:07,984 --> 01:46:11,112
The League of Shadows has been
a check against human corruption...

1152
01:46:11,320 --> 01:46:12,780
...for thousands of years.

1153
01:46:12,989 --> 01:46:16,534
We sacked Rome.
Loaded trade ships with plague rats.

1154
01:46:16,743 --> 01:46:18,119
Burned London to the ground.

1155
01:46:18,327 --> 01:46:21,164
Every time a civilization reaches
the pinnacle of its decadence...

1156
01:46:21,330 --> 01:46:23,291
...we return to restore the balance.

1157
01:46:23,458 --> 01:46:25,001
Gotham isn't beyond saving.

1158
01:46:26,335 --> 01:46:29,005
Give me more time.
There are good people here.

1159
01:46:29,213 --> 01:46:31,007
You're defending a city so corrupt...

1160
01:46:31,215 --> 01:46:34,385
...we have infiltrated
every level of its infrastructure.

1161
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:46,856
Time to play.

1162
01:46:51,027 --> 01:46:53,696
When I found you in that jail,
you were lost.

1163
01:46:53,863 --> 01:46:55,948
But I believed in you.

1164
01:46:56,157 --> 01:46:59,869
I took away your fear,
and I showed you a path.

1165
01:47:00,161 --> 01:47:02,372
You were my greatest student.

1166
01:47:02,705 --> 01:47:05,833
It should be you standing by my side,
saving the world.

1167
01:47:06,667 --> 01:47:09,253
I'll be standing where I belong.

1168
01:47:09,921 --> 01:47:13,007
Between you
and the people of Gotham.

1169
01:47:14,717 --> 01:47:17,303
No one can save Gotham.

1170
01:47:20,681 --> 01:47:25,311
When a forest grows too wild,
a purging fire is inevitable and natural.

1171
01:47:26,562 --> 01:47:31,192
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror
as its greatest city destroys itself.

1172
01:47:31,776 --> 01:47:35,029
The movement back to harmony
will be unstoppable this time.

1173
01:47:35,321 --> 01:47:37,490
- You attacked Gotham before?
- Of course.

1174
01:47:37,740 --> 01:47:40,410
Over the ages our weapons
have grown more sophisticated.

1175
01:47:40,576 --> 01:47:43,413
With Gotham we tried a new one.
Economics.

1176
01:47:43,871 --> 01:47:48,543
But we underestimated certain
of Gotham's citizens...

1177
01:47:49,001 --> 01:47:51,170
...such as your parents.

1178
01:47:55,258 --> 01:47:58,720
Gunned down by one of the very people
they were trying to help.

1179
01:47:59,011 --> 01:48:01,764
Create enough hunger
and everyone becomes a criminal.

1180
01:48:01,973 --> 01:48:04,392
Their deaths galvanized the city
into saving itself...

1181
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:07,270
...and Gotham has limped on
ever since.

1182
01:48:07,478 --> 01:48:09,272
We are back to finish the job.

1183
01:48:09,981 --> 01:48:13,234
And this time no misguided idealists
will get in the way.

1184
01:48:13,401 --> 01:48:16,946
Like your father, you lack the courage
to do all that is necessary.

1185
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:20,116
If someone stands in the way
of true justice...

1186
01:48:20,324 --> 01:48:24,370
...you simply walk up behind them
and stab them in the heart.

1187
01:48:29,417 --> 01:48:31,544
- I am gonna stop you.
- You never did learn...

1188
01:48:31,753 --> 01:48:33,755
...to mind your surroundings.

1189
01:48:35,965 --> 01:48:37,925
Justice is balance.

1190
01:48:38,134 --> 01:48:40,261
You burned my house
and left me for dead.

1191
01:48:42,972 --> 01:48:45,099
Consider us even.

1192
01:49:01,532 --> 01:49:03,242
No one comes out. Make sure.

1193
01:49:13,169 --> 01:49:14,629
They're all gone?

1194
01:49:14,796 --> 01:49:17,548
- How many from maximum security?
- Every one of them.

1195
01:49:17,715 --> 01:49:19,509
Serial killers, rapists.

1196
01:49:19,717 --> 01:49:22,553
Raise the bridges.
We don't want any getting off the island.

1197
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:24,180
Yeah, I'll raise the bridges...

1198
01:49:24,347 --> 01:49:28,559
...when I get every available unit out here
to catch the homicidal maniacs...

1199
01:49:28,768 --> 01:49:31,604
...that are running loose out there.
- Come on!

1200
01:49:54,836 --> 01:49:57,588
I hope you're not a member
of the fire brigade.

1201
01:50:03,594 --> 01:50:05,680
Master Wayne! Master Wayne!

1202
01:50:10,226 --> 01:50:14,605
What is the point of all those pushups
if you can't even lift a bloody log?

1203
01:50:53,061 --> 01:50:55,104
What have I done, Alfred?

1204
01:50:56,147 --> 01:50:58,066
Everything my family...

1205
01:50:58,274 --> 01:51:00,151
...my father, built...

1206
01:51:02,570 --> 01:51:06,449
The Wayne legacy is more
than bricks and mortar, sir.

1207
01:51:06,657 --> 01:51:08,868
I wanted to save Gotham.

1208
01:51:09,744 --> 01:51:11,579
I failed.

1209
01:51:12,830 --> 01:51:14,082
Why do we fall, sir?

1210
01:51:17,293 --> 01:51:20,755
So that we can learn
to pick ourselves up.

1211
01:51:23,257 --> 01:51:25,385
You still haven't given up on me?

1212
01:51:27,303 --> 01:51:28,763
Never.

1213
01:51:29,847 --> 01:51:31,140
Down!

1214
01:51:31,349 --> 01:51:34,268
Harassment! I see harassment!

1215
01:51:34,435 --> 01:51:36,479
Maybe you'd like to see
some excessive force?

1216
01:51:36,688 --> 01:51:38,564
Madman with a gun.

1217
01:51:39,774 --> 01:51:43,111
With residents furious at the
unprecedented show of police strength...

1218
01:51:43,277 --> 01:51:46,656
...to round up the inmates...
- We're about to raise these bridges.

1219
01:51:46,864 --> 01:51:50,451
Officer, I am a Gotham City
district attorney. Let me pass.

1220
01:51:57,875 --> 01:52:00,128
- Just shut up!
- Hey, Flass, cool it!

1221
01:52:00,336 --> 01:52:01,587
Hold these people back.

1222
01:52:01,796 --> 01:52:04,799
Hey, Gordon.
Somebody here to see you.

1223
01:52:04,966 --> 01:52:07,343
- What are you doing here?
- Our friend sent me with this.

1224
01:52:07,552 --> 01:52:09,011
It counteracts Crane's toxin.

1225
01:52:09,178 --> 01:52:10,638
Hopefully you won't need it.

1226
01:52:10,847 --> 01:52:13,975
Not unless he's got some way
of getting that crap into the air.

1227
01:52:15,143 --> 01:52:17,562
All right, last one across.

1228
01:52:18,271 --> 01:52:22,150
People, they want this bridge up
in no more than three minutes!

1229
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:25,737
Better get you off the island before
they raise the bridges. Patrolman!

1230
01:52:26,404 --> 01:52:27,405
Go!

1231
01:52:54,223 --> 01:52:56,017
I can't find my mom.

1232
01:52:56,392 --> 01:52:57,852
Hey!

1233
01:53:06,277 --> 01:53:07,987
What the hell are you doing?

1234
01:53:09,530 --> 01:53:11,074
Gentlemen...

1235
01:53:11,532 --> 01:53:14,035
...time to spread the word.

1236
01:53:15,787 --> 01:53:17,163
And the word is...

1237
01:53:18,456 --> 01:53:20,166
...panic.

1238
01:53:44,273 --> 01:53:45,900
Jesus. The pressure, it's spiking.

1239
01:53:46,901 --> 01:53:48,194
Right there.

1240
01:53:48,528 --> 01:53:50,738
That water main
is right under the Narrows.

1241
01:54:07,714 --> 01:54:09,257
It's okay.

1242
01:54:42,123 --> 01:54:43,666
This is Commissioner Loeb.

1243
01:54:43,833 --> 01:54:45,543
Come on, somebody talk to me.

1244
01:54:45,710 --> 01:54:47,170
Come on!

1245
01:55:06,856 --> 01:55:08,858
Loeb, Loeb. This is Gordon.

1246
01:55:09,192 --> 01:55:10,485
What the hell is going on?

1247
01:55:10,693 --> 01:55:14,113
We need reinforcements.
TAC teams, SWAT, riot cops!

1248
01:55:14,322 --> 01:55:18,534
Gordon! All the city's riot police
are on the island with you!

1249
01:55:18,701 --> 01:55:20,703
Well, they're completely incapacitated!

1250
01:55:21,037 --> 01:55:24,999
It's okay, it's okay.
No one's gonna hurt you.

1251
01:55:25,875 --> 01:55:27,502
Of course they are!

1252
01:55:27,710 --> 01:55:30,713
- Crane?
- No. Scarecrow.

1253
01:55:32,465 --> 01:55:33,841
Gordon...

1254
01:55:34,050 --> 01:55:36,260
...there's nobody left to send in.

1255
01:55:37,845 --> 01:55:39,555
So I'm on my own?

1256
01:55:43,643 --> 01:55:45,269
The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces.

1257
01:55:45,478 --> 01:55:48,022
This is just the beginning.
If they hit the whole city...

1258
01:55:48,231 --> 01:55:50,983
...there's nothing to stop Gotham
tearing itself apart.

1259
01:55:51,150 --> 01:55:53,027
- How are they gonna do that?
- The train.

1260
01:55:53,236 --> 01:55:57,031
The monorail follows the water mains to
the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.

1261
01:55:57,240 --> 01:55:58,950
If the machine gets to the station...

1262
01:55:59,117 --> 01:56:02,578
...it'll cause a chain reaction
that'll vaporize the city's water supply.

1263
01:56:02,787 --> 01:56:04,330
Covering Gotham in this poison.

1264
01:56:04,539 --> 01:56:07,709
I'm gonna stop him from loading
that train, but I may need your help.

1265
01:56:07,917 --> 01:56:09,711
- What do you need?
- Can you drive stick?

1266
01:56:15,967 --> 01:56:17,593
There you are!

1267
01:56:17,802 --> 01:56:19,762
There is nothing to fear...

1268
01:56:19,971 --> 01:56:21,681
...but fear itself!

1269
01:56:22,765 --> 01:56:25,059
I am here to help!

1270
01:56:56,299 --> 01:56:58,426
Batman will save us. He'll come.

1271
01:57:03,681 --> 01:57:05,558
- He'll come.
- Don't peek.

1272
01:57:14,233 --> 01:57:17,570
This is Gordon.
Prepare to lower the bridge.

1273
01:57:23,493 --> 01:57:25,578
I told you he'd come.

1274
01:57:30,625 --> 01:57:32,251
Wait.

1275
01:57:33,211 --> 01:57:34,837
You could die.

1276
01:57:35,004 --> 01:57:36,255
At least tell me your name.

1277
01:57:41,677 --> 01:57:43,846
It's not who I am underneath...

1278
01:57:44,847 --> 01:57:49,143
...but what I do that defines me.

1279
01:57:49,519 --> 01:57:50,812
Bruce?

1280
01:58:24,554 --> 01:58:27,849
Well, well. You took my advice
about theatricality a bit literally.

1281
01:58:28,057 --> 01:58:30,518
- It ends here.
- For you and the police, maybe.

1282
01:58:30,727 --> 01:58:33,021
My fight, however,
lies with the rest of Gotham.

1283
01:58:33,229 --> 01:58:36,524
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a city to destroy.

1284
01:58:36,733 --> 01:58:40,403
- I can't beat two of your pawns?
- As you wish.

1285
01:58:53,249 --> 01:58:55,543
GPS online.

1286
01:59:02,425 --> 01:59:04,594
In 100 yards.

1287
01:59:35,500 --> 01:59:36,751
Gentlemen.

1288
02:00:04,195 --> 02:00:06,406
Who the hell authorized this?

1289
02:00:16,999 --> 02:00:19,043
Distance to Wayne Tower, three miles.

1290
02:00:26,342 --> 02:00:28,928
The pressure's moving along the mains,
blowing the pipes.

1291
02:00:29,137 --> 02:00:30,513
If that pressure reaches us...

1292
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:33,683
...the water supply right across
the whole city is gonna blow!

1293
02:00:44,152 --> 02:00:46,988
At the next intersection, turn right.

1294
02:01:11,721 --> 02:01:13,181
You will never learn.

1295
02:01:20,730 --> 02:01:21,731
Sorry.

1296
02:01:25,735 --> 02:01:28,738
- Familiar. Don't you have anything new?
- How about this?!

1297
02:01:45,505 --> 02:01:47,757
You have arrived at Wayne Tower.

1298
02:02:01,104 --> 02:02:02,313
Evacuate the building.

1299
02:02:02,563 --> 02:02:05,024
We're on top of the main hub
and it's gonna blow.

1300
02:02:13,950 --> 02:02:16,119
Weapons system activated.

1301
02:02:20,248 --> 02:02:21,249
Nice ride.

1302
02:02:36,514 --> 02:02:37,515
Armed.

1303
02:02:49,485 --> 02:02:50,945
Don't be afraid, Bruce.

1304
02:02:53,740 --> 02:02:55,116
Come on. Come on.

1305
02:02:59,871 --> 02:03:01,914
You are just an ordinary man in a cape.

1306
02:03:02,123 --> 02:03:05,960
That's why you couldn't fight injustice,
that's why you can't stop this train.

1307
02:03:06,169 --> 02:03:08,713
Who said anything about stopping it?

1308
02:03:14,552 --> 02:03:16,095
Yes!

1309
02:03:24,270 --> 02:03:27,648
You never learned
to mind your surroundings!

1310
02:03:35,531 --> 02:03:37,992
Have you finally learned to do
what is necessary?

1311
02:03:38,326 --> 02:03:40,578
I won't kill you...

1312
02:03:45,041 --> 02:03:47,168
...but I don't have to save you.

1313
02:05:02,368 --> 02:05:05,455
- The meeting's already started.
- What meeting?

1314
02:05:09,709 --> 02:05:12,628
Fox, I seem to remember firing you.

1315
02:05:13,129 --> 02:05:14,672
You did.

1316
02:05:14,881 --> 02:05:16,924
I got another job.

1317
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:19,260
Yours.

1318
02:05:19,719 --> 02:05:21,429
On whose authority?

1319
02:05:22,055 --> 02:05:23,931
Batman may have made
the front page...

1320
02:05:24,182 --> 02:05:27,101
...but Bruce Wayne
got pushed to page eight.

1321
02:05:33,900 --> 02:05:34,901
Bruce Wayne.

1322
02:05:35,109 --> 02:05:38,863
What makes you think you can decide
who's running Wayne Enterprises?

1323
02:05:39,072 --> 02:05:41,824
- The fact that I'm the owner.
- What are you talking about?

1324
02:05:42,075 --> 02:05:43,951
The company went public a week ago.

1325
02:05:44,160 --> 02:05:45,620
And I bought most of the shares.

1326
02:05:45,995 --> 02:05:49,415
Through various charitable foundations
and trusts and so forth.

1327
02:05:49,624 --> 02:05:52,794
Look, it's all a bit technical,
but the important thing...

1328
02:05:53,044 --> 02:05:56,297
...is that my company's future
is secure.

1329
02:05:56,714 --> 02:05:58,091
Right, Mr. Fox?

1330
02:05:58,299 --> 02:06:00,093
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.

1331
02:06:02,345 --> 02:06:03,888
Didn't you get the memo?

1332
02:06:22,865 --> 02:06:26,035
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Rachel.
- No. No, Bruce...

1333
02:06:26,244 --> 02:06:27,620
...I'm sorry.

1334
02:06:28,496 --> 02:06:31,165
The day that Chill died, I...

1335
02:06:33,042 --> 02:06:34,669
I said terrible things.

1336
02:06:35,169 --> 02:06:36,879
But true things.

1337
02:06:37,547 --> 02:06:39,340
I was a coward with a gun...

1338
02:06:39,549 --> 02:06:43,302
...and justice is about more
than revenge, so thank you.

1339
02:06:44,387 --> 02:06:47,056
I never stopped thinking about you.

1340
02:06:48,558 --> 02:06:50,184
About us.

1341
02:06:50,810 --> 02:06:52,770
And when I heard you were back, I...

1342
02:06:53,604 --> 02:06:55,773
I started to hope.

1343
02:07:19,881 --> 02:07:22,550
But then I found out about your mask.

1344
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:26,596
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.

1345
02:07:27,221 --> 02:07:28,848
No. This...

1346
02:07:30,058 --> 02:07:31,768
...is your mask.

1347
02:07:33,728 --> 02:07:37,231
Your real face is the one
that criminals now fear.

1348
02:07:38,107 --> 02:07:40,068
The man I loved...

1349
02:07:40,818 --> 02:07:42,278
...the man who vanished...

1350
02:07:43,488 --> 02:07:45,615
...he never came back at all.

1351
02:07:50,119 --> 02:07:52,789
But maybe he's still
out there somewhere.

1352
02:07:54,957 --> 02:07:58,628
Maybe someday,
when Gotham no longer needs Batman...

1353
02:07:59,712 --> 02:08:01,672
...I'll see him again.

1354
02:08:12,725 --> 02:08:15,645
- Proved me wrong, you know.
- About what?

1355
02:08:18,481 --> 02:08:20,900
Your father would be
very proud of you.

1356
02:08:21,150 --> 02:08:22,777
Just like me.

1357
02:08:49,762 --> 02:08:51,639
What will you do?

1358
02:08:53,016 --> 02:08:54,559
Rebuild it.

1359
02:08:55,476 --> 02:08:57,812
Just the way it was, brick for brick.

1360
02:09:04,694 --> 02:09:05,903
Just the way it was, sir?

1361
02:09:08,031 --> 02:09:09,240
Yeah, why?

1362
02:09:09,449 --> 02:09:12,285
I thought this might be
a good opportunity for...

1363
02:09:12,452 --> 02:09:14,871
...improving the foundations.

1364
02:09:15,079 --> 02:09:17,999
- In the southeast corner?
- Precisely, sir.

1365
02:09:33,723 --> 02:09:36,559
- Nice.
- I couldn't find any mob bosses.

1366
02:09:37,560 --> 02:09:40,229
- Well, sergeant?
- It's "lieutenant" now.

1367
02:09:40,605 --> 02:09:42,065
You really started something.

1368
02:09:42,273 --> 02:09:44,233
Bent cops running scared.

1369
02:09:44,442 --> 02:09:45,818
Hope on the streets.

1370
02:09:46,110 --> 02:09:49,697
- But?
- The Narrows is lost.

1371
02:09:50,239 --> 02:09:54,077
And we still haven't picked up Crane or
half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.

1372
02:09:54,786 --> 02:09:56,412
We will.

1373
02:09:56,621 --> 02:09:58,247
We can bring Gotham back.

1374
02:09:58,456 --> 02:10:00,917
- What about escalation?
- Escalation?

1375
02:10:01,125 --> 02:10:05,421
We start carrying semiautomatics,
they buy automatics.

1376
02:10:05,630 --> 02:10:09,926
We start wearing Kevlar,
they buy armor-piercing rounds.

1377
02:10:10,134 --> 02:10:13,388
- And?
- And you're wearing a mask...

1378
02:10:13,846 --> 02:10:15,723
...and jumping off rooftops.

1379
02:10:17,141 --> 02:10:19,143
Now, take this guy.

1380
02:10:19,435 --> 02:10:21,437
Armed robbery, double homicide.

1381
02:10:21,646 --> 02:10:24,899
Got a taste for the theatrical, like you.

1382
02:10:25,149 --> 02:10:27,068
Leaves a calling card.

1383
02:10:32,990 --> 02:10:34,784
I'll look into it.

1384
02:10:38,287 --> 02:10:39,747
I never said thank you.

1385
02:10:44,836 --> 02:10:46,879
And you'll never have to.

1386
02:11:00,050 --> 02:12:00,666
