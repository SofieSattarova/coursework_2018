1
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,110
Come on, Alejandro!
It is my turn!

2
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,200
Let me see.

3
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,220
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

4
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,960
Hey! What are you doing
cutting holes in my wagon?

5
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,760
I am sorry. Señor Lopez.
We were just waiting for Zorro.

6
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,500
Go home, muchachos.

7
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,270
Do you think he is really
going to come, Señor Lopez?

8
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,970
Someone thinks he will.

9
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,130
Joaquin, Alejandro,

10
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,330
once I carved coffins
for your mother and father.

11
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,910
I would hate to carve one for you.

12
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,210
Now, go!

13
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,940
Alejandro, Joaquin...

14
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,090
This no place for you.
Now get back to the mission.

15
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,290
Come on!

16
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,920
Don Montero, for the love of god,
why are you still here?

17
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,710
Now, now, Don Luiz.
Calm, calm.

18
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,020
Santa Anna's men are three miles
from the town.

19
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,100
You have to go, sir.
Now.

20
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:05,010
The government of Spain would like
to thank you for your devoted service.

21
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,140
This land is the property
of the Spanish government.

22
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,050
And in two hours' time it will be the
property of the Mexican government...

23
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,630
unless I hand them over to you.

24
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,920
I am well acquainted
with Santa Anna.

25
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,350
He will realize that the dons
will be dutiful taxpayers...

26
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,830
and he will respect your claims.

27
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:32,750
The rest of Alta California I have
divided up equally among the other dons.

28
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,760
I trust that you will make sure
that all of them receive their grants.

29
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,800
Get the children
out of the plaza immediately.

30
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,100
The children should never
have to see the things we do.

31
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,690
I want to see!

32
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,380
Put me down.

33
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,180
Zorro?

34
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,170
I saw him.

35
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,050
I saw Zorro. Come here.

36
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,980
Who are these men that you would
risk your life to have them killed?

37
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,110
Who are they?
No idea!

38
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,410
Three peasants pulled
at random from the crowd.

39
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,560
Where is he?

40
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,330
Go.

41
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,540
Come on.

42
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,590
My thanks to you gentlemen.

43
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,940
Now, if you will excuse me,

44
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,820
I'm missing my own party.

45
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,320
Kill him!

46
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,930
You would murder three innocent men
just to capture me?

47
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,130
I would murder a hundred innocent men
if it meant killing you.

48
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,480
Three men, three-cuts.

49
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,730
A small memento of Mexico, Rafael...

50
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,570
to remind you not to return.

51
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,320
Tornado, my old friend,

52
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,110
you're getting too old for this.

53
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,370
Yes, me too.

54
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,850
Is she warm enough?

55
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,750
I always put on an
extra blanket for you, Señor.

56
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,220
But the good prince
was not afraid of the evil king.

57
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,720
He raced across the drawbridge,
fighting off a hundred guards.

58
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,330
And then, looking very handsome
and dashing in the late afternoon sun...

59
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,410
he leapt onto the balcony...

60
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,870
and thrust his enchanted sword
under the king's chin.

61
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,440
"You would kill three innocent men,"
he demanded, "just to capture me?"

62
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,170
"Yes. "

63
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:19,420
Then suddenly, lightning flashed and
a mighty thunder shocked the wasted land.

64
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:24,500
And the evil king glared
at the good prince and said--

65
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,230
Something very forgettable.

66
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,790
And the good prince?
What did he do?

67
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,390
Well, he leapt from the balcony onto
his faithful old steed Tornado and...

68
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,980
raced home to
his beautiful wife Esperanza...

69
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,770
and to his little child, Elena...

70
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,400
never to do anything so foolish
or dangerous again.

71
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,500
She loves to hear your stories.

72
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,410
Oh, It's only
the sound of my voice.

73
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,610
One day she'll have
no time for them.

74
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,660
I never tire of them.
Why should she?

75
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,210
Esperanza...

76
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,670
- She already has your strength.
- Uh-huh

77
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,770
Today she broke the little clay horse
you made for her.

78
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,350
Diego...

79
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,110
It's just a scratch.
It's all right.

80
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,690
- Diego. you promised me.
- I know.

81
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,150
No more nights waiting up,
praying you'll come home alive.

82
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,840
The Spaniards are going home.

83
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,480
Today is Zorro's last ride.

84
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,760
From now on we'll grow old together
with our five children.

85
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,440
Five?

86
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,070
Yeah.

87
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,240
Not enough?

88
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,030
I love you.

89
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,310
Doña de la Vega,

90
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,850
still as beautiful as ever.

91
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,410
Don Rafael, what an honour!

92
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,340
The governor in my home.

93
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,720
You will stay for dinner,
of course.

94
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,780
I have come to apologize,
Esperanza.

95
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,030
I'm sorry that I could not
protect this country...

96
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,010
from the peasants
who have overrun it.

97
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,460
I'm sorry that
I couldn't make you love me.

98
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,770
And I'm sorry that I have
to leave you without a husband.

99
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,100
Arrest him.

100
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,770
Blood never lies...

101
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,900
Zorro.

102
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,660
You're a traitor to your country
and your class.

103
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,560
Take him away.

104
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,220
Wait!

105
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:50,700
No!

106
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,100
I would never have let
any harm come to her.

107
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,610
She was never yours
to protect.

108
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:21,800
Elena...

109
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,650
I want you to live...

110
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,820
with the knowledge
you have lost everything you hold dear.

111
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,730
I want you to suffer
as I have suffered...

112
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,930
knowing that your child
should have been mine.

113
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,330
Elena!

114
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,630
Elena!

115
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,600
Let me hold her.

116
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,460
Let me hold her!

117
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,200
Rafael!

118
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,560
She has her mother's eyes.

119
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,190
Rafael...

120
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,060
You'll never be rid of me!

121
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,160
Rafael!

122
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:10,150
¶ Caught the bandits, plain to see ¶

123
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,920
¶ They're tough and they're mean
But don't scare me ¶

124
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:29,330
¶ Stayed on their track
Bringing them back ¶

125
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,590
¶ So pay the bounty now to me ¶

126
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,820
¶ 'Cause ¶

127
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,540
¶ 'Cause ¶

128
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:48,690
¶ Nobody's tough as Jack
Nobody's tough as Jack ¶

129
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,950
Now you're gettin' there.

130
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,880
Like I done told ya,

131
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,030
Singin' can lighten your terrible load.

132
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,010
Hey, hey, hey!

133
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,130
Come one! come all!

134
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,420
For the fright of your life!

135
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,020
See the notorious Murrieta brothers.

136
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,970
Robbers! Horse thieves!

137
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,490
Bandits! people of
the worst sort! Hey!

138
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,910
Gather around!

139
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,860
Garcia.

140
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,270
It's the Murrieta brothers.

141
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,400
Get over here.
you mangy trash.

142
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,810
May I, friend?

143
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:06,330
These men are now in the custody
of Corporal Armando Garcia...

144
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,470
and we will take them
the rest of the way.

145
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,760
And you can claim your bounty
in Tlaxco.

146
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,350
Yeah, when bulls
start wearing' bloomers.

147
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,470
- How much are we worth?
- Get out.

148
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,020
All figured out...

149
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,960
about 200 pesos.

150
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,260
200 pesos? That's it?

151
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,550
After all the payrolls we've robbed?

152
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,400
A lousy 200 pesos apiece!
That's all we're worth?

153
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,830
- We're wasting time.
- That's 200 pesos for the both of ya.

154
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:32,980
What?

155
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,250
Are you crazy?
Don't take it, Jack!

156
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,250
Back out there!

157
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,490
Touch my brother again,

158
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,230
and I'll kill you.

159
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,920
Yes, he will.

160
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,710
Hey, I thought you were tied up.

161
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,570
That's because you're stupid.

162
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,210
Drop it! Drop it!

163
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:04,540
Hey!

164
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,940
They got a strongbox
on the wagon.

165
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,330
We know. That's why we came.

166
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,390
Lousy 200 pesos.
That cheats.

167
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,900
It is a fact, that I, the legendary
Three-Fingered Jack, ain't even mentioned.

168
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,770
I ain't even mentioned.

169
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:29,680
And ain't I the one that figured to
kidnap the mayor from his own outhouse?

170
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,500
I tell you,
I am the holy guts of this gang.

171
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,890
Without me,
the whole dang opera falls apart.

172
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,150
Amigos, adiós.

173
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:48,290
- Come on. Come on.
- Go! Go!

174
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,630
- Joaquin, Joaquin! Come on, come on.
- Go! Go.

175
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,100
Come on! Get up! Get up!

176
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,250
Go.

177
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,340
Go.

178
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,170
I want you to know...

179
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,060
I consider this an honor.

180
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,980
Bury the body.
Bag the head.

181
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,430
Of course
I have feelings for you.

182
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:49,280
Yes. Yes.

183
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,940
But quick. Hide in the barn.

184
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,330
He's coming.

185
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,860
What do you want?
Please! Don't touch me!

186
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,020
What do you want?
Who are you?

187
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,320
Don Rafael!

188
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,280
Listen to me.

189
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:16,450
If any one of you is
or ever was that masked man...

190
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,690
all dressed in black
known as Zorro...

191
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,990
Reveal himself now.

192
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,430
I am Zorro!

193
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,500
They took my mask.

194
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,500
My sword, my horse!
- Silence!

195
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:32,780
You old fool!
I am Zorro!

196
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,750
I am the man you want!

197
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,340
- I am the original!
- Liar!

198
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,270
- Liar!
- The first!

199
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:40,110
- I am the root!
- Anyone can see you are too tall!

200
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,210
I am the first!

201
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,010
I am Zorro!

202
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:29,590
Get him out of here
before he starts to stink.

203
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,540
Did you find him?

204
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,030
He's dead.

205
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,950
Back to the boat. I need some sleep
before landing tomorrow.

206
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,790
The governor has returned!

207
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,600
Luiz.

208
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,840
Welcome home, Rafael.

209
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,670
It has been too long.

210
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,100
Too long, my friend.

211
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,530
You said once
you favored me above all.

212
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,170
Consider this a fool's apology
for ever doubting you.

213
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,650
Come.

214
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,040
A crowd has gathered to greet you.

215
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:32,330
- Don Pedro.
- Don Rafael, welcome.

216
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,130
- You're looking well.
- Thank you.

217
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,070
- Don Hector.
- Welcome back, sir.

218
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:38,570
Don Julio.

219
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,540
Gentlemen.

220
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:50,080
Please! please!

221
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,950
I know that you are not
really happy to see me.

222
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,980
So let us all stop pretending,
shall we?

223
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,280
You think I don't know
that you've been paid,

224
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,000
even threatened to come out
in the hot sun and greet me?

225
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,770
I understand exactly how you feel.

226
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,440
Why should you care about
any of your leaders, past or present?

227
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,940
What did they ever do for you?

228
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,770
The Spaniards oppressed you.

229
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,020
The Mexicans ignored you.

230
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,920
And the dons?
Well, the dons, the dons.

231
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,020
The dons seem merely content
to cheat and lie to you.

232
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,860
In fact, I put it to you.

233
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,890
Who in your entire history
has ever helped you?

234
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:41,330
Zorro!
Zorro fought for the people.

235
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,670
Ah, yes, Zorro.

236
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,770
Where is he now, Padre...

237
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,010
your masked friend?

238
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:58,050
Unless I'm mistaken,
he hasn't shown himself in 20 years.

239
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,350
Twenty years!

240
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,220
People of California...

241
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,620
The time has come to take
our destiny into our own hands...

242
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:11,100
Not as Spaniards,
not as Mexicans...

243
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,120
but as Californians!

244
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:23,950
I stand here before you today
with no mask...

245
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,650
only a pledge...

246
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,460
a solemn pledge
that I will never abandon you.

247
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,030
And you have my word,

248
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,330
the word of Rafael Montero...

249
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,120
that I will do everything
within my power to help you fight...

250
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,160
for a free and
independent California!

251
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:53,970
Father!

252
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:03,220
Gentlemen, allow me
to introduce my daughter, Elena.

253
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:12,450
Thank you.

254
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,770
Can anyone tell me what this flower is?
I knows this scent.

255
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:21,660
Señor, Señorita. It’s called Romania,
(<i>Correct name: Romneya</i>)

256
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,590
but it only grows in California.

257
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,610
And I believe this is
your first visit to our shores.

258
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,530
Yes.

259
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:59,000
Hey, hey...
More whiskey...

260
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,670
or whatever you call this.

261
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,470
I don't want to see
the bottom of this glass, huh?

262
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,620
Money first.

263
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,490
Hey, hey, hey! Wait, wait, wait!

264
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:18,640
- What about this?
- Silver!

265
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,490
Of course, silver.
The finest.

266
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,490
Where did you get that?

267
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,770
It’s none of your business.

268
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,130
Where did you get it?

269
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,270
It was my brother's.

270
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:43,370
He's dead.

271
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,810
I'm sorry.

272
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,030
You're sorry?
Why should you be sorry?

273
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,090
You should not trade something like that
for a mere glass of whiskey.

274
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,380
Why not?
You think I could get two?

275
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,470
Who's that?

276
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,620
That's the man
who killed my brother.

277
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,670
You're drunk and angry, in no condition
to fight a professional soldier.

278
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,910
Get out of my way, you old man.

279
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,310
Would you care to try again?

280
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,750
You're welcome.

281
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,480
For what?

282
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,840
For saving your life.

283
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,810
- I would have killed him.
- No, not today.

284
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:15,250
He is trained to kill.
You seem trained to drink.

285
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:19,100
Yes, my friend, you would have fought
very bravely and died very quickly.

286
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,850
Who, then, would avenge
your brother?

287
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:27,540
I would have found a way.
I've never lost a fight.

288
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,740
Except to a crippled old man,
just now.

289
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,980
What is your name?

290
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,780
- Alejandro.
- Alejandro.

291
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,580
You know, there is a saying,
a very old saying.

292
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,760
"When the pupil is ready,
the master will appear."

293
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:46,120
Have you want to kill this man,
I can help you.

294
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,050
I can teach you how,
how to move, how to think...

295
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:51,350
how to take your revenge with honor
and live to celebrate it.

296
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:54,240
But it will take dedication.
It will take time.

297
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,720
Why are you so eager to help me?

298
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,570
Because once, a long time ago...

299
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:04,980
You did the same for me.

300
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:17,320
I can't believe it.

301
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,170
I never thought that one day...

302
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,520
I would be standing
in the lair of the fox...

303
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,970
in the lair of Zorro.

304
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,200
Yeah...

305
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,180
this place was devoted
to the training of Zorro.

306
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:37,820
Where were you all these years?
I thought you were dead.

307
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,680
I was dead,
and we will leave it at that.

308
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:54,620
I remember the last time
I saw you in the square...

309
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:56,680
fighting a hundred men.

310
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:59,200
- A hundred men?
- I do not forget.

311
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:02,640
You were the greatest swordsman
who ever lived. Yes.

312
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,310
Rafael Montero was
the governor of California, then.

313
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:08,640
Do you remember him?

314
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:11,770
What?

315
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:15,210
Rafael Montero.
Do you remember him?

316
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:20,520
Yes. His soldiers killed many...

317
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,020
and...

318
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,200
he was
the sworn enemy of Zorro.

319
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,120
That's you.

320
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,390
Montero's come back.

321
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,730
Good. Then you can kill him.

322
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:35,120
No, there are complications.
Too many complications for me to ignore.

323
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,970
What complications?

324
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:47,830
I can see we're not
gonna spend much time talking.

325
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,790
Montero has some plan,
some design for California.

326
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,880
Otherwise, he would not have retained
the services of your Captain Love.

327
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:59,590
We must find out
what that design is.

328
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:00,950
And then what?

329
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,490
Oh, If you are ready...

330
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,320
We will both tempt our fates.

331
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:08,380
Let's go, then!

332
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:15,170
Do you know how
to use that thing?

333
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:16,970
Yes.

334
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,580
The pointy end
goes into the other man.

335
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:22,870
Yeah.

336
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,860
This is going
to take a lot of work.

337
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:31,270
This is called a training circle.
a master's wheel.

338
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,080
This circle will be your world,
your whole life.

339
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,790
Till I tell you otherwise,
there is nothing outside of it.

340
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:43,290
- Capitan Love is out...
- There is nothing... outside of it.

341
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,700
Captain Love does not exist
until I say he exists.

342
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,440
As your skill
with a sword improves...

343
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:58,550
you will progress
to a smaller circle.

344
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,280
With each new circle,
your world contracts...

345
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,990
Bringing you that much closer to your adversary,
that much closer to your to retribution.

346
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,020
I like that part.

347
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,360
Shall we?

348
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:32,840
Slow!

349
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,270
Attack slowly.

350
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:38,530
Attack! Slow! Again!

351
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:43,020
Slow! Let's try and...
Slow, like...

352
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:43,990
Good.

353
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:45,560
Good.

354
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,250
- That is good.
- Thank you.

355
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:49,290
Attack.

356
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,370
Good!

357
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:58,070
Time for a drink.

358
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,320
Perfect. Do it again.

359
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,970
One, five, three!

360
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,550
Six, four, two!

361
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,210
And lunge!

362
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,580
Over-lunged!

363
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,120
Lesson number one:
Never attack in anger.

364
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,440
Lesson number two?

365
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,620
Come with me.

366
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:07,890
What?

367
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,580
So, what is lesson number three?

368
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,850
To get to lesson number four.

369
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:48,900
Again?

370
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,320
Whoa. Whoa.

371
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,400
Black Andalusian.

372
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,730
Magnificent.

373
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,840
Looks like your old horse,
Tornado.

374
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,040
Quiet. Quiet.

375
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:11,390
Damn horse!

376
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:14,090
What are you doing, huh?
What are you doing?!

377
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:18,680
I'll see you tonight.

378
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:44,060
Zorro... you look better than ever.

379
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:12,310
Be careful, Señorita.

380
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:15,020
There are dangerous men about.

381
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:16,690
Well...

382
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,570
if you see any,
be sure to point them out.

383
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:14,700
Everybody's in!
Don't worry, then.

384
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,160
Listen.

385
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:40,390
I'm going to give you
the great honor...

386
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,230
of being my horse.

387
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:03,320
We are like one spirit.

388
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,800
Damn it! Damn it, stop!

389
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,020
Go! Go, go, go!

390
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,650
Get him!

391
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:44,670
Kill him.

392
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:24,810
Zorro!
The legend has returned!

393
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,380
Don't yell.

394
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:12,690
I need sanctuary, Father.
You don't know me, so...

395
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:14,860
Zorro?
Of course I know you.

396
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:20,230
Zorro, is it really you? I must say, the years
have been far kinder to you than to me.

397
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:22,000
I'm sorry. I have no time
to talk now.

398
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,000
Father, please, hide me.

399
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:26,970
Come.

400
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,670
It’s just like the old days.

401
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,950
<i>Padre, is that you?</i>

402
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:49,410
Padre, is everything all right? It sounds
like there is a battle going on out there.

403
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:52,210
Don't worry, my dear.

404
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:55,230
You are safe
in the house of the Lord.

405
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:57,480
<i>Of course, Padre. </i>

406
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:00,740
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

407
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:02,840
It has been three days
since my last confession.

408
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:02,850
Three days?
It has been three days
since my last confession.

409
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:03,940
Three days?

410
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,770
How many sins could you have
committed in three days?

411
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:07,800
Come back when you have
more time, please.

412
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:10,180
Excuse me?

413
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,170
Listen, Señorita...

414
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:17,820
Continue, please...

415
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:20,280
go on.

416
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:23,690
I have broken
the fourth commandment, Padre.

417
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:28,080
- You killed somebody?
- No, that is not the fourth commandment.

418
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,470
Of course not.

419
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:31,890
You... you...

420
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:36,000
In what way did you break
the most sacred...

421
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:37,670
of commandments?

422
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,840
I dishonored my father.

423
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:45,280
That is not so bad.
Maybe your father deserved it.

424
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:46,570
What did you say?

425
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:51,750
I said, tell me more, my child.

426
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:54,520
Well, I try to behave properly...

427
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:56,460
the way my father
would like me to...

428
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,550
but I'm afraid
my heart is too wild.

429
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:02,350
- Too wild?
- Yes.

430
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:06,170
Could you be
a little more specific about that?

431
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,970
I had impure thoughts about a man.

432
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:14,050
I did. I think he was a bandit or
something. He wore a black mask.

433
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:19,580
He had... a deep voice?

434
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:21,810
Yes.

435
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,210
Ruggedly handsome?

436
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,190
I do not know.
His face was half-covered.

437
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:31,620
But something in his eyes
captured me.

438
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:33,620
Captured you.

439
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:37,260
I felt warm and feverish.

440
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:40,100
Lustful?

441
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,130
Yes. Lustful.

442
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:50,040
Forgive me.

443
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:56,180
I forgive you.

444
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,950
Look over there,
by the altar!

445
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:06,260
Go the other way.
He has to be here.

446
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,660
Search everything.

447
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:11,630
The chapel, the loft,
the rectory, all of it.

448
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:13,500
This is a house of God.

449
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:17,200
Don't worry, Padre.
We'll be gone by the time he gets back.

450
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:24,510
Señorita,
you have done nothing wrong.

451
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:29,190
The only sin would be to deny
what your heart truly feels.

452
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:31,480
Now, go.

453
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:36,480
Elena!

454
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,700
- What are you doing here?
- I was confessing.

455
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:47,040
- Confessing?
- Yes.

456
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:50,020
To whom?
The priest is here.

457
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,240
Stand back, Elena.

458
00:55:56,670 --> 00:55:57,540
Please.

459
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,640
Out of respect for Miss Montero...

460
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:21,210
I'll deal with you later.

461
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:33,050
Horse! Come here!

462
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:40,570
Blackie! Thunder!

463
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:45,390
Storm! Stupido!
Get over here now!

464
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:51,490
I warn you.
I'll get another horse.

465
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:02,230
So...

466
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:04,760
what do you think?

467
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,230
Sir. Sir.

468
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:14,890
I got the black stallion.
I carved a "Z" in the...

469
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:20,900
Don Diego, the people will be
speaking the name of Zorro again.

470
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:25,760
You think stealing a horse and scratching marks on the wall
makes you worthy enough to wear that mask?

471
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:30,120
Be careful.

472
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:35,690
You're a thief, Alejandro.

473
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:37,860
A pitiful clown.

474
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:42,870
Zorro was a servant of the people.
He was not a seeker of fame like you.

475
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:45,580
A buffoon.

476
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:50,340
Zorro did what was needed.

477
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:51,970
And now he's needed again.

478
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:57,080
I didn't ask for your help
in the cantina...

479
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:00,780
but I came here
to learn how to fight like you...

480
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:03,660
to have your strength,
your courage.

481
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:07,720
Now, when I try to use them,
you slap me down?

482
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:14,700
Let me tell you something, I am tired
of all your training, your lecturing,

483
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:18,840
tired of waiting for you
to tell me I am ready.

484
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:22,640
I have my own scores to settle...

485
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:24,940
a new life to find.

486
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,570
I thought I could do it here...

487
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:30,980
but I was wrong.

488
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:34,070
Alejandro!

489
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:36,590
En garde!

490
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:42,950
Choose your weapon.

491
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,200
Montero has invited
every don in California...

492
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,180
to a banquet at his hacienda.

493
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,150
If you want to be of service,
you can join them as a spy.

494
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:16,600
I think I do not understand, sir.

495
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:20,540
You have passion, Alejandro,
and your skill is growing...

496
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,660
but to enter Montero's world
I must give you something...

497
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:26,030
which is completely
beyond your reach.

498
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:28,290
Oh, yes?
And what is that?

499
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Charm.

500
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:33,570
And what is that?

501
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,750
Convince Montero
that you're a gentleman of stature...

502
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,430
and he will let you
into his circle.

503
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,320
Me?

504
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:51,590
A gentleman?

505
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:56,320
This is going to take a lot of work.

506
01:00:58,760 --> 01:00:59,580
Yes.

507
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,880
Look at me.
I Look like a butterfly.

508
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:24,620
This is the most stupid thing
I've ever done.

509
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:25,660
I doubt that.

510
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:28,360
- We'll never get away with this.
- Yes, we will.

511
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:32,570
A nobleman is nothing but a man
who says one thing...

512
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:34,060
and thinks another.

513
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,370
What if Montero realizes who you are?

514
01:01:36,970 --> 01:01:39,070
Montero thinks of himself
as a true nobleman.

515
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:41,790
He will never Look a servant
in the eye.

516
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:44,070
Listen to me.

517
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:45,640
Listen to me!

518
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:50,850
The most important thing of all...

519
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:54,180
Do not let the dons
leave the table without you.

520
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:56,250
- Yes.
- Good.

521
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:58,820
And good luck tonight.

522
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,020
Thank you.

523
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:03,060
Stand up straight.

524
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:05,290
Charm.

525
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:07,490
Charm.

526
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,200
Don Rafael Montero?

527
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,360
Good evening.

528
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:32,520
l am Don Alejandro
del Castillo y Garcia.

529
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:35,230
Formal greeting
of the Spanish court.

530
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:36,760
I've not seen that in years.

531
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:41,010
My father was very strict
in matter of etiquette.

532
01:02:41,330 --> 01:02:42,530
Who is your father?

533
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:44,430
Don Bartolo del Castillo.

534
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:48,600
I have heard of Don Bartolo, but I've
never had a pleasure to meet him.

535
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:51,940
I arrived last week from Spain...

536
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:54,780
by way of Paris, Lisbon
and San Francisco.

537
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:57,480
I am inspecting
my family's holdings.

538
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:06,890
Queen Isabella of Spain
has been very generous to us.

539
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,620
Very impressive.
What brings you to my door?

540
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:15,230
When I heard you were
back in California...

541
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:17,260
I knew I must introduce myself.

542
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:20,230
Her Royal Highness
speaks very highly of you.

543
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:23,500
Really?

544
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:27,570
I was under the impression I was
out of favor with the Spanish court...

545
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:29,640
Since California was lost to Mexico.

546
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:37,950
Only in certain circles.

547
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:42,560
Her Majesty knows those unfortunate
events were clearly no fault of yours.

548
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:47,810
She also told me this province
is still a Land of opportunity...

549
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:49,040
For a man of vision.

550
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,700
And you are a man of vision?

551
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:56,200
I am a man in search of a vision.

552
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:01,170
But my timing is unfortunate.

553
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:03,180
I have interrupted a party.

554
01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:05,410
Perhaps I could call again?

555
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:10,020
No, no. It would honor me
for you to join us.

556
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,180
It would honor me to do so, sir.

557
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:17,020
Please allow me
to introduce my daughter, Elena.

558
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:17,760
Of course.

559
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:22,960
Charmed.

560
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:30,290
I'm afraid I have brought no gift
for the hostess.

561
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:33,730
But... wait a moment.

562
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,650
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

563
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:57,810
Bernardo, pick up your feet.
Señorita. Caballero.

564
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:24,820
Don Alejandro.

565
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:29,880
My father and I would like you
to join us at our table.

566
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,430
I would be delighted, Señorita.

567
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,910
Ah, Don Alejandro,
I'm so pleased you could join us.

568
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:52,920
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce
Don Alejandro del Castillo y Garcia...

569
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:54,680
Recently returned from Spain.

570
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:58,780
And this is Captain Harrison Love.

571
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:01,420
Not a don,
but certainly a kindred spirit.

572
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:07,800
Are you not the man who was
chasing a Legendary bandit recently?

573
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:09,860
He was hardly legendary.

574
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,260
So you caught him?

575
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:14,270
It’s only a matter of time.

576
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:18,210
Well, the bandit may have escaped...

577
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:21,040
But the rest of us
will certainly thinks twice...

578
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:22,630
Before going to confession.

579
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:46,490
Oh...

580
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:48,330
Thank you.

581
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:54,700
With all due respect,
Don Hector, I disagree.

582
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:57,910
Until these people
are free to govern themselves...

583
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:01,400
I think we will see many more ''Z''s
carved into walls.

584
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:05,300
Don Alejandro,
what do you think?

585
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:08,690
I think...

586
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:12,360
Sheep will always need a shepherd...

587
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:17,000
But certainly not
this Zorro creature.

588
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,070
He probably wears the mask to hide
his bald head and unsightly features.

589
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:29,070
There are some
who would call him heroic.

590
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:31,640
Heroism.
A romantic illusion.

591
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,830
- Much like nobility.
- Elena, that is enough.

592
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:38,790
Myself, I would think heroism is
something to aspire to, not sneer at.

593
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:40,950
All that playing with swords...

594
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:43,650
shooting guns,
racing around with horses...

595
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:45,990
gives me a frightful headache.

596
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:49,700
Such sweaty pursuits are hardly
the work of a gentleman.

597
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:53,000
And what is?
Climbing in and out of carriages?

598
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:54,470
No, my dear.

599
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,560
But increasing one's holdings
so as to provide lavish comfort...

600
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:01,840
for young ladies...
such as yourself.

601
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,020
A woman's grasp of politics.
What can I say?

602
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,920
Well, we're at a party,
aren't we?

603
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:18,930
Elena...

604
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:21,420
may I have the honor
of this dance?

605
01:08:24,990 --> 01:08:26,130
I would be glad to.

606
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:17,610
Yes?... Were you
looking for something?

607
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:21,520
A sense of the miraculous
in everyday life.

608
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:25,950
Oh, really. Well, why don't you
try looking someplace else?

609
01:09:25,950 --> 01:09:27,660
The lady and I were trying to dance.

610
01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:29,160
You were trying.

611
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:31,550
She was succeeding.

612
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:34,670
Forgive me, Capitan.

613
01:09:35,350 --> 01:09:37,330
A shameless joke at your expense...

614
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,210
And I hope it will not be the last.

615
01:09:40,030 --> 01:09:42,500
Don Rafael wants you
back at his table... now.

616
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:33,050
Would you care to try
something more robust?

617
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,180
Or do you feel unequal
to the task?

618
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:37,320
No, on the contrary,
Don Alejandro.

619
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:40,560
I think only of your distaste
for perspiration.

620
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:43,560
Maestro.

621
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:13,380
Well, that is the way
they are dancing in Madrid these days.

622
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:17,250
Excuse me, Don Rafael.
I need to catch my breath.

623
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,050
Your daughter is
a very spirited dancer.

624
01:12:20,990 --> 01:12:24,540
"Spirited". Thank you
for putting it so delicately.

625
01:12:30,230 --> 01:12:31,970
I apologize if you were offended.

626
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:35,230
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Completely unnecessary, I assure you.

627
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:37,800
She is young and impulsive.

628
01:12:38,170 --> 01:12:40,170
But her beauty is beyond compare...

629
01:12:40,270 --> 01:12:42,980
And she has her father's
commanding presence.

630
01:12:46,010 --> 01:12:47,010
Don Rafael!

631
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:55,390
As an advisor to Her Royal Highness
in matters of finance...

632
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:59,200
It would be my pleasure
to introduce you both at court.

633
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:13,540
Join us in the courtyard. There's
something I'd Like to share with you.

634
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:15,600
What is that?

635
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:17,340
A vision.

636
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:29,990
Fellow dons of California...

637
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:35,050
All of us here can recall the golden
years when we ruled this country.

638
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:40,100
We commanded respect as nobleman,
and we amassed a great deal of wealth...

639
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:42,640
but there was something
we never achieved.

640
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:46,810
We never determined
our own destiny.

641
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:50,740
Well, the time has come.

642
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,910
Time to claim what always
should have been ours.

643
01:13:54,850 --> 01:13:55,780
My friends...

644
01:13:57,650 --> 01:14:02,730
I give you the independent
Republic of California.

645
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:19,410
Don Rafael...

646
01:14:20,650 --> 01:14:22,300
every man here
owes you something.

647
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:25,420
The land you gave us
made us all wealthy men.

648
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:28,850
However,
we must question your motives.

649
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:33,450
The day you arrived on the beach,
you made us all look like fools.

650
01:14:33,950 --> 01:14:36,820
That is absurd, Don Pedro.
I was merely playing to the crowd.

651
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:39,860
And what are you doing now
if not "playing to the crowd"?

652
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:44,600
Now you're inciting us
to raise arms against Santa Anna...

653
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:48,220
when you know perfectly well
we could never defeat his army.

654
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:51,160
I was not suggesting
that we fight him for California.

655
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,340
I was suggesting
that we buy it from him.

656
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:58,770
Santa Anna is waging a very expensive
war with the United States...

657
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:00,700
and is increasingly short of money.

658
01:15:01,610 --> 01:15:03,880
Even if we all
combined our fortunes...

659
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:07,890
we could not come up with enough money
to buy this country from Santa Anna.

660
01:15:08,590 --> 01:15:10,880
I have already
brokered a deal with him.

661
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,230
You're living in a dream, Montero.

662
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:18,900
And why don't we all live
in the same dream together?

663
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,310
Meet me here tomorrow morning,
gentlemen...

664
01:15:37,310 --> 01:15:41,250
for a journey that will open your eyes
and laid all your doubts to rest.

665
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:36,760
My friends, I give you...

666
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,700
El Dorado!

667
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:53,640
Technically, of course,
all this gold belongs to Santa Anna...

668
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:57,040
but fortunately for us, he's
completely unaware of it's existence.

669
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:00,340
Now, for the deception to work,
all these bars...

670
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:04,130
have been marked with the Spanish seal
so he'll think they've come from Spain.

671
01:17:05,570 --> 01:17:07,730
You see now, gentlemen?
Is it becoming clearer to you?

672
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:12,310
Two days from now we will
buy this country from Santa Anna...

673
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:16,510
And we will buy it with gold
dug from his own land.

674
01:17:27,450 --> 01:17:28,970
Where did you find all these people?

675
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,130
Anywhere we wanted.

676
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:34,750
Brilliant.

677
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:37,760
Brilliant.

678
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:43,370
It’s only part of the mining process.

679
01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:47,940
At first we were just picking it up
off the ground, but now we're down blasting.

680
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:06,310
So, this is the future
of California, huh?

681
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:09,700
This is my vision, yes.

682
01:18:14,370 --> 01:18:15,370
Up here!

683
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:19,750
Well, now ain't you
a sight for sore eyes.

684
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:24,480
Full-grown vultures
walking' around like real folks.

685
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:26,210
Welcome!

686
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:29,020
Welcome to hell's outhouse.

687
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,280
They call us
"the disappeared ones. "

688
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:35,900
But, as you can see,
we ain't exactly disappeared.

689
01:18:35,990 --> 01:18:38,420
- We just been a little hard to find.
- Wait!

690
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:41,400
You. I know you.

691
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,290
You bet you do, peckerwood.

692
01:18:43,470 --> 01:18:46,080
I'm the legendary
Three-Fingered Jack...

693
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:49,660
And you are
a bunch of murdering' trash...

694
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:54,160
Dressed up in fancy,
sweet-smelling' doodads.

695
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:57,270
Ignore him, gentlemen.
He's a common thief.

696
01:18:57,370 --> 01:19:00,110
Huh! As common as they come.

697
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:03,990
But I ain't nothing'
compared to you, gentlemen.

698
01:19:04,390 --> 01:19:07,090
I steal gold.
I steal money.

699
01:19:07,450 --> 01:19:11,420
But you,
you steal people's lives.

700
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,220
So damn ya...

701
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:15,520
and damn the horse that brung ya!

702
01:19:35,490 --> 01:19:36,440
"Peckerwood"?

703
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:22,320
Is there something amusing to you?

704
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:24,960
Strange, I'd say.

705
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:29,830
That's the second time I've shot this man
while he was flying through the air.

706
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:39,850
Don Alejandro!

707
01:20:41,410 --> 01:20:43,890
I need to speak with you
at the hacienda... alone.

708
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,050
Some other time, perhaps.

709
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:48,350
Today.

710
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:50,080
Alone.

711
01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:14,900
Good afternoon, Bernardo.

712
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:18,680
Good afternoon, Señorita.

713
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:21,610
Your voice is so calming.

714
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,950
He's high-spirited.
He needs to hear something soothing.

715
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:26,620
Yes, I understand.

716
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:32,290
How long have you served
Don Alejandro?

717
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:35,130
Sometimes it seems interminable.

718
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:38,390
- I'm sorry. I speak out of place.
- Do not worry, Bernardo.

719
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:39,860
He will not hear it from me.

720
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:44,860
Don Alejandro confuses me.

721
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:50,510
Sometimes he seems so arrogant,
so superior.

722
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:54,710
And yet the way
that he looks at me and...

723
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:56,650
the way that he dances with me...

724
01:21:58,020 --> 01:22:00,220
As if he were two
completely different man.

725
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:01,600
Yes.

726
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:12,500
You look so much like your mother.

727
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:16,830
How would you know that?

728
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:18,430
Well...

729
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:22,970
I don't see much
of Don Rafael in you.

730
01:22:25,550 --> 01:22:27,930
I know my father wishes
I acted more like her.

731
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:32,060
She was very proper, my mother.
Always appropriate.

732
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:34,540
Is that how he describes her?

733
01:22:34,910 --> 01:22:37,760
Yes. But sometimes
I do not believe him.

734
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:39,630
She was more like you.

735
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:42,920
Perhaps.

736
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:46,010
It would be a way
of knowing her.

737
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:52,270
My ninera once told me...

738
01:22:52,340 --> 01:22:54,700
That the departed
can see you in the moonlight.

739
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:59,080
So when I was young I used to
sneak out at my window at night...

740
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:01,700
And ride my horse across Andalusia...

741
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:05,820
And wave at the sky
so she would know it was me.

742
01:23:11,650 --> 01:23:12,850
How did she die?

743
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:14,640
Giving birth to me.

744
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:20,600
My father rarely speaks of her.
I think he finds it too painful.

745
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:23,830
Yes.

746
01:23:31,010 --> 01:23:33,810
I know what it is like
to losing a loved one.

747
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:35,540
You?

748
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:39,080
Yes. A daughter.

749
01:23:40,010 --> 01:23:41,150
Long ago.

750
01:23:43,650 --> 01:23:47,490
When I see you, I remember
what it felt like to be a father.

751
01:23:52,590 --> 01:23:55,300
I'm sure your mother would be
very proud of you, Señorita.

752
01:23:56,330 --> 01:23:57,330
Thank you.

753
01:24:00,970 --> 01:24:04,570
Bernardo, I have to ask you:
Have we ever met before?

754
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:08,310
No... why would you think that?

755
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:12,160
I don't know. It’s strange.

756
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:15,190
Your voice seems
so familiar somehow.

757
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:19,250
Well, I haven't been to Spain
since before you were born.

758
01:24:20,850 --> 01:24:21,850
Of course.

759
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,590
Well, it's a very pleasant voice.

760
01:24:28,820 --> 01:24:29,640
Thank you.

761
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:32,460
Good day, Bernardo.

762
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:33,770
Good day...

763
01:24:40,370 --> 01:24:41,310
Elena.

764
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:00,060
Did you know that
the Compa Indians of Central Peru...

765
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:04,470
used to cannibalize their slain enemies
in order to absorb their power?

766
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:08,820
The eyes, in particular,
were most sought-after.

767
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:14,550
To be able to see
through the eyes of an enemy...

768
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:17,170
is a valuable thing.

769
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:24,650
Where are my manners?
Would you...

770
01:25:26,050 --> 01:25:27,620
Would you care for something to drink?

771
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:34,920
No?

772
01:25:36,390 --> 01:25:38,360
A different vintage, perhaps.

773
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:50,570
You're a very sick person,
Capitan Love.

774
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:56,160
Heads in water jars,
hands in wine pitchers...

775
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,080
must strike you as odd,
I suppose.

776
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:03,920
Well, for one thing, I think
you ought to fire your housekeeper.

777
01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:11,630
Who is he?

778
01:26:12,930 --> 01:26:14,060
An enemy.

779
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:19,240
He has a brother out there
who will share the same fate.

780
01:26:22,770 --> 01:26:24,100
I wish you luck.

781
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:30,410
To your health.

782
01:26:30,410 --> 01:26:32,130
Murrieta's brother or not...

783
01:26:33,550 --> 01:26:35,380
You are more
than you pretend to be.

784
01:26:37,050 --> 01:26:38,420
Maybe someday...

785
01:26:39,020 --> 01:26:41,120
I will see what I look like
through your eyes...

786
01:26:41,810 --> 01:26:42,990
Capitan Love.

787
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,600
Oh, it is beautiful.

788
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:50,420
Excuse me.
How much does it cost?

789
01:27:57,200 --> 01:28:00,700
It is a gift, she says,
in honor of your mother.

790
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:03,370
My mother?

791
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:06,910
She loved your mother.

792
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:11,680
No, tell her she must be mistaken.
My mother died long ago in Spain.

793
01:28:24,490 --> 01:28:26,700
She says there is
no mistaken the daughter...

794
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:28,760
of Esperanza and Diego de la Vega.

795
01:28:29,710 --> 01:28:31,450
She says she was your nanny.

796
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:34,930
She hung flowers on your crib
when you were little.

797
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:40,300
I'm sorry.
I cannot accept it.

798
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:01,160
Alejandro...

799
01:29:03,650 --> 01:29:04,750
Alejandro, listen to me.

800
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:07,960
Can you find your way
back to the mine?

801
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:10,960
No.

802
01:29:13,370 --> 01:29:15,260
The carriage windows
were all covered.

803
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,310
He didn't even trust
his own dons.

804
01:29:19,570 --> 01:29:20,440
Nor would I.

805
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:23,520
You must go
to Montero's house tonight...

806
01:29:23,950 --> 01:29:25,860
break into the chest of his study...

807
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:27,830
find anything that will tell us
what his plans are--

808
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:29,660
People at the mine are dying...

809
01:29:31,190 --> 01:29:34,070
and... all I can think of is...

810
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:36,410
Capitan Love.

811
01:29:36,910 --> 01:29:39,710
He will come into your circle
soon enough. You need not chase him.

812
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:45,870
- I miss my brother, sir.
- Your brother is dead.

813
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:50,070
We lose the ones we love.
we cannot change it. Put it aside.

814
01:29:50,670 --> 01:29:51,640
How?

815
01:29:54,210 --> 01:29:55,860
How can I do what is needed...

816
01:29:56,910 --> 01:29:58,340
when all I feel is...

817
01:29:59,810 --> 01:30:00,680
hate?

818
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:04,020
You hide it...

819
01:30:06,690 --> 01:30:07,690
with this.

820
01:30:19,670 --> 01:30:22,970
Santa Anna has agreed to the transfer
at noon, the day after tomorrow...

821
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:26,380
but he insists we deliver the gold
five miles north of town.

822
01:30:26,570 --> 01:30:27,740
Captain Love?

823
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:34,820
It’s a safe distance from the mine.
The bars are stamped and ready.

824
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:36,790
I don't foresee a problem.

825
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:38,890
Tell him we agree.

826
01:30:39,620 --> 01:30:41,640
You've done well, Luiz.
Very well.

827
01:30:46,030 --> 01:30:48,570
To the independent
Republic of California.

828
01:30:53,330 --> 01:30:54,570
Don Rafael!

829
01:31:20,190 --> 01:31:23,020
Did you send men to the hills?
Doubled the guard at the wall?

830
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:24,560
Yes, yes, of course.

831
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:34,470
- After all, if it's only one man...
- It isn't just one man. Damn it.

832
01:31:34,540 --> 01:31:35,640
It’s Zorro.

833
01:31:37,610 --> 01:31:39,040
And he knows about the mine.

834
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:41,410
Otherwise
he wouldn't be here tonight.

835
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:44,780
- How could he possibly...
- It doesn't matter how.

836
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:48,150
You don't seem
to grasp the situation, Captain.

837
01:31:48,290 --> 01:31:51,460
If Santa Anna finds out we've paid him
in gold stolen from his own land...

838
01:31:51,460 --> 01:31:53,390
he will have us butchered,
like cattle.

839
01:31:53,670 --> 01:31:55,130
Do you understand?

840
01:31:58,330 --> 01:32:00,300
Then we should destroy the evidence.

841
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:03,230
Set explosives, bury the mine.

842
01:32:05,070 --> 01:32:06,240
And the workers?

843
01:32:06,330 --> 01:32:08,540
We destroy all the evidence,
Don Rafael.

844
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:10,270
No witnesses.

845
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:19,350
Make sure those papers
are locked up.

846
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:38,990
Guards!

847
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:50,370
The much-debated Zorro.

848
01:32:50,830 --> 01:32:51,680
No.

849
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:54,180
The Legendary Zorro.

850
01:32:57,190 --> 01:32:58,490
Put down your weapons!

851
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:00,550
Tell them.

852
01:33:01,330 --> 01:33:02,760
Do as he says.

853
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:10,600
Allow me.

854
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:18,530
Come.

855
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:20,540
Stop.

856
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:22,940
Face the window.

857
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:28,170
Now, bend down and touch your toes.

858
01:33:30,850 --> 01:33:32,300
Bend over!

859
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:36,520
Do excuse me,
Capitan Love.

860
01:33:38,730 --> 01:33:39,680
Thank you.

861
01:36:03,450 --> 01:36:04,200
Kill him!

862
01:36:33,630 --> 01:36:34,860
<i>Good morning, Señor. </i>

863
01:36:39,940 --> 01:36:41,170
Good morning, Señorita.

864
01:36:41,540 --> 01:36:43,710
- Give it back.
- What?

865
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:48,410
Whatever it is you have stolen from
my father, I want it back. Give it to me!

866
01:36:49,980 --> 01:36:50,780
No.

867
01:36:58,640 --> 01:36:59,510
Come on now.

868
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:16,720
I don't have the time
to give you the proper instruction.

869
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:22,710
I have had the proper instruction
since I was four.

870
01:38:17,130 --> 01:38:17,960
Not bad.

871
01:38:21,310 --> 01:38:22,430
Not bad at all.

872
01:38:45,790 --> 01:38:47,370
This will make it more difficult.

873
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:50,720
Señorita--

874
01:39:15,630 --> 01:39:16,720
Don't move.

875
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:39,480
Do you surrender?

876
01:39:40,170 --> 01:39:41,130
Never.

877
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:44,110
But I may scream.

878
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:46,980
I understand.

879
01:39:48,220 --> 01:39:50,210
Sometimes I have that effect.

880
01:40:19,570 --> 01:40:20,580
Excuse me.

881
01:40:24,620 --> 01:40:25,790
Good-bye, Señorita.

882
01:40:38,610 --> 01:40:40,170
What are you doing here?
What happened?

883
01:40:40,490 --> 01:40:42,740
Zorro.
Zorro was here.

884
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:45,740
I fought him, and he left.
He left!

885
01:40:46,170 --> 01:40:47,440
Did you recognize him?

886
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:48,660
No...

887
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:51,480
but he was young and vigorous.

888
01:40:52,830 --> 01:40:54,520
He was very vigorous, Father.

889
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:58,390
- Vigorous?
- Yes.

890
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:39,290
Let's go!

891
01:42:56,930 --> 01:42:57,870
Go!

892
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:14,730
Here.
This is the canyon.

893
01:44:15,010 --> 01:44:16,180
That is where the mine is.

894
01:44:18,180 --> 01:44:19,500
They have...

895
01:44:20,140 --> 01:44:22,440
25, 30 guards at most.

896
01:44:22,990 --> 01:44:25,560
- Nothing that Zorro can't overcome.
- I'm not going with you.

897
01:44:26,470 --> 01:44:27,350
What?

898
01:44:28,860 --> 01:44:30,370
I'm not going with you.

899
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:35,460
There's something I must do.
It’s a personal matter.

900
01:44:37,810 --> 01:44:39,040
What about the prisoners?

901
01:44:39,590 --> 01:44:40,970
There's nothing more
I can do for them.

902
01:44:42,940 --> 01:44:44,410
You mean nothing you will do.

903
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:45,930
I gave my life to them.

904
01:44:47,710 --> 01:44:49,410
In return, I lost everything.

905
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:53,400
My wife was murdered before my eyes,
and my child was stolen...

906
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:55,100
to be raised by my mortal enemy.

907
01:44:56,290 --> 01:44:57,300
Montero?

908
01:45:01,340 --> 01:45:02,160
Elena.

909
01:45:04,780 --> 01:45:06,130
She's your daughter.

910
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:09,230
Yes. She was.

911
01:45:14,510 --> 01:45:15,240
So...

912
01:45:17,350 --> 01:45:19,090
You will simply take your revenge.

913
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:20,870
No, I will take my daughter.

914
01:45:21,850 --> 01:45:23,960
And don't pretend
she means nothing to you.

915
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:25,060
Well, she does.

916
01:45:25,650 --> 01:45:28,580
But you taught me to see beyond
personal feelings. Remember?

917
01:45:29,190 --> 01:45:30,410
Was that all a lie?

918
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:35,520
- You're too young to understand.
- To understand what?

919
01:45:36,110 --> 01:45:37,190
Betrayal?

920
01:45:38,220 --> 01:45:41,590
All the work, all the training,
all the wise words, for what?

921
01:45:42,350 --> 01:45:46,570
To smile in the face of my brother's
killer while you make your own plans?

922
01:45:50,270 --> 01:45:53,270
Alejandro, I taught you
everything you need to survive.

923
01:45:54,340 --> 01:45:56,240
Now I must look to my own heart.

924
01:45:58,910 --> 01:46:02,650
Elena is all I have left.
I'm not going to lose her again.

925
01:46:06,020 --> 01:46:07,350
What about California?

926
01:46:07,810 --> 01:46:08,990
What about the people?

927
01:46:10,550 --> 01:46:12,190
They still have Zorro.

928
01:46:41,620 --> 01:46:43,590
I have every inch
of the countryside covered.

929
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:45,160
If he shows himself...

930
01:46:48,090 --> 01:46:48,920
Are you all right?

931
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:51,440
- Do you have the map?
- We'll find it.

932
01:46:51,810 --> 01:46:54,240
Is your army ready
to fight Santa Anna's?

933
01:46:54,510 --> 01:46:55,110
No, sir.

934
01:46:55,110 --> 01:46:57,850
Then why are you asking me if I'm
all right. Of course, I'm not all right.

935
01:46:57,860 --> 01:47:01,580
Now I'm really beginning to wonder if you want
this operation to succeed at all, Captain Love.

936
01:47:01,580 --> 01:47:04,240
- Just what are you saying, Don Rafael?
- What I'm saying, Captain...

937
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:07,220
is that I think my horse
could run this army better than you.

938
01:47:12,770 --> 01:47:14,280
I said I'll find him.

939
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:18,370
That means I will.

940
01:47:21,950 --> 01:47:23,690
Perhaps I can save you
the trouble.

941
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:26,260
Go on.
Reach for it, Captain.

942
01:47:28,740 --> 01:47:29,530
Who are you?

943
01:47:29,790 --> 01:47:32,540
I warned you long ago,
Rafael...

944
01:47:34,330 --> 01:47:35,940
that you would never be rid of me.

945
01:47:36,860 --> 01:47:38,140
De la Vega.

946
01:47:42,310 --> 01:47:43,320
Rafael.

947
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:46,260
You were not the Zorro
I saw last night.

948
01:47:47,130 --> 01:47:49,200
That was your master,
Don Alejandro.

949
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:50,210
Yes.

950
01:47:51,310 --> 01:47:54,350
But there are many who would
proudly wear the mask of Zorro.

951
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:56,810
Either way,
it's of little consequence.

952
01:47:57,090 --> 01:47:59,660
Events have been set in motion
that you cannot stop.

953
01:48:00,340 --> 01:48:01,630
I'm not here to stop you.

954
01:48:04,230 --> 01:48:05,760
Call for Elena.

955
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:11,080
Call her.

956
01:48:14,060 --> 01:48:15,250
Captain...

957
01:48:16,350 --> 01:48:17,780
bring my daughter to me.

958
01:48:19,930 --> 01:48:21,220
Bring her to me!

959
01:48:30,620 --> 01:48:32,500
You cannot imagine, Rafael...

960
01:48:33,230 --> 01:48:35,070
how I have dreamed of this moment.

961
01:48:35,390 --> 01:48:38,370
Night and day, 20 long years.

962
01:48:40,300 --> 01:48:41,170
Really?

963
01:48:42,370 --> 01:48:44,200
I haven't given you
a second thought.

964
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:49,710
If I die, De la Vega,
the truth dies with me.

965
01:48:50,710 --> 01:48:51,680
We shall see.

966
01:48:51,940 --> 01:48:53,110
Father!

967
01:48:54,380 --> 01:48:56,170
Bernardo, what are you doing?

968
01:48:56,680 --> 01:48:57,960
Tell her, Rafael.

969
01:48:59,950 --> 01:49:01,860
Tell me what?
What is going on?

970
01:49:02,350 --> 01:49:04,710
Tell her who her real father is.

971
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:07,160
Father, what is he saying?

972
01:49:10,620 --> 01:49:11,680
This...

973
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:15,210
unfortunate man
lost a daughter once.

974
01:49:15,300 --> 01:49:18,790
It has driven him mad, and now
he seeks to claim you for his own.

975
01:49:21,130 --> 01:49:22,230
Tell her...

976
01:49:22,870 --> 01:49:24,290
how her mother died.

977
01:49:28,140 --> 01:49:30,720
Your daughter is lost,
De la Vega.

978
01:49:32,210 --> 01:49:33,790
You cannot have mine.

979
01:49:34,120 --> 01:49:35,320
De la Vega?

980
01:49:37,690 --> 01:49:39,760
A woman in town, she told me.

981
01:49:42,140 --> 01:49:44,070
Diego de la Vega?

982
01:49:47,370 --> 01:49:48,330
Father?

983
01:49:50,230 --> 01:49:52,190
His name is of no consequence...

984
01:49:56,510 --> 01:49:59,710
I was told my ninera
used to hang something on my crib.

985
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:02,410
Yes.

986
01:50:03,610 --> 01:50:05,350
She had her hang fresh flowers...

987
01:50:05,350 --> 01:50:06,150
No!

988
01:50:08,330 --> 01:50:09,080
No!

989
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:16,550
Let us finish it, Rafael.

990
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:21,330
Let us finish what we started
the night Esperanza died.

991
01:50:23,060 --> 01:50:24,400
Drop your sword...

992
01:50:24,710 --> 01:50:27,140
or I will have no choice
but to have you shot...

993
01:50:27,970 --> 01:50:29,710
even in the presence
of my daughter.

994
01:50:33,470 --> 01:50:34,370
Please.

995
01:50:50,490 --> 01:50:51,730
They were flowers.

996
01:50:52,420 --> 01:50:53,610
Romania.
(<i>Romneya</i>)

997
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:01,440
Rafael...

998
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:05,720
She knows.

999
01:53:15,160 --> 01:53:16,070
Water!

1000
01:53:52,070 --> 01:53:53,230
Lock them up!

1001
01:54:49,290 --> 01:54:51,020
The fuses are burning.
Hurry it up.

1002
01:54:56,360 --> 01:54:57,300
Let's go!

1003
01:55:20,470 --> 01:55:21,720
Wait here!

1004
01:55:31,630 --> 01:55:33,430
Secure the wagon.
Stay alert.

1005
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:04,820
De la Vega.

1006
01:57:06,260 --> 01:57:07,170
Rafael.

1007
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:22,590
Only one question.

1008
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:29,010
Really? What is that?

1009
01:58:33,940 --> 01:58:36,070
How would you like
your remains displayed?

1010
02:00:06,640 --> 02:00:07,760
Now I am free...

1011
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:10,310
- to kill you.
- No!

1012
02:00:17,270 --> 02:00:18,540
Drop the sword.

1013
02:00:19,480 --> 02:00:20,410
Drop it.

1014
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:32,420
You really think
I would have killed my own child?

1015
02:00:58,460 --> 02:00:59,500
Did you miss me?

1016
02:01:23,500 --> 02:01:25,070
Elena! Get them out!

1017
02:01:33,250 --> 02:01:34,170
"M"...

1018
02:01:35,010 --> 02:01:36,150
for Murrieta.

1019
02:01:36,870 --> 02:01:37,840
Two men.

1020
02:01:38,940 --> 02:01:40,040
One dead!

1021
02:02:41,910 --> 02:02:43,210
You're doing well.

1022
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:45,910
Your brother would have
shot himself by now.

1023
02:04:41,790 --> 02:04:42,710
Alejandro.

1024
02:05:59,420 --> 02:06:00,540
Is it finished?

1025
02:06:02,310 --> 02:06:03,370
Yes, Don Diego.

1026
02:06:04,780 --> 02:06:05,790
It’s finished.

1027
02:06:08,270 --> 02:06:09,510
Not for Zorro.

1028
02:06:10,840 --> 02:06:13,820
There will be other days,
other battles to fight.

1029
02:06:14,780 --> 02:06:16,570
It is your curse and destiny.

1030
02:06:20,660 --> 02:06:22,230
My beautiful Elena.

1031
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:27,490
The world is a strange place.

1032
02:06:30,240 --> 02:06:33,000
To have found you at last,
only to lose you again.

1033
02:06:33,450 --> 02:06:34,870
You will never lose me...

1034
02:06:36,850 --> 02:06:37,720
Father.

1035
02:06:42,260 --> 02:06:43,130
Elena...

1036
02:06:46,620 --> 02:06:47,770
You are like your mother.

1037
02:06:50,150 --> 02:06:51,160
Same eyes.

1038
02:06:52,540 --> 02:06:53,590
Same mouth.

1039
02:06:55,200 --> 02:06:56,390
Same spirit.

1040
02:07:02,080 --> 02:07:03,180
Alejandro.

1041
02:07:06,470 --> 02:07:07,500
My child.

1042
02:07:28,600 --> 02:07:29,890
<i>And so it was. </i>

1043
02:07:31,060 --> 02:07:32,910
<i>Lightning split the sky. </i>

1044
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:35,230
<i>Thunder shook the earth. </i>

1045
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,100
<i>Then all was quiet. </i>

1046
02:07:40,750 --> 02:07:43,670
The great warrior known as Zorro...

1047
02:07:44,610 --> 02:07:45,660
was gone.

1048
02:07:47,630 --> 02:07:50,020
The people of the land
gave him a hero's funeral.

1049
02:07:50,020 --> 02:07:52,310
The largest anyone had ever seen.

1050
02:07:53,320 --> 02:07:55,520
They came from far and wide...

1051
02:07:55,580 --> 02:07:58,520
to say farewell
to the brave and noble champion.

1052
02:08:02,450 --> 02:08:04,030
But don't worry, little Joaquin.

1053
02:08:05,560 --> 02:08:07,860
Whenever great deeds are remembered...

1054
02:08:08,650 --> 02:08:10,340
your grandfather will live on.

1055
02:08:12,540 --> 02:08:15,430
For there must always,
always be a Zorro.

1056
02:08:16,310 --> 02:08:18,510
And someday, when he's needed...

1057
02:08:19,330 --> 02:08:20,570
We will see him again...

1058
02:08:21,860 --> 02:08:24,350
On his fearsome steed Tornado...

1059
02:08:24,610 --> 02:08:26,210
riding like the wind...

1060
02:08:26,950 --> 02:08:29,110
his sword blazing in the sun.

1061
02:08:30,110 --> 02:08:33,420
Leaping, jumping,
swinging through the air.

1062
02:08:33,650 --> 02:08:36,060
Fighting like a lion.
Fighting like a tiger.

1063
02:08:36,090 --> 02:08:37,230
Fighting...

1064
02:08:44,930 --> 02:08:46,350
As safely as possible.

1065
02:08:48,740 --> 02:08:51,260
Is this your idea
of putting the baby to sleep?

1066
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:00,390
Sleep tight, my son.

1067
02:09:07,720 --> 02:09:12,500
When I sleep, I will dream
of this dashing rogue Zorro.

1068
02:09:14,060 --> 02:09:15,670
But what face shall I give him?

1069
02:09:17,870 --> 02:09:19,530
He has been many different men, but...

1070
02:09:19,530 --> 02:09:19,980
he has loved you as all of them.
He has been many different men, but...

1071
02:09:19,980 --> 02:09:22,970
he has loved you as all of them.

1072
02:09:28,930 --> 02:09:30,760
How can I refuse such a man?

1073
02:09:32,940 --> 02:09:34,750
Do you know where I might find him?

1074
02:09:36,270 --> 02:09:37,520
You know Zorro.

1075
02:09:38,790 --> 02:09:40,450
He could be anywhere.

1076
02:09:57,460 --> 02:09:59,350
There, there, my darling.
