1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,629
<i>I still think
about the night</i>

2
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:07,464
<i>your mother and I
had to leave you.</i>

3
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,304
Hopefully,
it's not for long,

4
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,306
but I'll call you
when we get settled.

5
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:18,308
When I have a better
indication of what's going on.

6
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:19,351
Mommy?

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,064
Jellybean.

8
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,652
Daddy and I have
a last-minute business trip...

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,071
so Rose is gonna stay with you
for a few days.

10
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,365
No. I don't want you to go.

11
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:36,577
It's gonna be so boring.

12
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,245
I won't be able to keep my...

13
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:39,830
eyes...

14
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:46,086
Goodbye, sweetheart.
All right, we'll see you soon.

15
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:47,838
Okay.

16
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,381
Janet, we gotta go.

17
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,762
<i>I wish we could have
put down our bags...</i>

18
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:57,014
<i>tucked you back
into your bed...</i>

19
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,434
<i>but too many lives
were at stake.</i>

20
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,647
Oh, my God.

21
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,441
They've already launched.

22
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,734
We have to stop it.

23
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:09,902
Come on.

24
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:21,872
<i>To disarm the missile,
we had to get inside it...</i>

25
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,833
<i>but the plating was too thick.</i>

26
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,920
<i>The only way in was to shrink
between the molecules.</i>

27
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,841
I can't get through.

28
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,177
Hank.

29
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,348
<i>We both knew
that if you go that small...</i>

30
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,599
<i>there is no coming back.</i>

31
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:45,687
<i>It should have been me,
but my regulator was damaged.</i>

32
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,857
<i>Your mother's wasn't.</i>

33
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,985
Tell Hope I love her.

34
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,445
She turned it off.

35
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:54,947
Janet. No!

36
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,533
<i>She went subatomic
to deactivate the bomb.</i>

37
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,416
<i>Your mother saved
thousands of lives that day</i>

38
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:10,045
<i>knowing she'd be lost
in the quantum realm.</i>

39
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,297
<i>Alone.</i>

40
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,674
<i>Afraid.</i>

41
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,426
<i>Gone forever.</i>

42
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,153
<i>Telling you that she wasn't
coming home...</i>

43
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:37,614
<i>was the hardest thing
that I ever had to do.</i>

44
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,245
But then Scott showed up.

45
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,874
Or should I say,
broke into our house.

46
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,918
<i>And when he went
to the quantum realm...</i>

47
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,590
<i>and came back.</i>

48
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,009
<i>Everything changed.</i>

49
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,888
I started to wonder...

50
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,640
could your mother
still be alive?

51
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,270
So, I dusted off
some old plans.

52
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,990
Dad, what are you saying?

53
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:24,661
I think it's possible
to bring her back.

54
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,661
Okay. We're in.

55
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,958
Oh, this place is a maze.

56
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,001
Where's that map?

57
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,589
We're definitely close.

58
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,549
- You ready?
- I'm ready, Daddy.

59
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,426
Are you sure?
'Cause once we're inside,

60
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,720
you show any hesitation
or fear, we're done.

61
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,847
I eat fear for breakfast.

62
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,475
Wow. That is super cool.

63
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,726
Come on.

64
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:37,150
Look! It's Anton.
He'll show us the way.

65
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:43,865
Anton, which way do we go?

66
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,000
Thanks, Anton!

67
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:57,629
Look, the ants have burrowed
into the tech facility.

68
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,506
Oh no, lasers!

69
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,677
Oh! I think I got lased!

70
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,140
The secret vault.

71
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,101
Tell me you brought
the contact lens.

72
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,936
Yup.

73
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,982
Perfect! Right there.

74
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,363
There!
It's the micro-treasure!

75
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,157
My trophy?

76
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,825
It looks like treasure.

77
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,285
Oh, it is to me.

78
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,828
I want to take it
to show-and-tell.

79
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,038
Oh, no, you can't do that.

80
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,333
You can't. It never leaves
the house. It's too important.

81
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,543
This is the best birthday
present you ever got me.

82
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,711
I'm so touched you think

83
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,629
I'm the world's
greatest grandma.

84
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,131
It was the only one they had.

85
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,008
It makes me want
to knit you a sweater.

86
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,470
Oh, no, the fuzz!

87
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:47,471
Hey, Scotty...

88
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:48,680
I was looking
at the schematics

89
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,182
for the
Karapetyan buildings...

90
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,433
and I think we have

91
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,809
way too many security cameras,
don't we?

92
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,186
No, no, not at all.

93
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,771
I mean, 'cause it's a lot of
security cameras.

94
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,064
I know what he needs.

95
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,940
Who's the security expert
in our business?

96
00:05:59,108 --> 00:05:59,900
You are, but I'm running
the company, right?

97
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:00,942
And if we overquote him...

98
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,110
he's gonna go somewhere else.

99
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:02,903
I mean,
we gotta land this bird.

100
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,279
He ain't goin' anywhere.

101
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,530
And the expression is
"land this fish. "

102
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,115
No, it's "land the bird. "

103
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,367
Just like you land the plane.

104
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,534
You gotta land the plane
to be in business.

105
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:10,994
I know it's silly
to get hung up

106
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,579
on these kinds of things,
but I do.

107
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,914
How am I gonna land a fish?

108
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,957
It can't walk.
And if it swam up on shore...

109
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,293
and it battled a hawk,
who's gonna win?

110
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,463
You've really turned me around
on this thing.

111
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,548
It's okay.
We're gonna land Karapetyan.

112
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,966
Now, if you just excuse me...

113
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:25,717
I'm in the middle of trying to

114
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,468
steal something
with my daughter.

115
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:27,677
I'm gonna go recheck it.

116
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,389
To the escape ant!

117
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,309
Let's bounce
before the po-po come back!

118
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,396
The po-po?
How do you even know that?

119
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,564
Let's fly, Antoinette!
Let's fly!

120
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,785
Crash landing!

121
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,249
I wish we could shrink
for real.

122
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,917
Oh. That is pretty cool.

123
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,627
Hey, I'm headed
to the office, Scotty.

124
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,462
And sorry about freaking out
earlier, you know.

125
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,713
But I feel
like I'm way better.

126
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:06,007
My heart is definitely beating
way too hard and stuff.

127
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,217
And my hands are shaking.

128
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,343
But I think it's unrelated,
you know?

129
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:09,845
It's gonna be great, Luis!

130
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,054
You got nothing
to worry about!

131
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,723
Yeah, yeah. I'm the boss.
I'm the boss.

132
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,058
I'm the boss.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

133
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,643
Daddy!

134
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,818
Come on, Woo!
I've got three days left.

135
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,111
Why would I try to escape?

136
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,988
Sorry, Scott,
but rules are rules.

137
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,656
You trip the perimeter alarm,
we search the place.

138
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,491
Keel to stern, soup to nuts.

139
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,243
Thank you.

140
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,495
It was an accident. My foot
went through the fence.

141
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:36,955
Our flying ant crashed.

142
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,332
Hey, you try and entertain
a 10-year-old

143
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,417
when you can't leave
the house.

144
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,878
You know the lengths
that I've gone to?

145
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,714
Close-up magic.

146
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,801
I learned that.

147
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,345
Why can't you just leave
my daddy alone?

148
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,515
Oh, Cassie.

149
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,893
This must all seem like
a bunch of confusing

150
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,478
grown-up stuff to you?

151
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,313
Well, think of it this way.

152
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,190
Your school has rules, right?

153
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,192
Like, you can't draw
on the walls.

154
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,277
Well, your daddy
went to Germany

155
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,321
and drew on the walls
with Captain America.

156
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,823
And that was a violation
ofArticle 16,

157
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,034
Paragraph Three
of the Sokovia Accords.

158
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,952
Now, as a part of
his joint plea deal...

159
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,371
with Homeland Security
and the German government...

160
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,248
he was allowed to return
to the U.S...

161
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,709
provided he serve two years
under house arrest...

162
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,586
followed by three years
of probation.

163
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,547
And avoid any unauthorized
activities, technology...

164
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,841
or contact with any
former associates who were...

165
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,220
or currently are
in violation of said Accords.

166
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,804
Or any related statutes.

167
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,223
Okay, sweetie?

168
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,726
Wow. You're really great
with kids.

169
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,770
Thanks.
I'm also a youth pastor.

170
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,523
Anyway, not to be
a Johnny ask-a-lot...

171
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,982
but you haven't had
any contact

172
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,734
with Hank Pym
or Hope Van Dyne, have you?

173
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,361
- No.
- You sure?

174
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,404
Because it's only a matter
of time before we get 'em.

175
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,074
It was their tech, so they
violated the Accords, too.

176
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:57,077
And associating with them
breaks your deal.

177
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,371
And, I don't need
to remind you...

178
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,248
that any violation
of your agreement

179
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,041
means 20 years in prison.
Minimum.

180
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,669
I haven't talked to Hank
or Hope in forever.

181
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:06,962
They hate his guts.

182
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:07,837
Thanks, peanut.

183
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,966
How'd you do it, Scott?

184
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:12,717
Do what?

185
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,845
The card trick.

186
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,472
Seriously?

187
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,641
Oh, my God!

188
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,102
You people
can't just show up here

189
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,770
whenever you want
and search the place.

190
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:24,938
Actually, they can.

191
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:25,897
You need a warrant.

192
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,107
Actually, they don't.

193
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,775
Really? Wow.

194
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,027
Did you pack
your soccer shoes?

195
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,321
- Yeah.
All right.

196
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,199
Next time I see you will be
on the outside.

197
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,951
All right.

198
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,036
Oh, get on the inside of this.

199
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,831
Hey, three days.
Seriously...

200
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,124
- I'm proud of you, bud.
- Thank you.

201
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,625
You know what?
Give me another one.

202
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,877
Me too!
Gosh! Freedom!

203
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,630
New business!
I am sensing greatness.

204
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,382
I had a fun weekend, Daddy.

205
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,467
Me too, peanut. But just wait
till next weekend.

206
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:55,635
Once I'm outta here,

207
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,928
you and I are
gonna go paint this town red.

208
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,348
We'll have so much ice cream,
we'll never stop puking.

209
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,232
You're gettin' good at that.

210
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,442
How'd you do that?

211
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,484
Bye, Daddy.
Bye.

212
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,030
- Bye.
Bye.

213
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,160
Three days.

214
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,078
Easy-peasy.

215
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,173
<i>Snap your fingers. That gets
them to look over there.</i>

216
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,175
<i>And that is misdirection.</i>

217
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,263
<i>We had a dream</i>

218
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,973
<i>We'd go travelin' together</i>

219
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,185
<i>We'd spread a little lovin'
then we'd keep movin' on</i>

220
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,300
Easy-peasy.

221
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,850
<i>Where are you?</i>

222
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,528
<i>Everything
that you know...</i>

223
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,533
<i>Lost...</i>

224
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,077
<i>in the quantum realm.</i>

225
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,794
What?

226
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,255
I'm gonna find you,
Jellybean.

227
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,387
I found you!

228
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,014
You always find me, Mommy.

229
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,392
<i>What the hell?</i>

230
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,451
Hey, Hank!
It's been a while.

231
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:29,080
I don't even know if
this is your number anymore.

232
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,582
And I'm probably
the last person

233
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,250
you wanna hear from.

234
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,545
But I just had
a really weird dream.

235
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,838
And I know that doesn't

236
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,089
sound like an emergency
or anything...

237
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:42,385
but it just felt very real.

238
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,055
I was back
in the quantum realm...

239
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:49,225
and I think I saw your wife.

240
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,352
And then I was your wife.

241
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,355
I mean, not in a weird way
or anything.

242
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,860
You know,
hearing this out loud,

243
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,321
I'm thinking,
it's not an emergency.

244
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,490
I'm sorry to bother you.

245
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,118
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

246
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,380
<i>That means, one tiny atom
in my fingernail could be...</i>

247
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:24,803
<i>Could be one,
little, tiny universe.</i>

248
00:13:58,712 --> 00:13:59,546
Hope?

249
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,341
Is this another dream?

250
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,551
Do you think it was a dream...

251
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,303
or is it possible that you
really saw my mom down there?

252
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,472
I'm not sure.

253
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,269
I can't be here!

254
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,062
I can't be here!
I'm under house arrest!

255
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,065
They won't open while
the system's engaged, Scott.

256
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,671
You have to take me home.
They could show up any second!

257
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,964
Relax. As far as your
nanny cops know,

258
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,173
you're still at home.

259
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,147
Scotty?

260
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,149
<i>He's programmed to
replicate your daily routine.</i>

261
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,692
Nine hours in bed.

262
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,985
Five hours in front of the TV.

263
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,279
Two hours in the bathroom,
whatever that's about.

264
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,864
That's totally inaccurate.

265
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,657
And how do you know
about my daily routine?

266
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,783
Are you spying on me?

267
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,619
We keep tabs on all
security threats, all right?

268
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,829
And so far the biggest one
we've had is you.

269
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,293
I'm sorry about Germany.
They just showed up.

270
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,337
They said it was
a matter of national security.

271
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,671
That Cap needed help, so...

272
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,089
Cap?

273
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,968
Tain America.
Captain. Cap.

274
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,929
It's what we call him.

275
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,555
If you're a friend.

276
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,848
I'm not saying I'm a friend
of... A little, I know him.

277
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,058
He's nice. Whatever.

278
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,186
I'm sorry! All right?
I didn't think I'd get caught.

279
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,854
You didn't think
about a lot of things.

280
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,482
How's Hank?

281
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,651
We're still running. The house
is gone, so is our freedom.

282
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,027
How do you think he is?

283
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,029
I'm sorry. I know you're mad.

284
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,656
I'm not looking
for an apology, Scott.

285
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,449
The only reason
why we're even talking is...

286
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,201
because we need
what's in your head.

287
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,950
Is this where you're living?

288
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:38,371
If you need help or money
or something, maybe I can...

289
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,872
We're fine.

290
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,182
Hey, Hank.
Look, I just wanna...

291
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,184
Save it!

292
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,730
- Can we start?
Yeah.

293
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,233
So, while you were relaxing
at home...

294
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,778
we were building this.

295
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,739
It's a tunnel.
To the quantum realm.

296
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,033
To my mom.

297
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,326
We think she might still
be down there.

298
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,410
We just don't know where.

299
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,369
What?

300
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,081
If we can pinpoint
my mom's location...

301
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,166
then the pod can take me down
to get her.

302
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,584
You built all this
and you don't even know

303
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:07,877
if she's alive?

304
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,962
It's called a hypothesis.

305
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,840
Last night, we powered up
the tunnel for the first time.

306
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,134
It was overloaded
and it shut down.

307
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,886
But for a split second,

308
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,931
the doorway to the
quantum realm was opened.

309
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:21,891
And?

310
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,144
And five minutes later,
you called, talking about Mom.

311
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,063
We think
when you were down there,

312
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,523
you may have entangled
with her.

313
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,733
Hank, I would never do that.
I respect you too much.

314
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,069
Quantum entanglement, Scott.

315
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,487
We think she might have put

316
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,780
some kind of a message
in your head.

317
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,740
Hopefully, a location.

318
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,534
And opening the tunnel
triggered it.

319
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,285
Your mom put a message
in my head?

320
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,995
Come on. That's insane.

321
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,205
No, Scott.

322
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,707
Insane is going to Germany

323
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,168
without telling us,
and fighting the Avengers.

324
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,421
Just tell me you weren't lying
about the suit you took.

325
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,383
Tell me
you really destroyed it.

326
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,760
I did, I destroyed it,
I swear.

327
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,804
I can't believe
you destroyed my suit!

328
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,306
That was my life's work!

329
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,724
What was I supposed to do?

330
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,644
You were supposed to not
take my suit!

331
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,812
I'm sorry, Hank!

332
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,355
I'm sorry I took the suit.

333
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,649
I'm sorry
that I called last night.

334
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,651
I don't remember
seeing Janet down there.

335
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,027
I wish that I did.

336
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,112
I just had a dream about her

337
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,780
playing hide-and-seek
with a little girl.

338
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,076
What?

339
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,289
I had a dream.

340
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,083
She was playing hide-and-seek
with a little girl.

341
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,043
Cassie and I do it
all the time.

342
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,378
Doesn't mean anything.

343
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,505
But was it Cassie
in the dream?

344
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,756
No.

345
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,049
Where was she hiding?

346
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,551
- What?
- The little girl.

347
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,761
Where was she hiding?
Was it in a wardrobe?

348
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,056
No, it was in a tall dresser.

349
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,349
You mean a wardrobe.

350
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,642
Is that what that's called?

351
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,477
What color was it?

352
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,104
Red.

353
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,816
Were there horses on it?

354
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,484
Oh, boy.

355
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,530
It's where I hid
every time that we played.

356
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,199
It doesn't sound like

357
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,326
you really got the gist
of the game.

358
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,537
She's alive.

359
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,916
I knew it.

360
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,210
I knew it!

361
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,129
We need to get that part.

362
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,464
Okay.

363
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,759
The sooner we get
the tunnel working...

364
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,385
the sooner we can get
this message out of his head.

365
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,553
Does Burch have it?

366
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,055
Yeah. Let's go.
What part?

367
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,349
Who's Burch?
Wait. What's happening?

368
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,310
We need a component
to stop the tunnel

369
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,937
from overloading again.

370
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,689
I grabbed your clothes.
You might want to change.

371
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,117
Look, I'd really like
to help you...

372
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,286
but if I'm not at home
when they come

373
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,412
to take off
my ankle monitor...

374
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,039
then I'm going away forever.

375
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,166
Once we get the component
and power up the tunnel...

376
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,168
we'll get the message,
and have you home by lunch.

377
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,504
We have to hurry.
The entanglement won't last.

378
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:57,672
You owe us.

379
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,174
All right, fine.
But can I just wait inside?

380
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,676
Because I'm not supposed
to be out here.

381
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,312
Let's go.

382
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,331
- We good?
- Yeah.

383
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,041
I'll be right back.

384
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,676
- Can I have one of these?
- No.

385
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:01,110
Ah. Susan! Welcome to Oui!

386
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,903
Sonny!

387
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,905
Oui is French
for "yes. "

388
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,241
As in "yes" to farm-to-table,
"yes" to locally sourced...

389
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,994
and "yes" to planet
before profit.

390
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,747
Well, let's hope
it also means "yes"

391
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,457
to "Do you have the component
I ordered?"

392
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,128
You know, I have always loved
your sense of humor, Susan.

393
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,338
Have a seat.

394
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,380
No, I'm good. Thank you.

395
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:22,840
Who is this guy?

396
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,052
Sonny Burch. He traffics
in black market technology.

397
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,763
He's been getting us what
we need to build the tunnel.

398
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,391
Could I just have one...

399
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,559
No.

400
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:37,646
You know, I have
a special friend at the FBI.

401
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:38,898
And I say "special"...

402
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,859
because, well,
he tells me things

403
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,611
that I didn't previously know.

404
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,863
For example...

405
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,823
your name isn't Susan.

406
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:50,242
It's Hope Van Dyne.

407
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,662
And your unseen associate,
that's your father, Hank Pym.

408
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,956
- That's not good, Hank.
- No shit.

409
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,549
What do you want?

410
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,885
Relationships
are built on trust, Hope.

411
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,471
And I want our relationship
to have a strong foundation.

412
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,722
Our relationship?

413
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,642
My business landscape
has been shifting, Hope.

414
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,602
Hell, S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA
don't even exist anymore...

415
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,687
but now, Hank Pym...

416
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:21,190
Hank Pym
is a real opportunity.

417
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,441
Do you have a point?

418
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,776
Oh, you think
that I don't know

419
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,237
what you've been building
with all this?

420
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,406
Quantum technology.

421
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,450
Now, you can forget nanotech,
forget Al,

422
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,701
forget cryptocurrency.

423
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,453
Quantum energy is the future.

424
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,330
It's the next gold rush.

425
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,456
Is that so?

426
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,041
I want in, Hope.

427
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,669
So, as a gesture of good will,
I have taken the liberty...

428
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,921
of arranging some buyers
for your lab.

429
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,673
Starting bid...

430
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:49,427
one billion dollars.

431
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,178
Thank you, Sonny, really.

432
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,555
But my father and I
have something

433
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:55,057
slightly more pressing
than starting a business.

434
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,352
So I'll just take
the component as arranged.

435
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,729
My buyers don't take no
for an answer.

436
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,649
So, we are
either in business together...

437
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,610
or we aren't
in business together.

438
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,449
Then I guess we aren't.

439
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,451
You can go.

440
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,370
But I'm afraid your money's
gonna have to remain.

441
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:19,457
Let's call it compensation
for my injured feelings.

442
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,584
Listen, Sonny.

443
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:24,503
This is gonna be
so much easier on everybody

444
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,130
if you just give me
that component.

445
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,174
Darlin', the only thing
you're takin' from here...

446
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,969
is my heart,
but it will mend in time.

447
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,763
Okay.

448
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,690
So, now what?

449
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:45,941
You'll see.

450
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,611
She said her and her daddy
had something pressing.

451
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:49,862
I want to know what it is

452
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,030
because if they're not working
with us...

453
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,656
they're working with somebody.
So find out.

454
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,949
I want some names...

455
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,414
Hold on, you gave her wings?

456
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:07,630
Get her.

457
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,564
Not my turn-of-the-century
chandelier!

458
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,737
Stop firing! Stop!

459
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,826
All right, take this.
Go. Go, go, go!

460
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,453
Go!

461
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,601
Wings and blasters.

462
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,644
So I take it you didn't have
that tech available for me.

463
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:46,645
No, I did.

464
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,066
It was a pleasure doing
business with you, Sonny.

465
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,736
Oh, our business
isn't finished yet, Hope.

466
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,571
I can assure you of that!

467
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,872
What in the hell is that?

468
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,179
Dad,
are you seeing this?

469
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,263
Hope, get out of there!

470
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,565
- I gotta do something.
- Wait!

471
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:40,199
It is still
a work in progress.

472
00:27:58,843 --> 00:27:59,968
You taught me
that kick. Remember?

473
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,303
Yeah, great form.

474
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,263
Those were the days.
Whatever happened to us?

475
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,556
Not the time, Scott.

476
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,058
Damn it, where'd it go?

477
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,062
I've lost it.

478
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,939
<i>I'm not seeing anything
on the ant cams.</i>

479
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,816
<i>Try looking...</i>

480
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,025
Dad?

481
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,285
Give me that.

482
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,328
Now.

483
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,084
- Are you okay?
- No!

484
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,293
He got the lab.

485
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,211
No.

486
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,421
Come on!

487
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:38,966
What was that?

488
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,426
I don't know.

489
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,428
But we need to find somewhere
to regroup

490
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,346
and figure out
where the lab is.

491
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,306
So, where to now?

492
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,308
How about my house?

493
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:49,560
I'm supposed
to be there anyway,

494
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:50,686
and Woo could walk in
any second.

495
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,063
Exactly why we're not going
to your house.

496
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,440
What about your house?

497
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,317
Sorry.

498
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:00,195
Well, there is one place
I can think of.

499
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,114
No.

500
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,992
No, no, no, no!

501
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,578
No!

502
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,332
Wow, Dr. Pym...

503
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,834
who would've thought that,

504
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,210
once again,
in your hour of need...

505
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:17,379
that you would turn to us,
you know?

506
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,505
Not me.

507
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,883
Help yourself.

508
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,176
Hey, what's up
with the fancy pastry?

509
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,677
We gotta keep
the food budget down.

510
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,554
Well, what are we supposed
to have for breakfast?

511
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:26,805
The oatmeal packets.

512
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,515
Oatmeal packets.

513
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,267
- It's insult.
- Why is it an insult?

514
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,518
Because it tastes like sand.

515
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,936
You know why?
'Cause it's organic.

516
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,313
It's not organic, it's sand.

517
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:35,606
It's the most important meal
of the day.

518
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,565
You know what,
you can get creative with it.

519
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:37,691
Break teeth.

520
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:38,984
Put a little brown sugar on
it. You can put some cinnamon.

521
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,152
Put a little honey.
Whatever you want...

522
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:43,238
Guys, guys, guys.
Come on, man.

523
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,032
We got bigger fish to fry.

524
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,658
Is that my desk?

525
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,410
Yeah.
- What?

526
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,995
Why do I have
such a small desk?

527
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,622
Because you weren't there
when we were choosing desks.

528
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,790
You snooze, you lose.

529
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:53,791
Well, I was
under house arrest.

530
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:54,625
Yeah.

531
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:55,876
You know what,
this isn't even a desk.

532
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:56,877
This is garbage.

533
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,671
You found this outside
amongst garbage.

534
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,006
I got it at a rummage sale.

535
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,633
So, you save money
on my desk?

536
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,675
Guys.

537
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,928
Hope, please,
we need to focus, all right?

538
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,263
We gotta find
that lab already. Jeez.

539
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:10,808
Oh, you know what?
I heard stories,

540
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:11,809
like what happened to you.

541
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,019
This crazy, creepy cat, who
walks through walls and stuff.

542
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,896
Like a ghost.

543
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,564
Like Baba Yaga.

544
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,195
Baba Yaga, the witch.

545
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:26,073
They tell stories to children
to frighten them.

546
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,659
You know Baba Yaga?

547
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,078
Whoever stole it...

548
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,663
we need to find it.

549
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:36,291
Oh, you don't find someone
like that. They find you.

550
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,210
Like Baba Yaga.

551
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,088
Dr. Pym, you're the smartest
genius I know.

552
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,590
Didn't you put some kind of
LoJack on your lab?

553
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,883
Because if you didn't,

554
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,927
we have a variety
of affordable options.

555
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:50,472
Of course I did, Luis.
It was disabled.

556
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:53,100
Whoever stole the lab knew
exactly what they were doing.

557
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,227
They also looked like
they were phasing.

558
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:56,436
Phasing?

559
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,146
Quantum phasing.
When an object moves

560
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,481
through different states
of matter.

561
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,483
Oh, yeah,
that's what I was thinking.

562
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:02,693
The lab emits radiation.

563
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,445
Can we modify a quantum
spectrometer and track it?

564
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:08,198
That could work, yes, but all
my equipment is in the lab.

565
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,325
Where else can we find
that equipment?

566
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,079
Well, there is one person.

567
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,456
Bill Foster.

568
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:17,624
Great!

569
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,209
Who's Bill Foster?

570
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,461
He's an old colleague of
my dad's, from S.H.I.E.L.D.

571
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,338
They had a falling out
years ago.

572
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,215
You seem to have a lot of
falling outs with people.

573
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,384
It's probably
just a waste of time.

574
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,511
Hey, I'm risking everything
by being here.

575
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:30,888
Don't you think
we should check?

576
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,348
We need to find out
who took the lab.

577
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,361
Guys,
it's not a good idea

578
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,862
to be out in the open
like this.

579
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,865
Relax,
no one's gonna recognize us.

580
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,409
What, because of hats
and sunglasses?

581
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,036
That's not a disguise, Hank.

582
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,330
We look like ourselves
at a baseball game.

583
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,374
<i>In an isolated system...</i>

584
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:45,087
particles co-exist in
a stable phase relationship.

585
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,422
If the system
is interfered with,

586
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:50,717
that stability becomes chaos.

587
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,678
Unpredictable.

588
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:55,222
Dangerous.
Beautiful.

589
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,766
Isolated completely,
a quantum system

590
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,185
would revert back to
separate states of matter...

591
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:03,981
each entangled with a distinct
state of its environment.

592
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,692
In other words,
the object in question

593
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,443
would be both
in and out of phase...

594
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:11,822
with multiple
parallel realities.

595
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:20,372
Speaking of being out of phase
with reality.

596
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,291
I am noticing
an unusually high number

597
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,669
of glazed eyes out there
among you.

598
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:29,715
So, why don't we call it
a few minutes early?

599
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,049
That'll be enough for today.

600
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,884
Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen, you may go.

601
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:37,639
It's incredible.
You're linked to Janet.

602
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,767
It's quantum entanglement
between the quantum states of

603
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,644
Posner molecules
in your brains.

604
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,229
Yeah, that's what
I was thinking.

605
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,398
Do you guys
just put the word "quantum"

606
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,357
in front of everything?

607
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,234
Doctor, we need to
find our lab.

608
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,777
Hope, I'd love to help you...

609
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:51,570
but I don't have anything

610
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:52,404
like the equipment
you're describing.

611
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,656
I told you this is a waste
of time. Come on, let's go.

612
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:55,907
Don't condescend, Hank.

613
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,118
You're the one who's
on the run from the FBI.

614
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,120
All because
you had to grow to a size

615
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,913
that finally fit your ego.

616
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:05,417
That wasn't me in Germany.
It was this idiot.

617
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,460
Really?

618
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:10,172
Going that big,
it must've been exhausting.

619
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:12,591
I slept for three days
straight. You have no idea.

620
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,842
Actually, I do.

621
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,719
Back in the day,
I was Hank's partner

622
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,554
on a project called Goliath.

623
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,097
Excuse me?
You were my partner?

624
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,183
The only thing more tiring
than going that big

625
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,185
is putting up
with Hank's bullshit.

626
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:24,686
Right...

627
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,940
I don't know.
How big did you get?

628
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,860
My record? 21 feet.

629
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,445
- Not bad.
- You?

630
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,446
I don't...

631
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,572
No, really, I'm curious.

632
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,241
65 feet. Yeah.

633
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,077
- Huge.
-65.

634
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,621
If you two are finished
comparing sizes...

635
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,956
we need to figure out a way
to track down the lab.

636
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:48,126
And the great Hank Pym hasn't
figured that one out yet?

637
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,961
Strange.

638
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,880
You had all the answers
back in the day.

639
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,381
That's why I left the project.

640
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,509
Left? I fired you.

641
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:56,843
Best decision
I ever made.

642
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,137
Hank was a terrible partner.
Temperamental...

643
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,348
stubborn, impatient.

644
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,475
Sooner or later,
he just pushed everyone away.

645
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,018
Just the mediocrities.

646
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:07,229
Janet was the only one
who could endure him

647
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,396
and chose to stick it out.

648
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,481
Watch it, Bill.

649
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,066
She paid the price,
though, didn't she?

650
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,359
You son of a bitch.

651
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,694
I didn't come here
to listen to you two squabble.

652
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,279
I'm trying to save my mother.

653
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,282
Now, which office
would you say?

654
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,283
Oh, it's Woo.

655
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,661
Someone must have seen me.

656
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,037
Relax. If this is about you,

657
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,914
they'd be in your house
by now.

658
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,501
What are you, 15?

659
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:30,710
Come on.
We gotta go right now.

660
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,880
Wait. You might be able to
improvise that tracker...

661
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,465
if you modify
the diffraction units

662
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,633
on one of your regulators.

663
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,094
- That could work.
- I don't know what that means.

664
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,263
Thank you. Thank you.

665
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,151
But, Doctor,
campus police says

666
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,027
they ID'd both Pym
and Van Dyne.

667
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,487
I don't know
what to tell you, Agent.

668
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,531
I haven't talked to Hank
in 30 years.

669
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:00,740
I can assure you
I'm the last person

670
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,867
he would want to visit.

671
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,118
Oh, come on,
you expect us to...

672
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:03,785
Hey, hey.

673
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,537
Why is that?

674
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,874
Simple.
We hate each other's guts.

675
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,376
So I'm a terrible partner?

676
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,920
Foster, he hasn't had
one good idea

677
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,172
in his unremarkable career.

678
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,299
But his idea about the
diffractors could work, right?

679
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,259
Fine, one decent idea.

680
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,303
Except, I eliminated
the diffractors

681
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,263
when I upgraded the suits.

682
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,893
So, if we had an old suit,

683
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,061
we might be able
to track down the lab?

684
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,563
Yes, but we don't.

685
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,692
- What if we did?
What do you mean?

686
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,195
I mean...

687
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,447
life's funny.

688
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,574
Oh, my God.
You didn't destroy the suit.

689
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,575
What?

690
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,952
Well, it was
your life's work, Hank.

691
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,579
I couldn't destroy that.

692
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,165
Before I turned myself in,

693
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,416
I shrunk it down
and mailed it to Luis.

694
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,919
You sent my suit
through the mail?

695
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,087
Hey, the postal service
is very reliable.

696
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:59,466
You know, they do tracking
numbers now. Like UPS.

697
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:00,675
Where is it?

698
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:03,220
It's in a very safe place,
all right? Don't worry.

699
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:06,097
What, the trophy?
No, it's not here.

700
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,599
What do you mean it's not
there? Where could it be?

701
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,184
I looked everywhere.
It's not here.

702
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,560
Hey, get away from the plant.

703
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,687
But I put it back
after Cassie and I...

704
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,357
Show-and-tell.

705
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,483
Scotty?

706
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:19,611
No, stop!

707
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,489
Well, the good news is
I know where it is.

708
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,121
Whenever you go
back to school...

709
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,998
isn't everything supposed to
look so much smaller?

710
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,625
This place seems huge.

711
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:34,834
What is it?

712
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,002
It's the new regulator.

713
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,046
Hank, what's going on
with this suit?

714
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,756
How much of
a work in progress is this?

715
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,386
No, no, no.

716
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,770
Oh.

717
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,608
What are you, laughing?
Please, could you just...

718
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,235
Okay, okay.

719
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:04,656
What do you see?

720
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,908
The sizing coils
are malfunctioning.

721
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,410
Just let me...

722
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,248
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

723
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,253
Okay.
All right.

724
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,171
Try that.

725
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,302
Sorry.

726
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,304
What?

727
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,142
Awesome.

728
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,269
If only Cap could see you now.

729
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,438
Hilarious.
What are we gonna do?

730
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,658
Hey!

731
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:49,951
Where's your hall pass?

732
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,455
Hey, I'm talking to you.

733
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,166
Hey!

734
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,169
Hey.

735
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,695
You can do it.

736
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,947
You almost got it.

737
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,878
Oh, peanut.

738
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,850
Okay, let's go.

739
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:14,035
Hiya, champ,
how was school today?

740
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,539
All right, get your jokes out
now. Can you fix the suit?

741
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,165
So cranky.

742
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,918
You want a juice box
and some string cheese?

743
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:24,045
Do you really have that?

744
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,265
Let's see
if Foster was right.

745
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,238
This has gotta be the lab.

746
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,201
Let's go get it.

747
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:56,286
Yeah.

748
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,297
This seems right.

749
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:11,676
Look at us, teaming up twice
in one day.

750
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,303
Makes you think?

751
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,512
About what?

752
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,347
Germany.

753
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:17,390
What do you mean?

754
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,226
We were working together,
training together...

755
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,854
and other stuffing together.

756
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,356
If I had asked you,
would you have come?

757
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,066
I guess we'll never know.

758
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:28,776
But I do know one thing.

759
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:29,861
What?

760
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,780
If I had,
you'd have never been caught.

761
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,956
Hey, Scott.

762
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:44,375
You think you can stop
daydreaming about my daughter

763
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,960
long enough to get my lab?

764
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,962
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

765
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:55,136
Okay, you're transmitting.

766
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,387
What took you so long?

767
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,932
Sorry, I had to come
up with a name for my ant.

768
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,392
I'm thinking
Ulysses S. Gr-Ant.

769
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:02,852
You like it?

770
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,187
Hilarious.

771
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,981
<i>I'm not getting anything
on the monitors.</i>

772
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:09,317
There's some kind of
electronic disturbance.

773
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,443
<i>Be careful.</i>

774
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,111
You know me, Hank.
I'm always careful...

775
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:14,989
It's okay.
It's just the suit.

776
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,741
How do you know?
Look.

777
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,704
That's Ghost?

778
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,164
What is she doing?

779
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,415
Do you think
that suit is how

780
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,292
she goes through walls
and stuff?

781
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,336
Let's just get outta
here before she wakes up.

782
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,672
Hope,
look! There's the lab.

783
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,346
Now, we're sure
this is our shrunken building

784
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,389
and not
somebody else's, right?

785
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,683
Just take it, Scott.
Come on, we gotta be fast.

786
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:43,893
I'll get it.

787
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,980
Oh, shit...

788
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,036
Hope. Hope! Hank.

789
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,955
Guys.

790
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:06,332
I don't think
they can hear you.

791
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,169
Hi.

792
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,255
I'm Ava.

793
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:13,923
Scott.

794
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,927
So, you don't need the suit...

795
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,806
to go through things.

796
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,600
No.

797
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:27,478
It just helps me control it.

798
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:32,734
And the pain, supposedly.

799
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:38,531
You're not gonna reach
into my chest

800
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,949
and crush my heart, are you?

801
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,163
You're funny.

802
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:51,044
I'm not gonna hurt you, Scott,
unless I have to.

803
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,465
I need...

804
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,635
what's in your head.

805
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,983
Let's wake up
the rest of the gang

806
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,318
and get this over with,
shall we?

807
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,364
Get up!

808
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,157
Come on!

809
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,036
Dad?

810
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,290
Don't ever touch him again.

811
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:30,833
Now, now, Hope...

812
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:33,419
I think I'm being rather
gentle with your father,

813
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,712
all things considered.

814
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,423
What the hell
are you talking about?

815
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:41,636
Another casualty
of Hank Pym's ego.

816
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,013
Bill.

817
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:47,183
What have you done?

818
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,186
It's what you've done,
Dr. Pym.

819
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,063
You're with her?

820
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,482
Oh, man.
I thought you were cool.

821
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,234
What the hell
is going on here?

822
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,861
I doubt Hank has
ever mentioned my father.

823
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,322
Why would he?

824
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,574
Elihas Starr.

825
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:06,911
They were colleagues
at S.H.I.E.L.D.

826
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,413
Quantum research.

827
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:13,167
Until my father dare disagree
with the great Hank Pym.

828
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,002
You had him fired.

829
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,255
Oh, and discredited
for good measure.

830
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:24,721
My father tried to continue
his research on his own.

831
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:28,975
Desperate to restore his name,
so he took risks.

832
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,143
No, no, no!

833
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:32,186
Too many.

834
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,356
<i>Until something went wrong.</i>

835
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:37,859
He told us to run.

836
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:38,860
Elihas, what's happening?

837
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:40,445
Just go. Go!

838
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:42,822
Daddy! Daddy!

839
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,282
<i>I could tell
he was scared.</i>

840
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:50,705
Daddy!

841
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:51,956
Ava, no!

842
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:57,003
<i>I didn't want him
to be alone.</i>

843
00:45:58,464 --> 00:45:59,756
No! No!

844
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,766
<i>When I woke up,
my parents were dead.</i>

845
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,228
<i>I wasn't so lucky.</i>

846
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:22,028
<i>They call it
"molecular disequilibrium. "</i>

847
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,072
<i>A rather dull name, I think.</i>

848
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,117
<i>Doesn't quite do justice
to what it means.</i>

849
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:32,371
Every cell in my body
is torn apart...

850
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:34,081
and stitched back together.

851
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,584
Over and over.

852
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,377
Every day.

853
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,798
I was still at S.H.I.E.L.D.
when I got the call

854
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:44,592
about a quantum anomaly
in Argentina.

855
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:48,763
Hello, Ava.

856
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,516
My name's Bill.

857
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:54,143
I was a friend
of your father's.

858
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,605
I brought you something.

859
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,278
It's all right.
Try again.

860
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,073
That's it.

861
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:10,117
<i>Dr. Foster did his best
to keep me safe.</i>

862
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,286
But others at S.H.I.E.L.D.

863
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,997
saw an opportunity
in my affliction.

864
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,836
<i>They built me
a containment suit,</i>

865
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,462
<i>so I could control my phasing.</i>

866
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,965
<i>And trained me
to be a stealth operative.</i>

867
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,342
<i>They weaponized me.</i>

868
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,262
<i>I stole for them.
Spied for them.</i>

869
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,390
<i>Killed for them.</i>

870
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,976
And in exchange for my soul...

871
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,019
they were going to cure me.

872
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,108
They lied.

873
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:45,653
When S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed,
I took Ava in.

874
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,822
I built the chamber
to slow her decay,

875
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,073
but her condition
was progressive.

876
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,867
I didn't know how to cure it.

877
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,704
She wanted to kill you, Hank,
but I told her no...

878
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,080
and that she should
watch you instead.

879
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,707
And sure enough,
she discovered

880
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,041
that you were
building the tunnel.

881
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,170
Then, she told me about Lang.

882
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:05,798
And the message from Janet
inside his head,

883
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,258
that's when I...

884
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:08,426
Christ's sake!

885
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,969
That's me. I'm sorry.

886
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,637
Look, can you tell me
who's texting me?

887
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,390
"Cassie, 911."

888
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,475
That's my daughter.
I need to text her back.

889
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:17,894
No, that's not happening.

890
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,937
What, it's 911.
That means it's an emergency.

891
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:21,772
You're not making
demands here, Lang.

892
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,900
You're not appreciating
the gravity of the...

893
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,694
Okay, look, she's trying
to video chat me now.

894
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:29,655
Something might be wrong.
Let me talk to her. Please.

895
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,035
Cassie, are you okay?
What's the emergency?

896
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:35,912
<i>I can't find my soccer shoes.</i>

897
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,038
What?

898
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:38,289
<i>I have a game tomorrow.</i>

899
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:39,498
<i>Hey, Scott,
I know that they're there.</i>

900
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,042
<i>Can you just walk the phone
around the house?</i>

901
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:42,585
No, I can't do that right now.

902
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,503
<i>- Why not?
- Because I'm sick.</i>

903
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,713
<i>Hey, can youjust
maybe look around</i>

904
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:46,714
<i>later then and call me back?</i>

905
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,215
<i>Please? Thank you.</i>

906
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,592
<i>Bye, Daddy!</i>

907
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,510
<i>- Bye, peanut!
- Feel better!</i>

908
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:52,678
<i>Feel better, buddy!</i>

909
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:55,556
I'm sorry.
It said emergency.

910
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,558
Ava, I want to help you.

911
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:59,727
She doesn't need your help.
I know how to save her.

912
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,103
Oh, really? How?

913
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,271
Janet.

914
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:03,898
For the last 30 years,
she's been down there

915
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:04,982
absorbing quantum energy.

916
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,525
We can extract that energy.

917
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,986
We can use it to repair
Ava's molecular structure...

918
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:09,987
Extract it?

919
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:11,238
- Yes.
- Are you insane?

920
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:12,990
That would rip Janet apart.

921
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:15,993
You don't know that.
I'm gonna fire up your tunnel.

922
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:17,453
When Janet's location

923
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:18,871
pops into Lang's head,
he's gonna give it to me...

924
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,831
or I'm gonna turn him over
to the FBI.

925
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:21,666
What?

926
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,584
You are gonna
stay here...

927
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,753
just in case I need your help.

928
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,089
Like hell I would help you!

929
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:29,423
You'll do whatever I say.

930
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:30,633
You're gonna kill Janet!

931
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,635
I'd be more worried
about yourself, Hank.

932
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,262
Goddamn it, Bill!

933
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:37,181
Dad?
- Calm down, Hank.

934
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,058
So help me God...

935
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,768
The pills.

936
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,436
It's his heart!
He needs his pills.

937
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:45,481
Please, Dr. Foster.
They're in the tin. Please.

938
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,234
He could die!

939
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,443
Come on!

940
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:50,444
Help him!

941
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,196
Dad, just hang on,
all right?

942
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,572
Just keep breathing.
Stay calm.

943
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,032
Help him, man! Come on!

944
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,075
The Altoid tin!

945
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,245
Wait!

946
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,500
Thanks, guys.

947
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:06,460
Hank!

948
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,975
Bill is filling
that girl's head with lies.

949
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:24,353
Elihas Starr was a traitor.
He stole my plans.

950
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:26,897
Now, bring it down.
All right, lock it in.

951
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:29,608
No, no, no.
The bolt is on the other side.

952
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:32,528
Tighten that one down,
then bring it down one notch.

953
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:33,654
Good job.

954
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:35,072
It'll work.

955
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,241
Foster, he could have fried
the entire system.

956
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,576
Look, we'll adjust the relays

957
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,453
while you go reprogram
the settings, all right?

958
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,246
It's going to be fine.

959
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:49,128
So, this is it.

960
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,255
Yeah. You'd think
with all this time

961
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:52,882
to prepare I'd be more ready.

962
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,968
Oh, going subatomic isn't
something you can prepare for.

963
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,512
It kind of melts your mind.

964
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,514
I mean seeing my mom again.

965
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:01,849
Oh.

966
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,728
What if she's a completely
different person?

967
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,314
Yeah, like, George Washington.

968
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:09,857
I'm serious, Scott.

969
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,068
Or George Jefferson.

970
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,946
What if she's forgotten
about me?

971
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,158
When I was in prison...

972
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,869
the only thing that got me
through was Cassie.

973
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,287
I could have been locked up
for 100 years...

974
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,789
I never would have
forgotten her.

975
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,085
I know your mom
is counting the minutes

976
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,128
until she can see you again.

977
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:33,881
Thank you.

978
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,223
Hey.

979
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:43,724
We got a big problem.

980
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:44,809
You forgot
the motion sensor lights

981
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:45,684
on the back of the building.

982
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:47,311
Oh, no.

983
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:48,979
And they're on the proposal,

984
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,564
and Karapetyan
asked for them specifically.

985
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:54,110
Yeah, look,
it's been a little crazy.

986
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,821
Look, maybe I could stop by
tomorrow, take a look at it.

987
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:57,863
No. No, no, no, no.

988
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,198
The meeting is first thing
in the morning.

989
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,449
You gotta come right now
and fix it.

990
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:02,868
I can't. I wish I could,
but I can't leave.

991
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,036
You know what,
I'm coming to you.

992
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,622
I'll just bring the plans.
They're on the laptop.

993
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,082
And you can fix them there.

994
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,458
Just tell me
where you are, okay?

995
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:10,543
It's complicated.

996
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,002
What do you mean
it's complicated?

997
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:18,134
As you can see, sir,

998
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,261
this system
is state of the art.

999
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:22,680
Security of tomorrow, today.

1000
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:24,014
Oh, that's so good!

1001
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,683
And I love the lean-in, bro.
Keep practicin'.

1002
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:26,809
Hey, I just gotta
drive up to Scotty's,

1003
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:27,810
so we can fix the plans.

1004
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,395
But don't worry, I'll be back
in plenty of time.

1005
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,856
As you can see...
- Oh, oh, oh!

1006
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,316
Tell me you got the van washed
for tomorrow morning.

1007
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:36,026
Down to the undercarriage,
baby.

1008
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,528
You sprung
for the undercarriage wash?

1009
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:38,904
Well, you said get the works.

1010
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:41,157
That's a scam, bro. We live
in California, not Minnesota.

1011
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:42,491
He's right.

1012
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:45,369
The undercarriage wash,

1013
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:46,954
that's for cleaning
off road salt...

1014
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:50,332
laid down in our
more snow-laden sister states.

1015
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,667
Who are you,
and why do you know so much

1016
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:52,960
about car wash protocol?

1017
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:55,462
Well, my name is Sonny Burch.

1018
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,132
And I do my research, Luis.

1019
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:02,678
To wit, I have learned
from a friend of mine...

1020
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,471
at the FBI that you are

1021
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,182
a known associate
of Scott Lang...

1022
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,310
a known associate of Hank Pym,
who I've also learned...

1023
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:12,104
has a portable
shrinking laboratory...

1024
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,648
filled with
all kinds of juicy tech.

1025
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:17,484
And you're gonna tell me
where it is.

1026
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:19,153
Well, I hate to
break it to you,

1027
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,363
but I don't know
what you're talking about.

1028
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,450
Well, I sense a resistance
in you, Luis.

1029
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:27,494
And I have promised results
to some dangerous people.

1030
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:31,498
So, I'm gonna introduce you
to my good friend, Uzman.

1031
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:34,043
Now...

1032
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,045
Uzman is a master

1033
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:38,172
at extracting information
from the unwilling...

1034
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,798
through psychoactive means.

1035
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:43,135
Oh, is that truth serum?

1036
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,721
There's no such thing
as truth serum.

1037
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,223
That's just nonsense from TV.

1038
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,016
Well, what is it then?

1039
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:50,768
It's a little concoction

1040
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:53,562
that he's been perfecting
since his days with the S.I.S.

1041
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,607
It makes you suggestible
and highly responsive.

1042
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:57,816
Well, dude,
that's truth serum.

1043
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:58,651
No, it's not.

1044
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:01,820
No offensing, but they sound
like truth serum to me.

1045
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:04,031
- Right?
- It's not a truth serum.

1046
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,532
Okay. Hey, I believe you.

1047
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,909
It's not a truth serum.

1048
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:10,371
I mean, if it walk like duck
and talk like ducks...

1049
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:11,580
The truth serum.

1050
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,499
Well, I have
a lot of allergies...

1051
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,501
so you might wanna think
about that.

1052
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,130
We've got to get
that lab back.

1053
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:22,383
What?

1054
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,719
The chamber and the suit
are barely helping anymore.

1055
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,098
How long have I got?

1056
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,978
A couple of weeks, maybe.

1057
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:38,565
Well, then we'll make them
bring the lab back.

1058
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:39,692
How?

1059
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,112
Lang. He has
a daughter, right?

1060
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,321
You can't mean that.

1061
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:45,864
Ava!

1062
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,660
I tolerate a lot of the things
you do out there...

1063
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,662
but I won't be a part
of anything like that.

1064
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,372
You're not the one who's about

1065
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,207
to fade away
into nothing, Bill.

1066
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,417
I am!

1067
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,086
You said you could fix me!

1068
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,424
You promised.

1069
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:05,426
I know. I will.

1070
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:06,885
But not like that.

1071
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,473
You lay one finger
on that little girl...

1072
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,435
I won't help you.
And we're done.

1073
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:21,692
Fine.

1074
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,653
There are other options.

1075
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,669
You know what? You're right.
This isn't truth serum.

1076
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,046
Because I don't feel anything.

1077
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,922
That was a lie.
I do feel something.

1078
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:44,965
This is truth serum!

1079
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:46,091
There's no such thing!

1080
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:47,801
Okay.

1081
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:50,137
Okay, okay.

1082
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,598
Now, I'm gonna make this
real easy for you, Luis.

1083
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:54,183
Okay.

1084
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:59,313
Where is Scott Lang?

1085
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:00,856
Well, see, that's complicated.

1086
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,816
Because when I first met
Scotty, he was in a bad place.

1087
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:04,443
<i>And I'm not talkin'
about cell block D.</i>

1088
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,111
<i>His wife had just filed for
divorce, and I was, like...</i>

1089
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,197
<i>"Damn, homie. She dumped you
when you're on lockup?"</i>

1090
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,323
<i>And he was, like,
"Yeah, I know.</i>

1091
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:10,324
<i>"I thought I was gonna be
with her forever...</i>

1092
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:11,450
<i>"but now I'm all alone. "</i>

1093
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:12,659
<i>And I was, like, "Damn, homie.
You know what?</i>

1094
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,078
<i>"You gotta chin up, because
you'll find a new partner.</i>

1095
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:15,496
<i>"But you know what? I'm Luis. "</i>

1096
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:16,747
<i>And he says,
"You know what? I'm Scotty,</i>

1097
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:17,873
<i>"and we're gonna be
best friends. "</i>

1098
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:18,916
Okay, hold on, hold on.

1099
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,626
I like a good story
as much as the next person...

1100
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:21,960
but what in the hell
does this have to do

1101
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,212
with where Scott Lang is?

1102
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,213
I'm getting there.
I'm getting there.

1103
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,631
You put a dime in him,

1104
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:26,924
you gotta let the whole song
play out.

1105
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:28,801
He like human jukebox.

1106
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:30,636
Oh, my abuelita had a jukebox
in the restaurant!

1107
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:33,013
<i>Yeah, only played Morrissey.</i>

1108
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:34,640
<i>And if anybody ever
complained, she'd be like...</i>

1109
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,309
<i>You know, Chicanos,
we call him "Moz. "</i>

1110
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:38,435
Then, iadios!

1111
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:39,978
What can I say?
We relate to his

1112
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,397
melancholy ballads,
you know?

1113
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:42,815
- Lang!
- Right, right, right.

1114
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,024
So, anyway,
Scotty gets out of jail,

1115
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:45,067
and he starts working
for Hank.

1116
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,402
<i>That's when he met Hope.
And Hope's all, like...</i>

1117
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:47,903
<i>"I want nothing to do
with you.</i>

1118
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:49,613
<i>"Look at my hairdo,
I'm all business. "</i>

1119
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:50,739
<i>And then Scotty's, like,</i>

1120
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:51,824
<i>"You know what, girl?
My heart is all broken.</i>

1121
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,033
<i>"And I'll probably
never find love again,</i>

1122
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,243
<i>"but damn
if I want to kiss you!"</i>

1123
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:55,369
<i>But then you fast forward</i>

1124
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:56,412
<i>and they're all
into each other, right?</i>

1125
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:57,454
<i>And then Scotty's, like,</i>

1126
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:58,789
<i>"You know what?
I can't tell you this...</i>

1127
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,874
<i>"but I'm gonna go trash an
airport with Captain America. "</i>

1128
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:02,626
<i>And then she said, "I can't
believe you split like that!</i>

1129
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,253
<i>"Smell you later, dummy. "</i>

1130
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:05,462
So, Scotty goes
on house arrest.

1131
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,131
<i>And he won't admit it,
but his heart is all, like...</i>

1132
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:08,715
<i>"Damn! I thought
Hope coulda been</i>

1133
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,551
<i>"my new true partner,
but I blew it!"</i>

1134
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:11,718
<i>But fate brought 'em
back together.</i>

1135
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:12,845
And then Hope's heart
is all...

1136
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:14,596
<i>"I'm worried
that I can't trust him...</i>

1137
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,348
<i>"and he's gonna screw up
again, and ruin everything!"</i>

1138
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:17,724
And then
my heart is all, like...

1139
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:19,643
<i>"That fancy raspberry filling
represents the company's red</i>

1140
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,520
<i>"and we're days away from
going out of business. Oh!"</i>

1141
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:22,521
"Out of business"?

1142
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:23,564
"Days away"?

1143
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:24,690
Damn truth serum!

1144
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,900
I was trying to protect
you guys. I swear to God.

1145
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:28,944
I was trying to be
a good boss, but we're broke!

1146
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:29,945
And the Karapetyan's
our last hope.

1147
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:30,946
And if we don't show up,
we're done!

1148
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,239
That's terrible bossing!

1149
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:33,282
Damn, bro!

1150
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,450
- That's on me! That's on me!
Hey!

1151
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,202
Enough.

1152
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:41,373
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

1153
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,042
Where is Scott Lang?

1154
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,169
I've been trying to tell you,

1155
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,211
he's in a tricky spot,
emotionally speaking.

1156
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:47,713
Emotionally speaking.

1157
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:50,924
Well, where is Scott Lang,
literally speaking!

1158
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:52,342
Oh!
The woods.

1159
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,552
The woods?

1160
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,262
Baba Yaga!

1161
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,973
What do you mean, "the woods"?

1162
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,224
The Muir Woods,
the second fire road

1163
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,434
off the Panoramic Highway!

1164
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:01,727
For God's sake!

1165
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:05,397
<i>Baba Yaga, come at night</i>

1166
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,816
<i>Little children, sleepy tight</i>

1167
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:11,737
Damn it!

1168
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:14,781
If that freak
gets Pym's tech...

1169
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:16,492
I'm never gonna see it.

1170
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:17,701
So, what do we do now?

1171
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,746
It's easier to steal it
from the Feds

1172
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,164
than from the boogeyman.

1173
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:27,753
Hey, it's me. How'd you like
to get a promotion?

1174
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:31,632
I got the location on Pym,
Van Dyne and Lang.

1175
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:33,050
But you gonna
have to take 'em down now,

1176
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:34,885
because they ain't gonna
be there for long.

1177
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:37,095
And when you do,
you gonna get me that lab.

1178
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:39,389
Understood.

1179
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,184
Good news, gentlemen.

1180
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,561
Feds are gonna do
the hard work for us.

1181
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,105
What are you lookin' at?
Change my tires!

1182
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:48,106
Right.

1183
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:52,694
Sir.
- Can you knock?

1184
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:55,906
Sorry, sir.
But I just got a lead.

1185
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:58,867
Ooh, I love leads.

1186
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:06,833
System's in the green.

1187
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:08,585
Priming the coils.

1188
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:12,005
Full charge.

1189
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:13,173
As soon
as the tunnel's open...

1190
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,424
let us know
if you get anything

1191
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:15,467
that could be a part of
her message.

1192
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:16,969
Yeah, yeah. I will.

1193
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:20,639
Okay, then.

1194
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,268
Here it goes.

1195
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:39,741
We did it!

1196
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:41,785
You got anything?

1197
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:45,914
Nothin'.

1198
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,792
Well, just give it a minute,
because it could...

1199
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:51,461
No.

1200
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:53,213
No, no, no, no!

1201
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:54,256
What's happening?

1202
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,133
It's shutting down.
Maybe our vectors are off.

1203
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:58,594
We've gone over them a million
times, I know they're right!

1204
00:59:58,761 --> 00:59:59,678
Then what else
could it be?

1205
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:01,638
I don't know!

1206
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,062
- Scott, what are you doing?
- Scott, get away from that!

1207
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:10,105
Scott, you can't...

1208
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,940
I'm sorry, I don't know
how much time I have.

1209
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:13,317
I need to fix the algorithm.

1210
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,863
Trust me,
after 30 years down here...

1211
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,698
I've thought about it a lot.

1212
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:25,203
Janet?

1213
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,458
Hi, honey.

1214
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,379
Jellybean.

1215
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,173
Mom?

1216
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,800
It's not the reunion
I'd imagined.

1217
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,719
It's all so rushed.

1218
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:43,180
You two have done
such great work.

1219
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:45,307
You just need a little...

1220
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:47,017
nudge.

1221
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:04,743
Janet,
how is this possible?

1222
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:07,704
It wasn't a message you put

1223
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:09,122
in Scott's head.
It was an antenna.

1224
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:10,832
Clever girl.

1225
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:13,335
I'm so proud of you.

1226
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,212
Honey, tell us where you are.

1227
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,963
Tell us how to find you.

1228
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:18,965
No, the probability fields
are too complex.

1229
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:20,467
That's why I needed
to talk to you.

1230
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,052
You have to follow my voice.

1231
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:23,553
Of course!

1232
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:25,597
Like tracing a call
back to its source!

1233
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:33,689
I'm tracking your signal
using subatomic frequencies...

1234
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:36,108
between point two
and point nine.

1235
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:37,818
I'd narrow it to four and six.

1236
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:39,111
That's too tight.
We could miss you.

1237
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:40,862
Look at us squabbling again.

1238
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:44,449
Fine. All right,
between three and seven.

1239
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:47,994
Our first fight in decades,
and it's over just like that.

1240
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:04,136
Bullseye.

1241
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:05,887
Source lock.

1242
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,556
It's you.

1243
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,766
We got it!

1244
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,477
You have to meet me
at these exact coordinates.

1245
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:15,147
In the wasteland,
beyond the quantum void.

1246
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:16,481
It's very dangerous,

1247
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,608
especially on the human mind,
so be careful.

1248
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:21,319
Time and space work very
differently down here.

1249
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:22,863
You have two hours.

1250
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:24,698
After that, the probability
fields will shift...

1251
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:25,824
and it'll be another century

1252
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:27,367
before they align
like this again.

1253
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:29,536
We'll find you.

1254
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:38,378
I know you will, Jellybean.

1255
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:44,426
Nope.

1256
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,428
Nothing. I got nothing.
No sign of Janet.

1257
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:47,637
Perfect.

1258
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,099
How did we get up here?

1259
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:57,689
All right, first you're gonna
see all kinds of lights...

1260
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:58,982
and it's gonna get
really trippy...

1261
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,860
but then it's gonna turn black
and silent. Really silent.

1262
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:03,487
Scott, I'll be fine.

1263
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:05,155
I'm just saying
because I've been down there.

1264
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:06,656
Yeah, so you've mentioned.

1265
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,703
Sorry.
I have to take this.

1266
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:14,289
<i>Hey, man, you coming?</i>

1267
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,041
No, I'm not,
but you know what? Ghost is.

1268
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,293
And you know what? The Feds,
they know where you are.

1269
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:19,711
<i>- What?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</i>

1270
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:21,129
They gave me
some truth serum.

1271
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:22,088
And then all of a sudden

1272
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:23,340
I started talkin'
all honestly.

1273
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:25,133
Like, I hate the way
that you load the dishwasher.

1274
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:26,426
<i>I hate it, I hate it.</i>

1275
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:27,427
<i>But you need to go home...</i>

1276
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:29,054
because the Feds
are probably going there now!

1277
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:30,096
And by the way...

1278
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:32,891
who puts the plates on the top
rack? They don't go there!

1279
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:43,902
I feel like such a jerk.

1280
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,404
You're gonna be really mad.
We gotta go now.

1281
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:47,489
What?

1282
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,699
Ghost knows where we are.
So does the FBI.

1283
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:50,951
How?

1284
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:53,036
- I told Luis where we are.
- You what?

1285
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:54,204
I told him to come here
so I could help him

1286
01:03:54,288 --> 01:03:55,413
with the Karapetyan proposal.

1287
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:56,665
Oh, my God!

1288
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,834
Look, we need
to land that account.

1289
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:00,126
Otherwise,
we lose the business!

1290
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:01,169
Do you know hard it is
for ex-cons

1291
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:02,087
to find work these days?

1292
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:03,630
Jesus, Scott!

1293
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:14,766
90 seconds to close
the aperture!

1294
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:16,685
You have to depolarize
the coils first!

1295
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:17,561
I know!

1296
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:19,187
I'm really sorry...

1297
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:22,524
but the, FBI
is coming to my place so...

1298
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,150
I have to go.

1299
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:27,612
Can I borrow the suit?

1300
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:30,490
<i>Gyroscopic stabilizers.</i>

1301
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:32,367
<i>Powering on.</i>

1302
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:34,452
I'm just gonna borrow
the suit.

1303
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:36,872
I'll come back.
Just tell me where you'll be.

1304
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,582
- Don't bother.
- What?

1305
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:39,833
We'll come
and get the suit from you,

1306
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:41,001
as soon as we've found my mom.

1307
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:43,336
- Hope...
- Scott, just go!

1308
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,522
- Scott?
- Daddy?

1309
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:03,773
It's us, buddy!

1310
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:06,151
We're here for Cassie's shoes!

1311
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:07,694
He must be resting.

1312
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:08,945
Honey, why don't you
go upstairs

1313
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:10,113
and look under your bed?

1314
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,449
Daddy, you upstairs?

1315
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:15,035
Daddy?

1316
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:17,245
What the...

1317
01:05:18,497 --> 01:05:20,999
He really lives
like a pig these days.

1318
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:25,378
Daddy?

1319
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:34,638
Spread out!

1320
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:35,889
Again?

1321
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:37,349
You people have no shame!

1322
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,351
The monitor says
that he's in the bathroom.

1323
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:40,477
Yeah, I'm not buying it!

1324
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:45,190
Cassie, let the man get by!

1325
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:46,900
But Daddy's super sick!

1326
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,276
I'll see about that!

1327
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,320
He says he doesn't want
anyone else to get sick!

1328
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:51,738
I'll take my chances, sweetie.

1329
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:54,115
He barfed. Like, a lot.

1330
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:55,742
Young lady,
I'm a federal agent.

1331
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,911
I've seen worse things
than vomit.

1332
01:05:58,704 --> 01:05:59,704
Like, "a lot" a lot?

1333
01:05:59,872 --> 01:06:01,581
- Yes!
- Forget it, move aside!

1334
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:02,999
No!

1335
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,505
Woo!

1336
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:12,258
- What are you doing here?
- Scott.

1337
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:16,429
I'm sorry,
I'm just really sick.

1338
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:17,722
I told you.

1339
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:19,182
Excuse me.

1340
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,851
Sometimes you gotta just
get it out. You know?

1341
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:23,311
Sorry.

1342
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,528
I'll start the van.

1343
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:33,863
You get the lab.

1344
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,201
Freeze!
You're surrounded!

1345
01:06:52,216 --> 01:06:53,717
Hank Pym...

1346
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:55,301
Hope Van Dyne...

1347
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:56,636
you're under arrest.

1348
01:06:58,639 --> 01:06:59,514
This is harassment!

1349
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:00,807
Actually, it's not.

1350
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:02,434
What does the FBI
even stand for...

1351
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:04,978
"Forever
Bothering Individuals"?

1352
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:08,481
His monitor check out?
- Of course it does.

1353
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:10,358
Damn it!

1354
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:12,902
Looks like I just got fed
a bowl of malarkey.

1355
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:15,155
We got 'em sir. Pym
and Van Dyne are in custody.

1356
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:17,490
Seriously? Yes!

1357
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:20,535
Oh, I'm sorry, Scott.

1358
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:22,328
They're your friends.
That's insensitive.

1359
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:24,748
I just really needed a win,
you know?

1360
01:07:25,082 --> 01:07:26,416
Anyway, I'll be back later

1361
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:27,792
for the official end
of your sentence!

1362
01:07:28,335 --> 01:07:29,878
Sorry for misjudging you, pal!

1363
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:32,088
You should feel great
about yourself!

1364
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:56,946
What is it?

1365
01:07:57,114 --> 01:07:58,073
We have a man down.

1366
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,991
And Pym's lab is gone.

1367
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:09,250
Hey.

1368
01:08:11,128 --> 01:08:12,837
Thanks for covering for me.

1369
01:08:13,005 --> 01:08:14,047
Sure.

1370
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:18,093
So...

1371
01:08:18,552 --> 01:08:21,346
how long
have you been Ant-Man again?

1372
01:08:25,142 --> 01:08:26,601
Not long.

1373
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:28,436
It just sort of happened.

1374
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,271
I'm sorry for lying to you...

1375
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,148
and I'm sorry
for risking everything.

1376
01:08:32,316 --> 01:08:33,233
Daddy, it's okay.

1377
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,526
It's not.

1378
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:36,945
I do some dumb things...

1379
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,405
and the people that I love
the most pay the price.

1380
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:40,573
Mainly you.

1381
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:42,992
Trying to help people
isn't dumb.

1382
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:47,455
I screw it up
just about every time.

1383
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:50,834
So, maybe you just need
someone watching your back...

1384
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:52,252
like a partner.

1385
01:08:52,419 --> 01:08:53,336
Well, she's made it clear

1386
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:54,754
that's about the last thing
she wants.

1387
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:56,047
Who?

1388
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:57,507
Hope.

1389
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:01,261
Wait, who did you think?

1390
01:09:01,428 --> 01:09:02,303
Me.

1391
01:09:02,763 --> 01:09:03,888
You?

1392
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:05,557
Don't laugh.

1393
01:09:06,016 --> 01:09:07,392
I'd be a great partner.

1394
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:09,269
Peanut.

1395
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:13,648
You would be awesome.
And if I let you...

1396
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:16,025
I would be a terrible dad.

1397
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,694
Fine.

1398
01:09:17,903 --> 01:09:20,572
Then have Hope be
your partner. She's smart.

1399
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:23,783
She reminds me of you.

1400
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:26,452
You gonna go help her?

1401
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:28,621
I think you should help her.

1402
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:30,790
I wish I could...

1403
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:34,502
but I don't know how I could
help her without hurting you.

1404
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,382
You can do it.

1405
01:09:39,758 --> 01:09:41,801
You can do anything.

1406
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:45,013
You are the world's
greatest grandma.

1407
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:54,522
Agent Woo will see you
in an hour.

1408
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:56,649
An hour?
We don't have an hour.

1409
01:09:56,817 --> 01:09:59,068
Oh, you got
somewhere else to be?

1410
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:08,953
Oh, now, that's my girl.

1411
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:17,503
All right, what's our plan?

1412
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:20,882
To shrink that wall.

1413
01:10:21,258 --> 01:10:22,258
It looks load-bearing.

1414
01:10:22,426 --> 01:10:23,593
The ceiling could collapse.

1415
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:25,261
Then we run like hell.

1416
01:10:25,429 --> 01:10:27,597
Now, I estimate 15-20 agents
on the floor.

1417
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:29,599
Roughly five times that
in the building at large.

1418
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:31,059
They're all heavily armed.

1419
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:32,352
Not great odds.

1420
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:34,187
You got any better ideas?

1421
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:35,355
Nope.

1422
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:38,107
And I'm not giving up on Mom.

1423
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:40,235
She'd be so proud of you.

1424
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:46,658
Okay.

1425
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:48,952
One...

1426
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:50,620
two...

1427
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:56,793
Scott?

1428
01:10:57,002 --> 01:10:58,586
What're you two
just standing around for?

1429
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:00,213
We gotta go find that lab.

1430
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:02,173
What about me?

1431
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:04,717
Perfect.

1432
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:06,636
Hurry up and get dressed.
We don't have much time.

1433
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:21,442
Okay, now what?

1434
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:23,152
You're asking me?

1435
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:26,948
Get in!

1436
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:34,872
Hi.

1437
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:40,670
Excuse me. Are we planning
on leaving soon...

1438
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:42,588
or are you two gonna keep
staring at each other...

1439
01:11:42,756 --> 01:11:44,674
until they start shooting
at us?

1440
01:11:45,175 --> 01:11:46,592
Yeah.

1441
01:11:51,348 --> 01:11:52,682
- Hey, Burch.
Yeah.

1442
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:53,766
Yeah, they're out.

1443
01:11:53,934 --> 01:11:55,268
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

1444
01:12:00,065 --> 01:12:01,482
Her suit is missing,
and so is the van.

1445
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:02,817
How could this happen?

1446
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,694
I mean, what the dickens?

1447
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:08,489
Thank you.

1448
01:12:09,366 --> 01:12:10,491
You're welcome.

1449
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:14,579
So, how do we find the lab?

1450
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:15,997
After we lost it
the first time...

1451
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,958
I put on a new tracker...

1452
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:20,793
of sorts.

1453
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:31,220
That'll work.

1454
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,749
Is it ready or not?

1455
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,794
We can begin
the extraction process.

1456
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:04,879
Listen, Ava.

1457
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,756
This whole thing
could be very dangerous.

1458
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:08,758
Maybe we should...

1459
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:11,469
Maybe we should what? Wait?

1460
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:13,763
I've got days until I'm dead.

1461
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:17,433
We're doing this, Bill. Now.

1462
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:23,606
Energy readings show they
have not used the tunnel yet.

1463
01:13:23,774 --> 01:13:24,941
We don't have much time before

1464
01:13:25,025 --> 01:13:26,150
Mom's location shifts,
and we lose her.

1465
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:28,152
Yeah, and we have
a lot to do before then.

1466
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:30,238
You know,
my pep-pep always said,

1467
01:13:30,322 --> 01:13:32,156
"If you want to do something
right, you make a list. "

1468
01:13:32,324 --> 01:13:33,491
So, we should do that.

1469
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:35,785
One, we have to break
into that lab.

1470
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:38,413
Two, we have to kick out
Foster and Ghost.

1471
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:40,706
Three, we're gonna
have to fight Ghost.

1472
01:13:40,874 --> 01:13:43,292
That seems like it should be
part of two. 2-A, all right?

1473
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:45,002
Let's call it 2-A.

1474
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:46,504
Fight Ghost. 2-A.

1475
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:48,214
Oh, also, we have to make sure
that the lab

1476
01:13:48,298 --> 01:13:49,590
is fully grown
for you to come back.

1477
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:50,758
Otherwise, we're screwed.

1478
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:51,634
Scott!

1479
01:13:51,802 --> 01:13:52,677
You want me to start again?
I'll start again...

1480
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:54,554
I'm going to dive.

1481
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:58,474
The only chance we got is if
the two of you are out here...

1482
01:13:58,642 --> 01:14:01,769
together,
protecting the tunnel.

1483
01:14:02,354 --> 01:14:04,772
Let me do this, Hope. Please.

1484
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:08,317
Let me get her.

1485
01:14:09,653 --> 01:14:11,612
I think he's right.

1486
01:14:18,745 --> 01:14:20,913
"Whassup?"

1487
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:25,626
You don't remember,
that beloved commercial?

1488
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:27,712
"Whassup?"

1489
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:30,548
I had him follow us.

1490
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:33,593
I thought we could use
some help.

1491
01:14:35,095 --> 01:14:36,387
All right.
I'm in position.

1492
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:37,597
The ants are headed in.

1493
01:14:37,764 --> 01:14:38,973
Copy that.

1494
01:14:39,057 --> 01:14:40,224
<i>Keep your eyes peeled,
Scotty.</i>

1495
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:43,227
- Do you want Pez?
- No.

1496
01:14:43,937 --> 01:14:45,480
Cassie gave me this
for my birthday.

1497
01:14:46,106 --> 01:14:48,065
By the way, I love that suit!

1498
01:14:48,525 --> 01:14:50,193
Thanks, man.

1499
01:14:50,777 --> 01:14:53,279
I wish I had a suit.

1500
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:57,575
I would even like a suit
with minimal powers, you know?

1501
01:14:57,743 --> 01:15:01,412
Or maybe even just a suit,
with no powers.

1502
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:17,220
What is it?

1503
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:20,056
Don't know.

1504
01:15:23,977 --> 01:15:25,061
It's them!

1505
01:15:27,981 --> 01:15:29,065
They can't be far.

1506
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:52,838
All right, Hank. Hank?

1507
01:15:55,259 --> 01:15:56,676
Dad, what's your status?

1508
01:15:56,843 --> 01:15:58,761
Foster's taken care of.

1509
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:00,471
Suiting up now.

1510
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,644
I just wanted to save Ava.

1511
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:09,438
She's facing death or
something far more terrible.

1512
01:16:09,606 --> 01:16:10,648
She's afraid.

1513
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:14,569
I'll help you find a cure
when I get back.

1514
01:16:14,778 --> 01:16:16,320
I promise.

1515
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:18,990
Together, we'll figure
something out.

1516
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:22,702
Good luck, Hank.

1517
01:16:23,203 --> 01:16:24,829
Thanks, Bill.

1518
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:28,207
Now, I'm gonna need you
to step back.

1519
01:16:45,225 --> 01:16:48,728
<i>Time remaining, 15 minutes.</i>

1520
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:51,689
Hank's in, Scott.

1521
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:52,773
<i>Any sign of her?</i>

1522
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:54,066
No, nothing yet.

1523
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:01,240
Ava!

1524
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:06,120
Call off the ants, Scott.

1525
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:07,455
Oh, boy!

1526
01:17:31,104 --> 01:17:32,146
Can I get a status report?

1527
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:33,814
'Cause I got some
serious Ghost problems here!

1528
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:38,444
Ready to dive.

1529
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:47,203
- In case I don't make it...
Don't.

1530
01:17:47,537 --> 01:17:48,954
Don't say that.

1531
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:51,332
<i>I can't lose you, too.</i>

1532
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,792
I love you, Hope.

1533
01:17:54,544 --> 01:17:56,629
Guys,
everything's bad over here.

1534
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:13,854
Now.

1535
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:24,990
Misdirection.

1536
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:26,659
One of the first things
they teach you

1537
01:18:26,743 --> 01:18:29,120
at Online Close-up
Magic University.

1538
01:18:31,081 --> 01:18:31,914
No!

1539
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:36,961
Plan worked.
We got it, Scotty!

1540
01:18:38,004 --> 01:18:39,088
Meet us
at the rendezvous point.

1541
01:18:39,256 --> 01:18:40,548
Okay, on my way!

1542
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:41,632
Oh, no.

1543
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:47,847
Really?
This guy again?

1544
01:18:48,014 --> 01:18:49,098
Who?

1545
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:51,267
I told you
our business wasn't over.

1546
01:18:53,311 --> 01:18:54,562
Change of plans.

1547
01:18:58,191 --> 01:18:58,983
Hang on.

1548
01:19:08,368 --> 01:19:10,369
I want that lab, boys,
whatever it takes.

1549
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:21,005
Hold on.

1550
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,645
That undercarriage is filthy!

1551
01:19:36,813 --> 01:19:38,230
Oh, they got bigger problems.

1552
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:44,653
Hope, what're you doing?

1553
01:19:44,821 --> 01:19:46,071
You're heading away
from the rendezvous point!

1554
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:47,323
Don't worry,

1555
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:48,491
<i>I'm taking these guys
on the scenic route.</i>

1556
01:19:48,658 --> 01:19:50,701
Wait, what're you... Oh.

1557
01:20:10,388 --> 01:20:12,348
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
We're gonna die!

1558
01:20:13,099 --> 01:20:14,642
We're gonna die!

1559
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:28,572
Signal lost.

1560
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:31,075
What the hell
are they doing up there?

1561
01:20:33,703 --> 01:20:35,079
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

1562
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:52,179
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

1563
01:20:53,473 --> 01:20:57,142
You never said
it was so beautiful, Scott.

1564
01:21:02,315 --> 01:21:03,899
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

1565
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:09,738
Okay, any time now.

01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:12,157
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

1567

<i>- Recalibrating.

1568
01:21:17,414 --> 01:21:19,790
<i>Signal restored.</i>

1569
01:21:32,596 --> 01:21:34,138
Bikes, it's all you.

1570
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:39,476
- Take the wheel.
- What? Wait!

1571
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:52,615
Well, the 60's were fun,
but now I'm paying for it.

1572
01:21:52,782 --> 01:21:54,241
Be careful up there!

1573
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:56,493
Hey, give me a break!
I haven't driven in two years!

1574
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:27,691
Oh, you got pezed!

1575
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:30,861
Up here!

1576
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:35,282
Oh, that's not good.

1577
01:22:38,703 --> 01:22:40,412
Hope!

1578
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:46,877
No!
- No!

1579
01:22:52,258 --> 01:22:53,384
There it is, right there.
Get the lab!

1580
01:22:53,551 --> 01:22:54,593
Get the lab!

1581
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:05,938
I've got her.
Westbound on Fremont.

1582
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:10,776
Hope! Wait!

1583
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:12,444
Hey, what about me?

1584
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:22,538
We got you now, Ava!

1585
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:25,249
Oh!

1586
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:50,315
Not again!

1587
01:23:51,985 --> 01:23:53,402
Piece of junk!

1588
01:23:56,781 --> 01:23:58,282
Ah! Yes!

1589
01:24:00,577 --> 01:24:02,244
Go, go, go, go, go!

1590
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:06,123
Burch got the lab.

1591
01:24:06,666 --> 01:24:08,417
I'm going after him.

1592
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:18,927
No, no, no,
no, no, no!

1593
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:23,640
Work in progress, my ass...

1594
01:24:39,115 --> 01:24:40,157
<i>Scott, where are you?</i>

1595

<i>I've got Burch in my sights.
Hurry!</i>

<i>We're running

<i>Warning,

I'm coming to you, honey.

1600
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:06,076
Guys.

1601
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:09,246
Don't you need the remote
to the lab? I just found it.

1602
01:26:09,455 --> 01:26:10,581
We can't grow
the lab without it.

1603
01:26:10,665 --> 01:26:11,832
Get it to us fast.

1604
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,083
Yeah, but the van is busted.

1605
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:14,668
Use the Hot Wheels Rally case.

1606
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:18,589
What?

1607
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:25,971
I love you, Dr. Pym.

1608
01:26:26,139 --> 01:26:27,347
The remote!
We're missing the remote!

1609
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:28,473
<i>You gotta check the van!</i>

1610
01:26:37,066 --> 01:26:38,025
Awesome!

1611
01:27:05,261 --> 01:27:06,178
Hey, I'm going down Pacific.

1612
01:27:06,346 --> 01:27:07,554
<i>Burch's boys are all over me.</i>

1613
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:08,805
I'm on my way.

1614
01:27:08,973 --> 01:27:11,016
Right. I'll get the lab.

1615
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:15,479
Hi.

1616
01:27:17,023 --> 01:27:18,148
Oh, that's badass!

1617
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:28,200
Nice.

1618
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:38,293
Doink!

1619
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:45,717
Come here, you little weasel!

1620
01:27:45,885 --> 01:27:47,594
No, you don't!

1621
01:27:50,556 --> 01:27:52,641
I guess maybe you do.

1622
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:54,893
Come on!

1623
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:09,366
Anyone see a Southern
gentleman carrying a building?

1624
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:15,998
How'd he even have time
to buy a ticket?

1625
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:19,126
Would you just one time,

1626
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:20,585
please work!

1627
01:28:21,671 --> 01:28:22,546
Yes!

1628
01:28:23,047 --> 01:28:24,172
All right, I need help.

1629
01:28:25,341 --> 01:28:26,425
Yes!

1630
01:28:27,343 --> 01:28:29,678
Oh. Sorry. Ah...

1631
01:28:30,638 --> 01:28:31,513
Somebody!

1632
01:28:31,681 --> 01:28:33,181
Hey! Come on, man!

1633
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:35,726
Not cool!

1634
01:28:35,893 --> 01:28:37,060
Murderers!

1635
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:40,731
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

1636
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:44,901
I'm gonna call you
Ant-onio Banderas!

1637
01:28:45,069 --> 01:28:46,403
You're a badass!

1638
01:28:46,863 --> 01:28:48,363
Yes!

1639
01:28:50,616 --> 01:28:51,867
No, no, no!

1640
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:53,618
Ant-onio!

1641
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:57,581
<i>Our friends, the humpbacks,</i>

1642
01:28:57,665 --> 01:28:59,541
<i>dip in here
to the San Francisco Bay...</i>

1643
01:28:59,709 --> 01:29:01,752
<i>for a little leisure
and a little breeding.</i>

1644
01:29:01,919 --> 01:29:03,128
Listen, Uzman...

1645
01:29:03,296 --> 01:29:05,422
<i>And perhaps they're down below
as we speak, doing the nasty.</i>

1646
01:29:05,673 --> 01:29:07,257
Just meet me
at the waterfront.

1647
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:08,467
In three hours.

1648
01:29:08,634 --> 01:29:09,801
<i>Oh, folks.
We've barely left the dock...</i>

1649
01:29:09,969 --> 01:29:11,762
<i>but it looks like
we got some company.</i>

1650
01:29:14,724 --> 01:29:15,891
<i>Look. Right there.
Do you see it, folks?</i>

1651
01:29:16,059 --> 01:29:18,226
<i>There it is.
There's a breach.</i>

1652
01:29:19,479 --> 01:29:20,771
What the...?

1653
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:28,612
Hi. Sorry. Hi.

1654
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:30,989
It's okay. It's okay!

1655
01:29:31,157 --> 01:29:33,742
Sorry, I know I'm not a whale.
This will just take a second.

1656
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:35,994
Hey! That doesn't belong
to you!

1657
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:37,621
No, no! No, no!

1658
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:38,747
You're embarrassing
yourself now.

1659
01:29:38,915 --> 01:29:41,833
Come on. Let go.

1660
01:29:41,918 --> 01:29:42,918
Thank you.

1661
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,130
I'll take this now.

1662
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:04,314
<i>It melts your mind.</i>

1663
01:30:06,192 --> 01:30:07,692
<i>A message in your head.</i>

1664
01:30:10,029 --> 01:30:11,196
<i>I had a dream.</i>

1665
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:13,031
<i>Daddy?
Where's Mommy?</i>

1666
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:14,616
<i>It's where I hid
every time that we played.</i>

1667
01:30:14,784 --> 01:30:15,826
<i>I love you, Hank.</i>

1668
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:33,635
Daddy?

1669
01:30:38,141 --> 01:30:39,433
Daddy?

1670
01:30:42,478 --> 01:30:45,272
Dad?
What's going on?

1671
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,606
Why haven't you found Mom?

1672
01:30:48,818 --> 01:30:51,528
You look lost, Hank.
Are you all right?

1673
01:30:53,614 --> 01:30:55,907
Still think you have
all the answers, Hank?

1674
01:31:51,797 --> 01:31:53,590
It's me.

1675
01:32:07,063 --> 01:32:09,022
I'm so sorry...

1676
01:32:11,317 --> 01:32:12,567
it took so long.

1677
01:32:12,735 --> 01:32:13,985
No.

1678
01:32:15,696 --> 01:32:16,780
No.

1679
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:19,032
You're here now.

1680
01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:21,785
Let's go home.

1681
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,497
I thought I was gone.

1682
01:32:26,290 --> 01:32:29,251
But that energy
from your hands...

1683
01:32:29,418 --> 01:32:30,835
how did you do that?

1684
01:32:33,673 --> 01:32:36,633
I'm not the same woman I was
30 years ago, Henry.

1685
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:38,260
This place...

1686
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:41,263
it changes you.

1687
01:32:43,057 --> 01:32:46,268
Adaptation is part of it,
but some of it is...

1688
01:32:46,435 --> 01:32:47,644
evolution.

1689
01:32:50,022 --> 01:32:52,190
<i>Lab coordinates not found.</i>

1690
01:32:52,525 --> 01:32:53,733
<i>Do not ascend.</i>

1691
01:32:54,819 --> 01:32:56,111
I should probably tell you

1692
01:32:56,195 --> 01:32:58,113
what we're dealing with
up there.

1693
01:32:59,949 --> 01:33:02,617
I got the lab. I got the lab.

1694
01:33:02,785 --> 01:33:05,078
Move.
Move.

1695
01:33:05,788 --> 01:33:07,706
Move!

1696
01:33:08,124 --> 01:33:10,041
Get out of the way.

1697
01:33:15,631 --> 01:33:16,798
Let's go.

1698
01:33:18,509 --> 01:33:22,095
<i>No one here appears
to be sure what this is.</i>

1699
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:25,098
<i>It's gotta be 80-85 feet tall.</i>

1700
01:33:30,021 --> 01:33:32,022
Get out of the way!

1701
01:33:32,982 --> 01:33:36,067
I got the lab.

1702
01:33:37,945 --> 01:33:39,154
The air feels chunky.

1703
01:33:39,322 --> 01:33:40,864
Oh, no. He's too big.

1704
01:33:44,827 --> 01:33:45,785
Scotty!

1705
01:33:45,953 --> 01:33:46,828
Scott!

1706
01:33:46,996 --> 01:33:48,830
I'm gonna go to sleep.

1707
01:33:48,998 --> 01:33:51,875
I'm just gonna go to sleep now
for five minutes.

1708
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:53,543
I just need five minutes.

1709
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:56,046
Five minutes!

1710
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:04,429
You get the lab
somewhere safe.

1711
01:34:04,597 --> 01:34:07,182
- Scott's air won't last.
- Okay.

1712
01:34:22,114 --> 01:34:22,947
Move!

1713
01:34:23,115 --> 01:34:25,909
Move! Move!

1714
01:34:27,870 --> 01:34:28,870
No, wait!

1715
01:34:40,299 --> 01:34:41,966
<i>Lab at full scale.</i>

1716
01:34:42,259 --> 01:34:43,218
They did it.

1717
01:34:43,386 --> 01:34:44,636
<i>Ready to ascend.</i>

1718
01:34:44,804 --> 01:34:46,429
Let's go see our daughter.

1719
01:35:08,869 --> 01:35:09,911
Scott!

1720
01:35:11,455 --> 01:35:12,789
Scott!

1721
01:35:12,957 --> 01:35:14,999
Scott, come on, wake up!

1722
01:35:29,181 --> 01:35:31,641
Come on.
Come on, where are you, Scott?

1723
01:35:33,602 --> 01:35:35,103
Gotcha.

1724
01:35:39,275 --> 01:35:40,442
Scott?

1725
01:35:46,824 --> 01:35:48,700
Hey.

1726
01:35:51,162 --> 01:35:53,621
Hey, Scotty!
Hope, come in.

1727
01:35:53,789 --> 01:35:55,623
Did you get crushed
by the building?

1728
01:35:58,919 --> 01:36:00,253
Where's the remote, Luis?

1729
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,547
It's probably in there.

1730
01:36:03,382 --> 01:36:04,674
I don't have it.
I don't have it.

1731
01:36:04,925 --> 01:36:06,634
I guess
this is where we say...

1732
01:36:07,303 --> 01:36:08,762
<i>Adiуs, amigo.</i>

1733
01:36:09,221 --> 01:36:10,847
No, no, no, no!

1734
01:36:14,018 --> 01:36:14,976
Thanks, guys.

1735
01:36:21,734 --> 01:36:22,734
Ava?

1736
01:36:23,402 --> 01:36:24,861
Ava!

1737
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:29,240
Ava!

1738
01:36:29,408 --> 01:36:30,742
Almost ready for extraction.

1739
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:33,161
Please, stop!
People are getting hurt!

1740
01:36:33,329 --> 01:36:35,830
Everything hurts.
Don't talk to me about pain!

1741
01:36:35,998 --> 01:36:37,582
What if Hank is right?

1742
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:39,417
What if this process
kills Janet?

1743
01:36:39,585 --> 01:36:40,835
What, you're worried
about her?

1744
01:36:41,003 --> 01:36:42,921
All I'm saying is that she is
a brilliant scientist.

1745
01:36:43,088 --> 01:36:44,297
She may be able to help.

1746
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:46,925
Oh, she will help. Right now!

1747
01:36:47,092 --> 01:36:48,927
And if she dies, she dies!

1748
01:36:49,094 --> 01:36:51,805
No, no. I'm sorry,
we can't do this.

1749
01:36:51,972 --> 01:36:53,973
We have to find another way.

1750
01:36:57,102 --> 01:36:59,103
This is the way.

1751
01:37:20,251 --> 01:37:21,501
Janet!

1752
01:37:32,304 --> 01:37:33,638
She started
the extraction.

1753
01:37:33,806 --> 01:37:35,807
She's gonna tear Mom apart.

1754
01:37:44,942 --> 01:37:45,942
No!

1755
01:38:20,269 --> 01:38:21,394
Hope!

1756
01:38:38,454 --> 01:38:39,537
Are you okay?

1757
01:38:54,428 --> 01:38:56,220
Mom?

1758
01:39:04,271 --> 01:39:05,772
Oh, my God.

1759
01:39:10,694 --> 01:39:12,278
We found you.

1760
01:39:16,116 --> 01:39:17,867
I missed you so much.

1761
01:39:18,535 --> 01:39:20,787
I missed you too, Jellybean.

1762
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:24,499
It's okay.

1763
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:27,669
I'm here now.
We have time.

1764
01:39:29,546 --> 01:39:31,714
No more last-minute
business trips, okay?

1765
01:39:32,216 --> 01:39:34,133
I promise.

1766
01:39:34,301 --> 01:39:35,301
No, it's okay!

1767
01:39:35,469 --> 01:39:37,220
It's all right.
Just don't worry about me.

1768
01:39:37,388 --> 01:39:39,138
- I'll be fine.
- Dad.

1769
01:39:44,311 --> 01:39:45,895
Scott.

1770
01:39:46,063 --> 01:39:47,730
Miss Van Dyne.

1771
01:39:49,316 --> 01:39:50,900
It's nice to...

1772
01:39:51,068 --> 01:39:52,527
Well, I guess
we've already met.

1773
01:39:52,695 --> 01:39:55,071
Yeah. I guess we have.

1774
01:39:58,283 --> 01:39:59,117
Wait.

1775
01:40:07,626 --> 01:40:09,002
Your pain.

1776
01:40:10,879 --> 01:40:12,213
I can feel it.

1777
01:40:14,758 --> 01:40:16,050
It hurts.

1778
01:40:18,178 --> 01:40:20,054
It always hurts.

1779
01:40:22,975 --> 01:40:24,475
I'm sorry.

1780
01:40:27,604 --> 01:40:29,689
I think I can help you.

1781
01:41:03,974 --> 01:41:05,933
Did you know
she could do that?

1782
01:41:09,188 --> 01:41:10,772
It's okay.

1783
01:41:13,275 --> 01:41:14,609
Guys, the cops are coming!

1784
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:20,865
The cops are coming.
Like, all of 'em!

1785
01:41:21,325 --> 01:41:23,159
- I gotta go.
- We gotta go!

1786
01:41:24,286 --> 01:41:25,536
What about them?

1787
01:41:28,373 --> 01:41:30,333
Hands in the air!

1788
01:41:30,501 --> 01:41:32,710
- No! We are going to our jobs.
- No.

1789
01:41:32,878 --> 01:41:34,921
You see, we see these guys.
They trying to shoot people.

1790
01:41:35,089 --> 01:41:38,299
So we apprehended them.
For you. You're welcome.

1791
01:41:38,467 --> 01:41:40,468
We traffic
in stolen technology.

1792
01:41:40,636 --> 01:41:42,512
And we have killed many,
many people.

1793
01:41:42,679 --> 01:41:44,138
He's in charge.

1794
01:41:44,306 --> 01:41:45,306
That's true, I am.

1795
01:41:46,141 --> 01:41:47,225
I've also committed

1796
01:41:47,309 --> 01:41:49,519
numerous health code
violations in my restaurant.

1797
01:41:49,686 --> 01:41:51,896
Some of them would shock you.

1798
01:41:54,817 --> 01:41:57,193
It is truth serum.

1799
01:42:01,198 --> 01:42:02,782
We gotta get outta here.

1800
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:04,534
Fast.

1801
01:42:05,702 --> 01:42:07,203
I have an idea.

1802
01:42:07,663 --> 01:42:08,955
<i>Giant figure, now spotted</i>

1803
01:42:09,039 --> 01:42:10,331
<i>at the intersection of
Broadway and Laguna.</i>

1804
01:42:10,499 --> 01:42:11,541
<i>All units move in.</i>

1805
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:13,084
Go, go!

1806
01:42:16,171 --> 01:42:17,588
There he is!

1807
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:24,262
It's over, Scotty!

1808
01:42:24,429 --> 01:42:26,556
I'm sorry,
but we got you, man!

1809
01:42:27,391 --> 01:42:29,225
Come on.
It's the end of the line, pal.

1810
01:42:29,393 --> 01:42:30,726
There's nowhere to hide.

1811
01:42:32,521 --> 01:42:35,648
Just pull off that Band-Aid!
You lost! It's okay!

1812
01:42:37,359 --> 01:42:39,819
Damn it, Scotty,
reduce yourself!

1813
01:42:45,951 --> 01:42:47,535
Magic.

1814
01:42:49,705 --> 01:42:50,705
Damn it!

1815
01:42:50,873 --> 01:42:52,623
Get to Lang's, now!

1816
01:42:59,089 --> 01:43:01,007
Well done, honey.

1817
01:43:01,091 --> 01:43:02,633
Let's go!

1818
01:43:10,767 --> 01:43:11,767
Leave me here.

1819
01:43:11,935 --> 01:43:13,019
We can make it.

1820
01:43:13,187 --> 01:43:14,270
You said it yourself.

1821
01:43:15,689 --> 01:43:17,690
I've hurt people.

1822
01:43:17,858 --> 01:43:19,525
But you haven't.

1823
01:43:19,693 --> 01:43:21,235
Go. Please!

1824
01:43:21,403 --> 01:43:22,695
We can make it, Ava.

1825
01:43:23,197 --> 01:43:24,614
Bill...

1826
01:43:25,282 --> 01:43:26,824
I'm not leaving you.

1827
01:44:10,619 --> 01:44:12,078
Oh, hey, guys.

1828
01:44:12,454 --> 01:44:14,372
Are my two years up already?

1829
01:44:21,171 --> 01:44:23,047
What's it like out there?

1830
01:44:23,215 --> 01:44:26,259
I mean, do people still dance?

1831
01:44:26,426 --> 01:44:28,511
Are food trucks still a thing?

1832
01:44:28,679 --> 01:44:30,471
Well, you got away with it
this time, Scott...

1833
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:33,849
but, I'll be seeing you again.

1834
01:44:34,268 --> 01:44:35,101
Where?

1835
01:44:37,104 --> 01:44:38,729
Where will you be
seeing me again?

1836
01:44:39,731 --> 01:44:43,025
Like, in general...

1837
01:44:43,193 --> 01:44:45,027
The next time
you do something bad,

1838
01:44:45,112 --> 01:44:46,570
- I'll be there to catch you...
- Oh.

1839
01:44:46,738 --> 01:44:48,656
You'll be watching...

1840
01:44:48,824 --> 01:44:51,242
I thought you were
inviting me somewhere.

1841
01:44:52,035 --> 01:44:53,619
Why would I do that?

1842
01:44:53,912 --> 01:44:56,289
That's what I was wondering,
why would you do that?

1843
01:44:56,456 --> 01:44:57,957
Like a party, or like,
dinner or something?

1844
01:44:58,125 --> 01:45:00,042
I don't know. I thought you
planned the evening.

1845
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:01,460
I meant, "I'll arrest you
later, again. "

1846
01:45:01,545 --> 01:45:02,753
Of course,
that would be strange.

1847
01:45:02,921 --> 01:45:04,714
- Take it easy, Jimmy.
- Okay.

1848
01:45:05,716 --> 01:45:07,174
Did you want to grab dinner,
or something?

1849
01:45:07,342 --> 01:45:09,510
I mean, because I'm free...

1850
01:45:09,678 --> 01:45:11,012
Yeah. Come on.

1851
01:45:20,522 --> 01:45:21,355
You ready?

1852
01:45:21,523 --> 01:45:22,523
Yeah!

1853
01:45:24,401 --> 01:45:26,193
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

1854
01:45:27,404 --> 01:45:28,612
Oh!

1855
01:45:29,364 --> 01:45:31,741
Yes, that was us.
How can I help you?

1856
01:45:32,409 --> 01:45:33,409
X- Con Security.

1857
01:45:34,953 --> 01:45:35,911
Mr. Karapetyan?

1858
01:45:36,747 --> 01:45:37,747
Yeah, you saw that?

1859
01:45:38,707 --> 01:45:42,710
It would be an honor to be
in business with you as well.

1860
01:45:42,878 --> 01:45:44,378
I'll see you Thursday,
9:00 AM. Okay.

1861
01:45:45,213 --> 01:45:46,213
Yeah!

1862
01:45:46,631 --> 01:45:49,258
That's how you close a deal!

1863
01:46:17,412 --> 01:46:19,121
This is awesome.

1864
01:46:19,915 --> 01:46:21,248
So, Cassie...

1865
01:46:21,416 --> 01:46:23,000
what do you want to be
when you grow up?

1866
01:46:23,418 --> 01:46:25,252
I wanna help people...

1867
01:46:25,420 --> 01:46:26,545
like my dad.

1868
01:46:27,547 --> 01:46:28,547
Really?

1869
01:46:29,925 --> 01:46:31,550
I wanted to be his partner.

1870
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,302
But he said he wants you.

1871
01:46:34,304 --> 01:46:35,513
Is that so?

1872
01:46:40,185 --> 01:46:41,560
Daddy!

1873
01:46:42,396 --> 01:46:44,063
Hold on.

1874
01:46:44,272 --> 01:46:46,148
Move, get outta here!

1875
01:46:46,358 --> 01:46:48,067
Scott, don't, don't, don't!

1876
01:46:50,654 --> 01:46:52,405
Oh, gross!

1877
01:46:52,531 --> 01:46:54,782
I hate that moth dust!

1878
01:46:55,158 --> 01:46:58,911
Go! Shoo! Shoo!

1879
01:49:06,039 --> 01:49:08,165
I used to be
a respected scientist.

1880
01:49:08,375 --> 01:49:11,293
I had my name
on the sides of buildings.

1881
01:49:11,795 --> 01:49:12,836
Now, I got this.

1882
01:49:13,588 --> 01:49:16,549
Well, you wanted
a smaller quantum tunnel.

1883
01:49:16,716 --> 01:49:19,301
This is... smaller.

1884
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:24,014
Oh. Sorry. My bad.

1885
01:49:24,140 --> 01:49:26,016
Ah, I think it has flair.

1886
01:49:27,561 --> 01:49:29,436
All right. Control's online.

1887
01:49:32,816 --> 01:49:34,942
The collection unit activates
when you decouple it.

1888
01:49:35,151 --> 01:49:36,944
It should automatically
start absorbing

1889
01:49:37,028 --> 01:49:38,320
quantum healing particles.

1890
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:41,448
Also, make sure you stay
out of the tardigrade fields.

1891
01:49:41,575 --> 01:49:42,950
They're cute,
but they'll eat you.

1892
01:49:43,076 --> 01:49:45,077
And don't get sucked
into a time vortex.

1893
01:49:45,161 --> 01:49:46,328
We won't be able to save you.

1894
01:49:49,416 --> 01:49:50,708
Okay.

1895
01:49:51,793 --> 01:49:53,168
Going subatomic in five...

1896
01:49:54,462 --> 01:49:55,462
four...

1897
01:49:56,047 --> 01:49:56,964
three...

1898
01:49:57,465 --> 01:49:58,465
two...

1899
01:49:58,717 --> 01:49:59,550
one.

1900
01:50:03,221 --> 01:50:05,806
All right, Scott,
this is a mic check.

1901
01:50:10,812 --> 01:50:12,813
Mic check, one, two.
One, two.

1902
01:50:12,981 --> 01:50:15,482
<i>How's everybody doing tonight
in the quantum realm?</i>

1903
01:50:15,734 --> 01:50:16,775
Scott, we read you.

1904
01:50:16,943 --> 01:50:18,527
I just wanna
make sure.

1905
01:50:24,117 --> 01:50:25,159
Okay.

1906
01:50:25,327 --> 01:50:28,078
Healing particles secured
for our new Ghost friend.

1907
01:50:28,246 --> 01:50:29,204
Great.

1908
01:50:29,372 --> 01:50:30,998
<i>Preparing for re-entry in...</i>

1909
01:50:31,124 --> 01:50:33,751
<i>five, four, three...</i>

1910
01:50:37,255 --> 01:50:38,631
Hello?

1911
01:50:39,758 --> 01:50:41,717
Ha, ha. Very funny.

1912
01:50:41,885 --> 01:50:43,218
Hank, quit screwing around.

1913
01:50:43,386 --> 01:50:45,763
You told me yourself
not to screw around.

1914
01:50:46,598 --> 01:50:47,598
<i>Hank?</i>

1915
01:50:49,142 --> 01:50:50,267
<i>Hope?</i>

1916
01:50:50,894 --> 01:50:51,894
<i>Janet.</i>

1917
01:50:53,104 --> 01:50:56,899
<i>Guys.</i>

1918
01:50:57,525 --> 01:50:58,984
<i>Okay, seriously,
don't joke around.</i>

1919
01:50:59,069 --> 01:51:00,277
<i>Bring me up, let's go.</i>

1920
01:51:00,737 --> 01:51:01,403
<i>Guys!</i>
