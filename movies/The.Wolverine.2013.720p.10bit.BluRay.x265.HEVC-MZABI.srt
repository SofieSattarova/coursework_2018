
1
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,880
Where are you going?

2
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,291
Help me!

3
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,039
Over here!

4
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,880
Go!

5
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,321
Go!

6
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,527
That was a B-29, bub. There's
no outrunning what's coming.

7
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,565
Yashida!

8
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,170
You're better off down here.

9
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,759
I'd hurry if I were you.

10
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,001
Run. Now!

11
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,964
Stay down!

12
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,807
No, wait! No, no. Wait.

13
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,326
No. It's not safe.

14
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,170
Wake up, wake up, wake up.
Wake up.

15
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,323
Where were you?

16
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,366
Nagasaki.

17
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,687
That far back?

18
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,681
You're here.

19
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,921
Of course.

20
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,889
Can you stay?

21
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,645
You know I can't.

22
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,802
Jean, I'm so sorry.

23
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,201
I know.

24
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,006
I'll never hurt you
or anyone ever again.

25
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,491
I made a vow.

26
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,044
A solemn vow?

27
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,402
You're making fun of me.

28
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,482
It's too late.

29
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,604
No! No, Jean!

30
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,205
No, no, no! Please!

31
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,446
You can't hide.

32
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,601
No, no, no! Please!

33
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,961
You can't hide!

34
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,645
No, Jean! No!

35
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,361
No.

36
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,563
Whack all of that on store credit.
Thanks, honey.

37
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,559
Got the arrows? Yeah.

38
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,286
Remember the arrows?

39
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,250
Yeah, yeah, Eddie, we got them!

40
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,799
Yeah!

41
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,566
Hey!

42
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,650
What are you doing?

43
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,370
Man, you almost
blew his foot off!

44
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,449
You're not a hunter, are you?

45
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,085
Not anymore.

46
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,448
What the hell?

47
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,930
Don't make me do this.

48
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,805
It must have been damn
near 12 feet tall.

49
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,442
We didn't hear nothing
except twigs.

50
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,211
Then it just came upon us.

51
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,370
It got Riley, just gutted him.
It got Eddie.

52
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,006
Ripped through the tent, knocked
over the snowcat like it was a toy.

53
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,928
You the one was attacked
by the grizzly?

54
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,761
I'm the one that survived.

55
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,565
I'd like to buy
this man a drink.

56
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,361
What's your name, mister?

57
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,130
It's Logan.

58
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,409
And that's a poison broadhead,
which, last I heard, was illegal.

59
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,650
Go ahead, ask me
where I found it.

60
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,564
Ask me.

61
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,320
Where did you find it?

62
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,482
Well, funny you should ask.

63
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,802
I pulled it out of the
back of a grizzly.

64
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,559
Whoever shot it, didn't
have the wind or the balls

65
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,005
to track the animal properly...

66
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,320
and put it out of its misery.

67
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,483
Instead of dropping a lethal
dose of the poison...

68
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,565
it bled into the bear, made him
crazy, killed five people.

69
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,410
I don't know what
you're talking about.

70
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,284
Because I don't dip my
arrows in anything.

71
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,527
In that case, you got
nothing to worry about.

72
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,601
Damn.

73
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,290
That hurt.

74
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,201
Sorry, Jean.

75
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,641
I wouldn't bother with them.

76
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,963
Most of them will die soon
anyway, without your help.

77
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,007
Three of them, a week from
now in the same truck.

78
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,642
This sword is hundreds
of years old...

79
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,202
and was named <i>Danzan</i> by the
first samurai who used it.

80
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,204
<i>Danzan</i> means "separator"
in Japanese.

81
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,447
The ideal weapon for separating
head and limb from body.

82
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,086
Whoa!

83
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,204
Like so.

84
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,601
I'm parked in back.

85
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,730
Get in.

86
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,721
Sorry, it's a rental.

87
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,651
Who are you?

88
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,485
Me? I'm Yukio.

89
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,085
And?

90
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,807
I've been trying to find
you for over a year.

91
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,481
Why?

92
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,682
To give you that.

93
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,129
My employer wanted
you to have it.

94
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,131
Who's your employer?

95
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,330
Master Yashida.

96
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,441
He said it belongs to you, and
that he's paying all debts.

97
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,122
Master Yashida is dying.

98
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,127
He wants to say thank you for saving
his life all those years ago.

99
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,729
He knows that you are a...

100
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,966
busy man.

101
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,647
But he very much wants to
say his goodbye in person.

102
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,724
All right, where is he?

103
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,120
Tokyo.

104
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,362
Wait... I'm not
going to Japan.

105
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,040
It would be dishonorable for
you to refuse his request.

106
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,330
Well, apologize to Mr. Yashida,
I'm not going to Tokyo.

107
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,005
All right? I've
got things to do.

108
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,566
Do not apologize.

109
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,246
It's been an honor just
to meet the Wolverine.

110
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,721
That's not who I am
anymore, you understand?

111
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,721
Interesting.

112
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,680
Why did you go into that
bar, if not to seek justice?

113
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,881
I don't know. You don't know.

114
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,240
No! I think you know.

115
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,402
Pull over. You are a soldier.

116
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,846
No, I'm not. Pull over.

117
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,119
You are a soldier.

118
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,849
Pull over, now!

119
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,320
Now.

120
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,765
You are a soldier, and you
seek what all soldiers do.

121
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,087
And what's that?

122
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,762
An honorable death.

123
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,126
An end to your pain.

124
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,449
Who says I'm in pain?

125
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,770
A man who has nightmares every
night of his life is in pain.

126
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,680
One day.

127
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,848
I say goodbye to Mr. Yashida
and I come right back.

128
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,650
Okay.

129
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,609
Fifteen hours.
Depending on the wind.

130
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,850
Fifteen hours?

131
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,360
You don't like to fly?

132
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,445
I love it.

133
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,286
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

134
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,566
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

135
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,481
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

136
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,559
<i>Kuzuri.</i> What does that mean?

137
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,925
Monster.

138
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,367
No pain?

139
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,090
You have no... Oh, yeah. Pain.

140
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,485
Plenty of pain.

141
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,569
How old are you?

142
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,363
It's been a long time.

143
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,091
Many wars.

144
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,291
Understand?

145
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,769
Too many fuckin' wars.

146
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,965
We are almost there.

147
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,885
So, you can see the future?

148
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,968
I can read a map.

149
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,689
You said you knew the future
of those assholes in the bar.

150
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,522
I know they are going to die.

151
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,522
We are all going to die.

152
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,208
You said they would die in
the same truck, in a week.

153
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,882
If you're right,
that's quite a talent.

154
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,209
We don't all have claws.

155
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,211
So, do I die on this plane?

156
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,881
No.

157
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,371
Not on this plane.

158
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,929
Don't let the lights fool you.

159
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,124
These are dark days in Japan.

160
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,599
Some believe when Master
Yashida got sick,

161
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,761
a shadow fell upon us.

162
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,924
Do you think he's a God?

163
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,403
No. A man.

164
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,165
But a great one.

165
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,450
After the war, he helped
rebuild the nation.

166
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,206
And the family business
became Japan's largest.

167
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,483
Wow. Did they give you a
little card to memorize?

168
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,442
I owe Master Yashida my life.

169
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,525
Don't be a dick.

170
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,159
A lot of guns.

171
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,685
There have been attacks.

172
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,565
Attempted kidnappings.
Attempted assassinations.

173
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,051
BY Who?

174
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,731
The Japanese mob, the Yakuza.

175
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,679
They've grown strong as the
government has grown weak.

176
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,845
Hip replacement.

177
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,771
Uh, too small.

178
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,805
Too small.

179
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,686
Hey.

180
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,121
This way.

181
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,531
Who's that?

182
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,607
Shingen, Master Yashida's son.

183
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,241
He's good.

184
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,761
He's all right.

185
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,445
So, what happened to
the badass in boots?

186
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,762
Master Yashida is traditional.

187
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,890
One eye on the past and
the other on the future.

188
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,922
That's Mariko, his
granddaughter.

189
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,326
Mariko.

190
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,410
What's wrong with you?

191
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,041
You haven't answered my emails.

192
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,285
I can't tell you now.

193
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,044
Yes, you can.

194
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,523
Who is the caveman?

195
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,811
The man Grandfather
wanted me to find.

196
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,167
You can't bring
him in like that.

197
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,770
Shizu and Saki are going
to disinfect you.

198
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,681
Give you a shave.

199
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,370
Like hell they are.

200
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,365
Get in the tub.

201
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,001
Whoa.

202
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,242
Get in the tub.

203
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,326
Really?

204
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,326
All right.

205
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,766
Okay. Okay.

206
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,321
All right, all right, all right.
I can do that bit.

207
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,440
What?

208
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,726
What?

209
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,885
You look nice.

210
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,528
I feel violated.

211
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,324
Prepare two more suppressors
for Master Yashida.

212
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,404
And check his blood pressure.

213
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,650
Yashida<i>-sama.</i>

214
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,766
Oh...

215
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,207
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

216
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,643
You look the same.

217
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,164
But, then, that is no surprise.

218
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,964
Dr. Green.

219
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,642
Leave us, please.

220
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,169
Five minutes, no more.

221
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,165
My oncologist.

222
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,001
Well done.

223
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,765
Oh, forget the etiquette.
I'm past such precautions.

224
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,362
For many years I have wanted to
thank you for saving my life.

225
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,841
Yeah, well...

226
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,730
You were kind to me.

227
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,609
And you were kind
to many people.

228
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,169
I saw that even from that well.

229
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,328
The painting is from the
village of my birth.

230
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:49,130
It depicts the bravery and
skill of the Black Clan.

231
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,766
Ninja warriors.

232
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,969
They served my family
for seven centuries.

233
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,321
I didn't send for you
only to thank you, Logan.

234
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,929
I wanted to repay you.

235
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,650
To offer you something
no one else can.

236
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,968
A gift to equal the
life you gave to me.

237
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,850
I don't need anything.

238
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,445
Nota thing.

239
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,845
Eternity can be a curse.

240
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,725
It hasn't been easy for
you, living without time.

241
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,642
The losses you have
had to suffer.

242
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,044
A man can run out of
things to live for.

243
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,490
Lose his purpose.

244
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,369
Become a ronin.

245
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,849
A samurai without a master.

246
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,006
I can end your eternity.

247
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,086
Make you mortal.

248
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:57,046
What they did to me, what
I am, can't be undone.

249
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,170
Yashida Industries
can do anything.

250
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,323
We have reason to believe your
ability to heal can be passed.

251
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,527
Passed?

252
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,205
From you to another.

253
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,849
You have struggled
long enough, Logan.

254
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,441
I'm confused.

255
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,241
I came here to say goodbye
to a man I once knew.

256
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,129
I am the same man.

257
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,760
I was not ready to die then.

258
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,446
I am not ready to die now.

259
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,446
But you are...

260
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,444
aren't you?

261
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,682
Are you offering to kill me?
No.

262
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,763
Not right away.

263
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,569
You can live a long
and ordinary life.

264
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,883
Fall in love, have a family...
grow old.

266
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,209
And one day, die
an ordinary death.

267
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,050
It can be done.

268
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,604
Yeah, look, nice to see you again.
Sorry you got sick.

269
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,809
Please, Logan-<i>San.
</i> I need you again.

270
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,406
I fear for my family.

271
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,086
I fear for everything
I have built.

272
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,402
Enough. You should leave.
Please, Logan<i>-San.</i>

273
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,005
They're going to kill her.

274
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,843
Who?

275
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,288
Mariko, my granddaughter.

276
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,281
She is my treasure. She
must be protected.

277
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,319
You don't want what I've got.

278
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,241
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

279
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,846
<i>Kuzuri!</i>

280
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,930
Lord Shingen, your father
is asking for you.

281
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,923
It is time.

282
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,649
I need to speak
with my father...

283
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,169
before he speaks to Grandfather.

284
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,323
He'll talk to you later, Mariko.

285
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,010
Father! I need to see you now!

286
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,964
Not now, Mariko!

287
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,002
Careful, careful. It's
slippery out here.

288
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,361
Let go.

289
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,284
You about done?

290
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,688
Let go of me.

291
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,291
He just wanted to
say goodbye, huh?

292
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,405
You two grew up together.

293
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,201
Yes.

294
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,569
But you're not her sister.

295
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,046
No.

296
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,571
Master Yashida found me
on a trip to the South.

297
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,444
He brought Mariko to see a
factory he was building.

298
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:05,008
I was digging through the
garbage for something to eat.

299
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,610
So they just took
you home with them?

300
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,322
It was always difficult for
Mariko to make friends.

301
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,121
I'll see to it the plane
is ready in the morning.

302
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,523
Sleep here.

303
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,244
Don't look so sad, Shingen.

304
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,169
I'm still dying.

305
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,206
I'll be in my office
if you need me.

306
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,167
There is no easy
way to say this.

307
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,964
But then, it's never been
easy for us, has it?

308
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,288
I have tried, father.

309
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,841
You've done the best you can.

310
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,886
You have always been
my assumed successor.

311
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,279
So the past few
years, as a test,

312
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,248
I allowed you more control.

313
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,879
It has been an honor.

314
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,089
And I now realize
that was a mistake.

315
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,767
You have brought this
company close to ruin.

316
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:52,724
When I die, someone else will
take my place as chairman.

317
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,239
Father, I'm sorry if I
have disappointed you...

318
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,242
Let's not insult one another.

319
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,683
You are not the man
to lead Yashida.

320
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,484
You cannot bring in
someone from the outside.

321
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,807
In that, you are correct.

322
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,005
That will never happen.

323
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,890
<i>Eternity can be a curse...</i>

324
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,040
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

325
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,602
<i>You have no pain, Kuzuri?</i>

326
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,801
How old are you?

327
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,930
Interesting offer.

328
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,451
What are you doing turning
the old man down?

329
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,646
I thought you wanted
to be with me.

330
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,087
Come here.

331
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,881
He's dead.

332
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,282
I didn't foresee it.

333
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,726
Who's that? With Mariko.

334
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,370
His name is Noburo Mori.

335
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,131
Minister of Justice,
a rising star.

336
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,886
He's Mariko's fiancé.

337
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,042
You need to bow.

338
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,559
Bow.

339
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,089
Lord Shingen, this
is Mr. Logan.

340
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,083
I know who he is.

341
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,439
Your father was a good man.

342
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,207
He would often say
the same about you.

343
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,087
But then, he was always
fascinated with your kind.

344
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:34,329
Tell me, why do you think he sent
our little Yukio to fetch you?

345
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,765
To say goodbye.

346
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,602
And now you have.

347
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,840
Time for you to go
back to your cave.

348
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,967
Anyone else you
want me to meet?

349
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,323
I Pledge to you...

350
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,405
Master Yashida...

351
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,563
to be vigilant...

352
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,683
and to dedicate my life...

353
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,888
to protect Mariko.

354
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,087
That armor belonged
to <i>Shiruba-Samurai...</i>

355
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,527
the Silver Samurai.

356
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,127
It will stand watch over
the old man forever.

357
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,485
Logan?

358
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,089
Hey. Something's not right.

359
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,399
Let go.

360
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,527
Logan!

361
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,804
Logan!

362
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,321
Logan!

363
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,961
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

364
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,570
Let's go. Come on, let's go!

365
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,039
Yukio! Mariko!

366
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,005
Mariko!

367
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,370
Come on. Let's go, let's go.

368
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,844
Here, here! Here!

369
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,241
Move!

370
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,208
In here! Move!

371
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,485
Keep moving, keep moving.

372
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,770
Move!

373
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,444
You're bleeding.
You need help.

374
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,125
Just keep moving.

375
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,123
Thank you for what
you did back there.

376
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,884
Those were Yakuza. I'm fine.

377
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,724
Why are they after you?

378
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,406
I'm fine. I can make
my way from here.

379
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:55,207
You should go. Get
yourself a doctor.

380
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,879
Whoa!

381
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,001
That's nice.

382
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,568
This is one of those
bullet trains, right?

383
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,563
I told you I don't
need your help.

384
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,963
So what do they do, like,
300 miles an hour?

385
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,929
This cowardly attack was...

386
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,049
the work of Yakuza thugs.

387
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:16,365
A violent response
to my efforts...

388
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,729
to crack down on
organized crime.

389
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,731
They exited the North Gate.

390
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,770
She was with the stranger...

391
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,887
Your <i>gaijin</i> friend,
where is he?

392
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,562
Last I saw, he was
protecting your daughter.

393
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,649
You are a toy doll.

394
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,963
A companion for a child
who has outgrown you.

395
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,327
Keep that in mind.

396
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,841
So, where are we
headed, Mariko?

397
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,521
Where are we going?

398
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,559
I'm going to the
end of the line.

399
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,881
My family has a
home in the South.

400
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,680
That's stupid.

401
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,284
No offense, but they're gonna
know to look for you there.

402
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,443
Not this place.

403
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,771
You want to be left alone. Yes.

404
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,119
I understand. Do you?

405
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,610
Oh, yeah. Trust me.

406
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,881
Problem is, if I do that...

407
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,321
I don't think you're gonna live
to see the end of the day.

408
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:39,441
You can't pretend shit isn't
happening when it is, princess.

409
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:43,361
Unless you want to die. In that case,
you're playing this perfectly.

410
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,164
Oh... What the hell?

411
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,406
Oh...

412
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,684
What the hell is happening?

413
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,121
What happened to you?

414
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,924
We get off here. Let's go.

415
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,807
Just listen to me, will you? We
need to find someplace safe.

416
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,770
I don't understand. How do
you know they were Yakuza?

417
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,481
They were the same
guys from the temple.

418
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,881
How do you know
they were after me?

419
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,239
Look, we need to
find someplace safe.

420
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,287
We need to get off the streets.

421
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,329
I don't understand.
Shut up! Listen.

422
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,926
Do you know this place?
Where's downtown?

423
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,605
Straight ahead.

424
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,122
So, where's the
nice part of town?

425
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,611
Another eight blocks that way.

426
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,808
Good. We're staying here.

427
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,810
Let's go.

428
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,808
This is a love hotel.

429
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,325
A what?

430
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,005
A love hotel.

431
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,011
For couples, understand?

432
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,489
Uh... Right.

433
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,486
Hey.

434
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,850
Uh, two rooms. Adjoining
rooms, on the same floor.

435
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,327
Right next to each other.
Very close.

436
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,889
Same floor. Same floor.

437
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,121
What did she say?

438
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,209
She has no rooms available
next to each other.

439
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:55,241
She's asking if we prefer "the
dungeon", "the nurse's office..."

440
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,691
or the "mission to Mars."

441
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,205
This'll do.

442
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,447
<i>Liftoff! We have a liftoff!</i>

443
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,762
Kind of homey, actually.

444
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,770
Where do you plan on sleeping?

445
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,322
I don't.

446
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,245
That's a lot of blood.

447
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,804
I thought you were
done being the hero.

448
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,444
But these guys were...
trying to kill her.

449
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,248
Just let it go.

450
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,370
It's not hard to die.

451
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,003
Come to me.

452
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,161
Eh!

453
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,647
Oh.

454
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,281
Logan...

455
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,319
You're slipping.

456
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,641
Logan...

457
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,560
Kill him already!

458
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,690
Wanna say something
before you die, <i>gaijin?</i>

459
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,562
This is Mieko from the hotel
and her grandson, Hitoshi.

460
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,324
Is he a doctor?

461
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,161
In a manner of speaking, yes.

462
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,727
He's a veterinarian...

463
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,484
student.

464
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,730
Large animal.

465
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,439
Uh... Thanks.

466
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,124
Whoa.

467
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:38,410
You may have cut him once or twice
while he was stitching you.

468
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,564
Okay, okay, okay.

469
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,521
Hey.

470
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,404
Thank you.

471
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:02,801
I never needed this before.

472
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,281
What? Help?

473
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:14,080
That doctor, the one who helped
your grandfather, the blonde.

474
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,287
Who is she?

475
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,967
He met her last year when he
was in America for treatment.

476
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,999
Your grandfather told me my
healing could be taken from me,

477
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,081
passed on.

478
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,360
I'm not getting better,
not like before.

479
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,490
She did this to me.

480
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:43,879
Blondie!

481
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,041
Blondie!

482
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,849
How much? How much, yeah?
How much?

483
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:17,399
You kept me waiting two hours.
You have no respect.

484
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,050
So you haven't found them?

485
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,241
Don't play with me, bitch.
I could kill you.

486
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:29,246
If you could make me feel something,
Harada, that would be sublime.

487
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,239
I can slit your
pretty mouth open,

488
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,322
before you open it to
say one more stupid...

489
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,286
Ah...

490
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,570
I asked you to do one
thing, little man.

491
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,524
Bring me the mutant.

492
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,639
I don't work for you. I
work for the House of...

493
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:50,605
You work for Yashida, I get it.

494
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,529
Yet you cannot fulfill
his dying wish.

495
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:59,568
My God, if you had any idea
how much you have failed him.

496
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:03,042
Where is Logan? I am
not done with him.

497
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,879
The mutant has powers.

498
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:16,040
He's just a man now.
His flesh is weak now.

499
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:17,925
I did that.

500
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,731
I suppressed his power
so he could be taken.

501
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,123
You see, it's me you
should respect.

502
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:31,201
Just find them,
before the Yakuza.

503
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,888
We get off here.

504
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,809
Where are we?

505
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,529
Just outside Nagasaki.

506
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,091
This way.

507
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,607
This is the guy from the
funeral, the archer.

508
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,923
He was your boyfriend.

509
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,162
That's Harada.

510
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,323
We were village
champions that summer.

511
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:09,405
He with the bow and
me with the knives.

512
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,646
Harada and I were
planning to get married.

513
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,370
What stopped you?

514
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:20,846
Grandfather.

515
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,685
He said we had to wait
until we were at least 15.

516
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:34,204
From the Mountain,
from the sea.

517
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,044
Chopsticks upright
are a bad omen.

518
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,048
It resembles incense
at a funeral.

519
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:58,046
Nothing is without meaning.

520
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,199
So, the other night
at the house,

521
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,601
when you ran out in the rain...

522
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,922
what did that mean?

523
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,688
My grandfather was dying.

524
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,399
You knew he was gonna die.

525
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,679
He'd been sick for a long time.

526
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,206
It wasn't his death I feared.

527
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,603
So, what, then?

528
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,769
What did he tell
you that night?

529
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,681
Mariko, why did your
father hit you?

530
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,285
I was trying to warn him.

531
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,090
About what?

532
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:36,927
What did your
grandfather tell you?

533
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:42,249
He told me that...

534
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:48,801
in three days, when
they read his will...

535
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:55,444
I will become the most
powerful person in Japan.

536
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,084
He gave it all to me.

537
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:02,881
The company?

538
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,122
I didn't want it.

539
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,288
He knew that.

540
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,245
I don't understand why
he gave it to me.

541
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,001
It was all my
father dreamed of.

542
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,009
Well, that's why.

543
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:29,641
What about this fiancé of yours?
Nostromo.

544
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:31,806
Noburo.

545
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,644
Does he know about this?

546
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,131
No.

547
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,329
Why are you marrying him?

548
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,762
He seems like kind
of an asshole.

549
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:45,007
My father arranged
it last year.

550
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:46,481
What?

551
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,883
It gives him a better access
to the political theater.

552
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:56,608
To disobey my father would
be to dishonor him.

553
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,926
I don't expect you
to understand.

554
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,961
You're not Japanese.

555
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:19,206
Our island is long and thin.

556
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,842
Trains only run in
two directions.

557
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:23,851
I assure you Lord Shingen...

558
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:25,883
my officers are making
every effort...

559
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:28,003
Then they're idiots.

560
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:30,088
You've wasted
enough of my time.

561
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,048
I have my father's
affairs to attend to.

562
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,085
Get out and find her!

563
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,043
Tell me you have more promising
news from your contacts.

564
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,808
They open the will
in three days.

565
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:51,044
We are running out of time.

566
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,562
Soon, I hope.

567
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,889
I'm sending men to the South.

568
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:59,042
That's where we
found the bodies.

569
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,889
If the Yakuza got
into the funeral...

570
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,491
they had someone inside.

571
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:16,161
They'll never find me here.

572
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,005
You're not safe.

573
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,925
I'm coming down there.

574
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,526
They'll follow you.

575
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,080
Please.

576
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:27,766
Wait a few days.

577
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,286
Please. I'm fine.

578
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,171
Logan's here.

579
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,442
He's wounded, Mariko.

580
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,399
Someone's here.

581
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,159
Mariko?

582
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:37,968
I have to go.

583
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,401
Mariko?

584
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:45,411
A tree fell on the road.

585
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,604
The men could use some help.

586
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,530
Are you okay?

587
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:27,287
Tired.

588
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,524
Do you need something?

589
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:32,721
No.

590
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:42,966
This will help.

591
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,250
It's time.

592
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:40,121
What?

593
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:43,891
Please. Take it.

594
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,925
Thank you.

595
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,611
No.

596
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,810
Two hands.

597
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:14,080
Japanese sword
require two hands.

598
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,042
Like that? That's it.

599
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,648
It's beautiful, Yashida.

600
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,766
But I can't take it.

601
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:31,566
Please.

602
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:33,926
Thank you.

603
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:41,521
Keep it safe.

604
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,329
Keep it safe for me.

605
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:51,491
Someday, I'll come get it.

606
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:01,003
It's time.

607
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:51,361
I was here when it happened.

608
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:56,241
It's how I met
your grandfather.

609
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,682
We hid in there.

610
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:01,725
I heard the stories.

611
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,050
My grandfather would say...

612
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:11,363
what happened here was proof that
everything in the world finds peace.

613
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,082
Eventually.

614
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,886
That man can recover
from anything.

615
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:31,486
Maybe you, too.

616
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,562
You don't sleep very well.

617
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,722
You call out in the night.

618
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:49,606
Who's Jean?

619
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:07,371
We should go back.
There's rain coming.

620
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:29,645
I'll make tea.

621
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,131
For you.

622
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,570
This isn't right.

623
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:33,488
You need this tied
like a proper samurai.

624
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:39,642
Your grandfather
called me a ronin.

625
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:43,401
A samurai without a master.

626
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,443
He said I was destined
to live forever...

627
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:52,006
with no reason to live.

628
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,485
Was he right?

629
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,091
Yes.

630
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,969
Still?

631
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:58,161
Hey.

632
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,730
What are you doing?

633
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:07,800
This isn't going to end well.

634
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,202
Everyone you love dies.

635
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,882
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

636
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,684
Do you know what that means?

637
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,203
An animal.

638
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:52,605
A fierce creature with long
claws and sharp teeth.

639
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,728
It fears nothing.

640
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:02,570
When I was a girl,
I had nightmares.

641
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:05,641
I'd wake up and run
to my parents.

642
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:09,285
My father would get angry.

643
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:16,803
"Go back to sleep.
Face your fears."

644
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:20,766
My grandfather was different.

645
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:25,486
He told me stories about
<i>Kuzuri,</i> his friend.

646
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:29,449
Who he met at the
bottom of a well.

647
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:36,088
He said the <i>Kuzuri</i> was
magical and saved his life.

648
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:43,770
He said <i>Kuzuri</i> would protect
me, too, as I slept in my bed.

649
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,530
Who's Jean?

650
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:03,685
Is she like you?

651
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,442
What happened to her?

652
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,649
She died.

653
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,124
I killed her.

654
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,723
Along with the Kuzuri.

655
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,400
Logan.

656
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,683
Mariko?

657
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,002
Logan!

658
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:33,211
Logan!

659
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:35,841
Mariko?

660
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:37,726
Mariko!

661
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,443
No! Logan!

662
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,361
No!

663
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:49,282
Logan!

664
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:50,967
No!

665
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:03,802
Mariko!

666
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:08,601
Logan!

667
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,401
No!

668
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:14,721
Logan!

669
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,564
Mariko! Mariko!

670
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:19,245
Logan!

671
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,920
Where are they taking her?

672
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:42,804
Where are they taking her?

673
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,450
Where, you piece of shit?

674
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:48,931
I no talk, <i>gaijin.</i>

675
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,489
I never talk.

676
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,127
Who hired you?

677
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,009
Uh-oh.

678
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,964
Take me to Noburo.

679
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,643
Logan... Take me to him.

680
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:29,800
I need to tell you something.

681
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,883
Do it. Now.

682
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:53,083
You wait in the car.

683
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:55,562
Logan. What?

684
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,323
I saw you die.

685
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,005
What?

686
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,244
I saw you die.

687
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:04,682
When? Just now?

688
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,849
Awhile ago.

689
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,890
But it's not like I get
a complete picture.

690
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:12,327
More like looking
through a keyhole.

691
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:16,121
But I'm always right.

692
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,368
All I can see is one part
of a person's life...

693
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,530
their death.

694
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:25,481
And I saw yours.

695
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:30,563
So, what did you see?

696
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:35,364
I see you on your back.
There's blood everywhere.

697
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:40,409
You're holding your own
heart in your hand.

698
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,528
It's not beating.

699
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:46,560
I don't have time
for this shit.

700
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:50,766
When I was five, I knew how
my own parents would die.

701
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:56,607
Then I watched it happen
from the back seat.

702
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:00,721
Look at me.

703
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,571
A lot of people have tried to
kill me, and I'm still here.

704
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:08,690
Yeah...

705
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:11,366
but you're different
now, aren't you?

706
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:14,043
They can hurt you.

707
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:16,202
They can kill you.

708
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:18,362
Just wait in the car.

709
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,202
I said, wait in the car.
You need backup.

710
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:33,243
You're not safe, not
in your condition.

711
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,601
Just think of me
as your bodyguard.

712
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:48,409
Sexy.

713
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,408
- Come on!
- I'm coming.

714
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:08,929
Okay, round four. Here we go.

715
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:23,485
Drink for you, my lady.

716
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:32,561
Get out.

717
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:39,924
Not you.

718
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,001
Call me old-fashioned...

719
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:44,799
but I thought being
engaged meant

720
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,006
you were done with
this kind of bullshit.

721
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:47,639
I am the Minister of Justice.

722
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:48,926
Do you have any idea
what I could do to you?

723
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:51,039
Really? You're gonna
try and talk tough,

724
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:52,849
standing there in
your red underwear?

725
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:56,967
You have ten words...
ten words...

727
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:01,483
to explain to me why you,
the Minister of Justice...

728
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:04,484
would want your fiancé
killed by the Yakuza.

729
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,239
And if I don't
like what you say,

730
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:08,846
you are going through
that fucking window.

731
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:11,879
You don't have the faintest
idea what's going on...

732
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:16,568
How many words was that? Nine.

733
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:19,371
Nine. You have one word left.

734
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:23,043
Really?

735
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:24,810
Really?

736
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,645
Shingen. Shingen!

737
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:29,801
Keep going.

738
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,291
Since he got sick...

739
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:36,962
old man Yashida spent
billions on doctors, healers.

740
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:39,885
Stockpiling adamantium at
his lab in the North...

741
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:42,441
secretly trying to
prolong his life.

742
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:45,729
He brought the company to
the edge of bankruptcy.

743
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:48,042
He was obsessed with you.

744
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:51,926
English!

745
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:55,484
Shingen lied, protected
the old man...

746
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:58,849
concealed the debt from
stockholders and the board.

747
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,401
He tried to be a good son and
thought he'd be rewarded.

748
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,799
And then the old man left
everything to his granddaughter.

749
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,326
If Mariko got all that power,
she would dump his ass.

750
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:08,447
It's true.

751
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:11,689
Mariko would have never gone
through with the wedding...

752
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:14,320
not once the will was revealed.

753
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,246
She never took to me.

754
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:19,524
Oh, really? A class
act like you.

755
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:22,845
Shingen promised me a
fortune for my help.

756
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,607
So, you put a hit on his daughter.
Is that it?

757
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:30,682
Political careers
don't last forever.

758
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:32,367
That's right.

759
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:34,523
Wait! Wait! No!

760
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:37,445
You wanted the truth.
I told you the truth!

761
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,169
I didn't like it.

762
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:42,171
Wow.

763
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:45,451
How did you know there's
a pool down there?

764
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,011
I didn't.

765
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:07,689
Did you know I studied
biology in college?

766
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:11,005
Genetics.

767
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:17,486
There are genes that
skip generations.

768
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,764
Recessive genes.

769
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:23,359
Eyes.

770
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:24,486
Eyes. Hair.

771
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,166
Talent.

772
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:30,050
Temperament.

773
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:35,408
Not every child gets the same.

774
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:38,322
My father saw little
of himself in me.

775
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:41,005
But in you...

776
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,767
he faced a mirror.

777
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,850
How did you convince
my father...

778
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,490
to award you control...

779
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,125
of Asia's largest corporation?

780
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:10,045
You've gone insane.

781
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,329
I'm just waking up.

782
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:16,650
If you kill me,
you will lose...

783
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,769
what little honor
you have left.

784
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:23,681
Fear not Mariko.

785
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:26,327
I don't want to hurt you.

786
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:27,806
I want to help you.

787
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,690
Help you end your pain...

788
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:31,160
what that mutant stopped you...

789
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:32,646
from doing last week.

790
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:35,081
I never wanted to die, Father.

791
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:53,959
It's alright, Mariko.

792
01:28:59,080 --> 01:28:59,842
Come with me.

793
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:00,847
What is happening?!

794
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:03,327
More than you can imagine.

795
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,284
You.

796
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:15,170
Me.

797
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:19,041
Sorry to interrupt, but I
need your daughter alive.

798
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:20,531
What are you?

799
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:23,761
A Chemist, a nihilist...

800
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:27,647
a capitalist, a mutation.

801
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:32,765
A viper.

802
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,809
Where is the security?

803
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:25,841
Yakuza.

804
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:29,481
Shingen?

805
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:51,366
Logan.

806
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,570
This. This here.

807
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:05,324
Where is this?

808
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,568
Master Yashida's birthplace.

809
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:14,410
The company built a facility
into the mountainside.

810
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:19,406
How far?

811
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:22,646
500 kilometers from here.

812
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:31,881
I gotta get that
thing out of me.

813
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:33,322
How?

814
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:34,881
No, stop, Logan.

815
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:38,044
I saw you die.
I'm never wrong.

816
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:40,248
I'm never wrong. You're
not always right.

817
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:41,606
You didn't know the old
man was gonna bite it.

818
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,683
I saw you die in a room like this
with your heart in your hand.

819
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,729
I can't leave her with
those freaks and killers.

820
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,288
I'm the only chance she's got, but
not with that thing inside me.

821
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:50,599
You're going to die, Logan.

822
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:52,125
Maybe that's okay.

823
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:54,403
No, listen to me, Logan!

824
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:56,562
No, stop. Logan!

825
01:32:57,680 --> 01:32:59,091
You're not gonna want
to watch this part.

826
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,766
No! Listen to me! Please, no!

827
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,971
No, stop. Listen to me.

828
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:07,247
Logan!

829
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:17,087
Move!

830
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:18,839
Stay away from him.

831
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:21,929
He killed your master.

832
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:25,331
Put hands on your sister.

833
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,519
And now you want him?

834
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:32,043
Oh, no. I can't see.

835
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:34,849
You'll always be a beggar.

836
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:35,962
You're crazy.

837
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:45,327
Oh, no.

838
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:17,806
Yukio.

839
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:38,401
Logan!

840
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:47,682
Logan! Logan!

841
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:49,686
Logan!

842
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,048
Don't hit my friends.

843
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:38,201
Where's Mariko?

844
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:41,204
She's gone. That Viper
bitch took her.

845
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:43,681
It was my father's obsession...

846
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:47,210
with mutation, with
God's mistakes...

847
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:52,884
like you and her, that
ruined this house.

848
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:07,530
You tried to kill
your daughter.

849
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:11,645
Live with that.

850
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:29,650
What kind of monster are you?

851
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:32,090
The Wolverine.

852
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:48,449
Hey, come here, come here.
That's it.

853
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:50,121
I was wrong.

854
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:52,171
I told you.

855
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:54,084
Let me have a look at you.

856
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:56,405
It's nothing.

857
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:59,245
Hey, thank you.

858
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:13,767
It's a trap, Logan.

859
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:35,084
Why have you brought me here?

860
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:36,965
What are you hiding?

861
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:38,850
You will soon find out.

862
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:43,088
Welcome, Mariko.

863
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:47,449
It's all right, Mariko. She also
serves the House of Yashida.

864
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:49,011
She serves herself.

865
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:51,447
She infected Logan.

866
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:54,321
Hmm... And what
about Grandfather?

868
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:56,930
What did you infect him with?

869
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:02,127
I granted his dying wish.

870
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:04,842
I helped him rest.

871
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:09,281
Now, it's your turn.

872
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:45,885
Listen to me, mutant.
She will not be harmed.

873
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:48,964
She will be fine.

874
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:52,242
So long as you do your job.

875
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:56,090
Logan will be here soon,
you should prepare.

876
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:58,887
It was easy to lure him here.

877
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:00,799
It's another thing
to capture him.

878
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:03,883
We're ready. He's never
faced the Black Clan.

879
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:07,806
Yes, well...

880
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:11,962
Dip your arrows in this.

881
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:14,409
It won't kill him,

882
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:17,039
but it will slow him down.

883
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:18,166
Keep your potions.

884
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:20,921
He's no challenge for us now.
He's weak.

885
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:22,881
Okay.

886
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:27,929
But when you fail...

887
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:30,811
you have this.

888
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:50,283
Did you have a nice rest?

889
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:58,839
I don't know what
you said or did

890
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:00,359
to deceive Harada or
my grandfather...

891
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:01,771
Now, now, calm down.

892
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:03,922
Your grandfather sought me out.

893
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:06,124
I am the head of
this family now.

894
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,971
And why do you suppose that is?

895
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:17,730
Why do you think the
old man chose you?

896
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:22,769
Because you are strong?

897
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:25,802
Or because you are weak?

898
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:22,644
I see you've come to fight.

899
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:23,961
It's pointless.

900
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:26,487
You're weak. You're
outnumbered.

901
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:30,645
The Black Clan has protected the
House of Yashida for 700 years.

902
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:33,724
Is that all the
men you brought?

903
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:38,650
I'm gonna get her.

904
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:41,282
We are grateful for your
protection of Mariko.

905
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:44,569
But there is one more sacrifice
you must make for her family.

906
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,002
Go fuck yourself, pretty boy.

907
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,001
Yukio, run!

908
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:04,446
Logan.

909
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:38,285
<i>Logan.</i>

910
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:39,447
<i>Kayla.</i>

911
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:40,721
<i>I love you. Kayla!</i>

912
01:48:40,840 --> 01:48:42,205
<i>Logan.</i>

913
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:48,605
<i>- Logan!</i>
<i>- Mariko!</i>

914
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,561
Jean.

915
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:54,011
<i>Save me.</i>

916
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:27,208
Stand back. There is no need.

917
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:29,329
Where is she? Where's Mariko?

918
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:30,441
Where is she?

919
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:33,522
"Where is Mariko?"

920
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:35,967
Still pining away?

921
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:37,963
That's so sweet.

922
01:49:39,080 --> 01:49:41,003
Impressive, no?

923
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:44,847
He is made of adamantium,
just like you.

924
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:59,206
Oh, Logan, you know what, I get it.
You're frustrated.

925
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:01,482
I know she's here.
I want to see her.

926
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:03,806
You want answers.

927
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:06,046
Yes, I want answers!

928
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:08,049
I'm sorry, I wish
I could say more,

929
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:10,049
but I was hired in part
for my discretion.

930
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:11,087
I'm sure you were.

931
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:13,401
That“

932
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:18,327
and a certain talent for combining
biochemistry and metaphysics.

933
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:21,770
High-grade toxins
are my specialty.

934
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:24,519
It helps to be
genetically immune

935
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:26,921
to every poison known
to man, as I am.

936
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:31,891
And immune to the toxin
that is man himself...

937
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:34,371
as I am.

938
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:37,201
I'll tell you what, you
twisted mutant bitch...

939
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:39,759
why don't you open
these bracelets

940
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:41,683
and we'll see who's
made of what?

941
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:48,959
The claws. Now we can begin.

942
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:53,847
I know you care for him.

943
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:55,810
You need to let go of that.

944
01:50:56,120 --> 01:50:58,168
You are a Yashida.

945
01:50:58,360 --> 01:51:00,328
She betrayed my grandfather...

946
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:02,091
and so have you.

947
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:03,482
No Mariko.

948
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:05,723
We grew up together.

949
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,411
You need to trust me.

950
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:10,363
Let me go to him!

951
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:13,000
He saved my life!

952
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:15,567
Let him go, Mariko!

953
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:17,080
This isn't easy for me but...

954
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:20,279
I'm following
Grandfather's wishes.

955
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:23,762
The suppressant bug you found
inside of you was mine.

956
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:26,691
You took it out on your own.

957
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:29,682
I didn't see that coming.

958
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:31,530
The Viper woman is evil...

959
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:33,489
we both know that.

960
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:36,450
But she's a means to an end...

961
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:37,762
Where is she?

962
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:39,639
An end your grandfather wanted.

963
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:40,766
You are strong.

964
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:42,844
You have courage.

965
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:44,959
Real courage.

966
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:51,330
But that won't help much now.

967
01:52:04,680 --> 01:52:05,806
What the...?

968
01:52:06,680 --> 01:52:08,284
You need to trust me.

969
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:10,211
Is that hard?

970
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:13,531
We were meant to be together.

971
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,048
We still can be.

972
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:18,405
Perhaps.

973
01:52:47,320 --> 01:52:48,082
Stop!

974
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:55,561
This is madness.

975
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:02,321
Let's go.

976
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:06,241
Go!

977
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:08,399
Run!

978
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:23,250
Come on.

979
01:53:38,920 --> 01:53:40,331
Mariko, come! Go! Run!

980
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:01,051
Mariko, get out!

981
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:13,485
Ahh!

982
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:51,086
Come on.

983
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:53,126
This is not the way.

984
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:08,170
Two hands.

985
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:13,726
Master...

986
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,128
Hey! Bub!

987
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:44,648
Harada.

988
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:52,845
I'm sorry.

989
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:44,287
Now, you die.

990
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:46,445
Today is not my day.

991
01:59:31,760 --> 01:59:33,091
Hey!

992
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:41,930
Logan-<i>San.</i>

993
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:44,128
Don't look so shocked.

994
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:50,366
With you at my side,
I survived Nagasaki.

995
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:53,171
Surely, I could survive this.

996
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:57,644
It's all right. It
won't take long.

997
01:59:58,200 --> 02:00:01,204
Dr. Green and I
have been waiting.

998
02:00:01,480 --> 02:00:05,041
It's only this armor
that's kept me alive.

999
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:10,127
We built it to make me strong, so I
can take what you would not give.

1000
02:00:10,280 --> 02:00:13,489
And transfer your
unwanted healing...

1001
02:00:14,360 --> 02:00:16,567
to my body.

1002
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:22,128
My legacy must be preserved.

1003
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:26,407
Your mistake was to believe
that a life without end...

1004
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:27,846
can have no meaning.

1005
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:33,650
It is the only life that can.

1006
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:36,525
Hold on.

1007
02:00:36,680 --> 02:00:38,523
We are almost there.

1008
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:42,685
The peace, the peace
you've wanted.

1009
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:45,322
Your reward.

1010
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:49,163
You know, I'm giving
you the very death...

1011
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:51,882
you longed for.

1012
02:01:04,680 --> 02:01:05,727
This feeling...

1013
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:09,406
to be invincible...

1014
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:13,729
like you.

1015
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:28,727
You are a monster.

1016
02:01:29,160 --> 02:01:30,321
Mariko.

1017
02:01:31,080 --> 02:01:33,560
It's me. Your grandfather.

1018
02:01:35,400 --> 02:01:37,004
I buried my grandfather.

1019
02:02:40,160 --> 02:02:42,811
You asked me to
come say goodbye.

1020
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:45,169
Sayonara.

1021
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:09,363
Are you all right?

1022
02:03:18,680 --> 02:03:19,681
Logan.

1023
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:31,689
Logan.

1024
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:35,886
Logan.

1025
02:03:48,040 --> 02:03:49,485
You're here.

1026
02:03:51,720 --> 02:03:53,404
Of course.

1027
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:57,008
Can you stay?

1028
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:01,202
I can't.

1029
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:05,244
Yes, you can.

1030
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:09,247
This is what you wanted.

1031
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:12,725
Not anymore.

1032
02:04:17,640 --> 02:04:20,246
I'm all alone here.

1033
02:04:24,480 --> 02:04:26,608
You put me here.

1034
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:30,926
You were hurting people, Jean.

1035
02:04:32,160 --> 02:04:33,650
I had to.

1036
02:04:42,160 --> 02:04:44,322
I love you, Jean.

1037
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:51,683
I always will.

1038
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:31,250
You are my only family.

1039
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:35,167
Be well, sister.

1040
02:05:48,600 --> 02:05:51,809
Am I wrong to think you
might visit me soon?

1041
02:06:03,360 --> 02:06:04,646
Stay.

1042
02:06:06,320 --> 02:06:07,810
I can't, princess.

1043
02:06:08,720 --> 02:06:10,239
I'm a soldier,

1044
02:06:10,240 --> 02:06:12,004
and I've been hiding too long.

1045
02:06:25,720 --> 02:06:28,371
<i>In our business profile
tonight, Mariko Yashida.</i>

1046
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:31,330
<i>A two-generation passing of the
torch in the Yashida family...</i>

1047
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:34,319
<i>as Mariko Yashida takes the
helm from her grandfather,</i>

1048
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:35,481
<i>who built this tech giant.</i>

1049
02:06:35,640 --> 02:06:37,799
I know it will always
be the purpose

1050
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:39,882
for a corporation
to make a profit...

1051
02:06:40,040 --> 02:06:44,329
but Yashida Industries believes we
can also work with our community.

1052
02:06:50,640 --> 02:06:52,847
So, have you decided?

1053
02:06:55,560 --> 02:06:56,322
What?

1054
02:06:56,760 --> 02:06:59,047
Mariko says we can
go wherever we want.

1055
02:06:59,200 --> 02:07:00,929
Just say where.

1056
02:07:02,160 --> 02:07:03,491
What are you doing?

1057
02:07:05,600 --> 02:07:07,409
I'm your bodyguard.

1058
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,650
So, where do you want to go?

1059
02:07:15,880 --> 02:07:16,927
Uh...

1060
02:07:17,480 --> 02:07:19,403
Let's just start with up.

1061
02:07:19,560 --> 02:07:21,210
And then?

1062
02:07:25,240 --> 02:07:26,924
We'll see.

1063
02:07:29,320 --> 02:07:30,606
Interesting.

1064
02:09:22,120 --> 02:09:24,282
<i>With cutting edge technology,</i>

1065
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:26,368

1066
02:09:26,520 --> 02:09:28,090

1067

1068
02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:34,002
<i>Trask Industries.</i>

1069
02:09:34,200 --> 02:09:36,487
<i>Solving tomorrow's
problems, today.</i>

1070
02:09:37,400 --> 02:09:38,765
I'll take the pat-down.

1071
02:09:38,920 --> 02:09:39,921
Opt out.

1072
02:09:52,880 --> 02:09:54,119
You can go ahead, sir.

1073
02:09:54,120 --> 02:09:55,246
I'll wait.

1074
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:05,330
What do you want?

1075
02:10:07,080 --> 02:10:09,606
There are dark
forces, Wolverine.

1076
02:10:11,280 --> 02:10:13,362
Human forces
building a weapon...

1077
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:16,922
that could bring about
the end of our kind.

1078
02:10:19,760 --> 02:10:22,889
What do I want? I
want your help.

1079
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:24,964
Why would I trust you?

1080
02:10:26,120 --> 02:10:27,451
You wouldn't.

1081
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:53,451
Hello, Logan.

1082
02:10:57,760 --> 02:10:59,649
How is this possible?

1083
02:10:59,800 --> 02:11:02,565
As I told you a
long time ago...

1084
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:06,479
you are not the only
one with gifts.
