1
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:42,960
Things are never gonna be the same now.

2
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:45,171
I mean, look at this.

3
00:00:45,338 --> 00:00:47,381
You got aliens.

4
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,801
You got big green guys
tearing down buildings.

5
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:54,263
When I was a kid, I used
to draw cowboys and Indians.

6
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,975
Actually, it's Native American,
but whatever.

7
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,937
Yeah. Tell you what, though.

8
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,522
It ain't bad, is it?

9
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:05,441
No. Yeah.

10
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:07,485
Kid's got a future.

11
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:09,445
Yeah, well...

12
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,739
...we'll see, I guess.

13
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:37,515
No, hey!

14
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:40,101
You can't saw through that stuff.

15
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,104
These alien bastards are tough.

16
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:45,231
You gotta use the stuff they use.

17
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,236
- See? All right.
- All right.

18
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,739
Oh, hey!

19
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,200
Glad you could join us. Afternoon.

20
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:58,619
- Yeah. My alarm didn't go off.
- Yeah, your alarm.

21
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:01,497
Look, just go stack that armor
plating like I asked you.

22
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:03,457
This is a huge deal for us.

23
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,084
Attention, please!

24
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:08,087
In accordance with Executive Order 396B...

25
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:11,799
...all post-battle cleanup operations
are now under our jurisdiction.

26
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:14,051
Thank you for your service.
We'll take it from here.

27
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:15,511
Who the hell are you?

28
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:17,138
Qualified personnel.

29
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:21,642
Look, I have a city contract to salvage
all this, okay, with the city, so...

30
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:26,397
I apologize, Mr. Toomes, but all salvage
operations are now under our jurisdiction.

31
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:29,859
Please turn over any and all exotic
materials that you've collected...

32
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:31,360
...or you will be prosecuted.

33
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:33,487
Ma'am, what am...?

34
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,532
Please. Come here.
Hey, lady, come on.

35
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:38,284
Look...

36
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,953
...I bought trucks for this job.

37
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,496
I brought in a whole new crew.

38
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:45,166
These guys have a family.
I have a family.

39
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,460
I'm all in on this.
I could lose my house.

40
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:50,963
I'm sorry, sir.
There's nothing I can do.

41
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,257
Maybe next time, don't overextend yourself.

42
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:56,469
What'd you say?

43
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,014
Yeah.

44
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:02,850
He's right. I overextended myself.

45
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,686
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Don't do it.

46
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:08,356
Put them down.

47
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:13,444
If you have a grievance, you may
take it up with my superiors.

48
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,405
Your superiors. Who the hell are they?

49
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:19,200
<i>A joint venture between Stark
Industries and the government...</i>

50
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:21,952
<i>...the Department of Damage Control,
will oversee the collection...</i>

51
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:25,164
<i>...and storage of alien
and other exotic materials.</i>

52
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:28,125
Now the assholes who made this
mess are paid to clean it up.

53
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:29,543
Yeah, it's all rigged.

54
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,297
<i>Experts estimate there are over
1500 tons of exotic material...</i>

55
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:35,466
<i>...scattered throughout the tri-state area.</i>

56
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:37,301
Hey, chief!

57
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:40,971
We have another load from yesterday.
We're supposed to turn this in, right?

58
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,181
I ain't hauling it.

59
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:43,557
It's too bad.

60
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,644
We could have made some cool
stuff from all that alien junk.

61
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,940
I tell you what.

62
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,192
Let's keep it.

63
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,362
The world's changing.

64
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:02,952
It's time we change, too.

65
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:49,165
There you go, Mason.

66
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:56,172
Business is good.

67
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,297
New York. Queens.

68
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:41,926
- It's a rough borough, but, hey, it's home.
- Who you talking to?

69
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,261
No one. Just making
a little video of the trip.

70
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:46,847
- You know you can't show it to anyone.
- Yeah, I know.

71
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,849
Then why are you narrating in that voice?

72
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,602
- Because it's fun.
- Fun.

73
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:54,772
So why do they call you Happy?

74
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:59,610
Come on.
I'm not carrying your bags. Let's go.

75
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,695
Hey, should I go to the bathroom before?

76
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,030
There's a bathroom on it.

77
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,324
No pilot? That's awesome.

78
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,077
- Is that where you're gonna sit?
- Yeah.

79
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:10,246
This is your first time on a private plane?

80
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,956
My first time on any plane.

81
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,875
Should it...? Should it be...?
Should it be making that noise?

82
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:27,846
No one has actually told me why
I'm in Berlin or what I'm doing.

83
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:31,225
<i>Something about Captain America going crazy.</i>

84
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:33,185
- This is you.
- Oh, we're neighbors?

85
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:35,437
We're not roommates. Suit up.

86
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:36,939
Okay, Peter, you got this.

87
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:40,192
- What the hell are you wearing?
- It's my suit.

88
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:42,152
- Where's the case?
- What case?

89
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,904
What? I thought that was a closet.

90
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,322
- This is still my room?
- Go.

91
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,283
- My room is way bigger than...
- There.

92
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,201
I found the case. I found the case.

93
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:51,954
"A minor upgrade"?

94
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:55,040
Oh, my God.

95
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:56,417
- Put it on.
- What the...?

96
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:58,502
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen...

97
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,005
- Let's go.
- But, yeah. Well, I don't understand.

98
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,549
Is it for me? Happy. Happy, wait.

99
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,594
This is insane. Insane.

100
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,887
Look at this thing.
Look. Look at the eyes.

101
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,348
- This is the greatest day of my life.
- Let's go.

102
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:15,644
Okay, there's Captain America, Iron Man,
Black Widow. Who's that new guy?

103
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:18,981
- Underoos!
- Oh, that's me. I gotta go. I gotta go.

104
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,942
Hey, everyone.

105
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:24,862
The craziest thing just happened.

106
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:28,699
I just had a fight with Captain America.
I stole his shield. I threw it at him...

107
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:32,036
What the hell? He's big now.
I gotta go. Hang on.

108
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:37,541
It was the most amazing thing!
Mr. Stark was like, "Hey, Underoos!"

109
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:41,045
I flipped in and stole Cap's shield.
I was like, "What's up, everybody?"

110
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,838
And then... Hey, just a second!

111
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:44,715
Coming!

112
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:47,301
Hey.

113
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:49,261
We have thin walls here.

114
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,223
What are you doing, a little video diary?

115
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,184
- Yeah.
- It's all right.

116
00:07:55,351 --> 00:07:56,894
- I'd do the same thing.
- I told him not to.

117
00:07:57,061 --> 00:07:59,229
- He was filming. I'm gonna wipe the chip.
- Okay.

118
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,439
Hey. You know what?

119
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:03,942
We should make an alibi video
for your aunt anyway. You ready?

120
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,528
- An alibi? Sure. Okay.
- We rolling? Get in the frame.

121
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:10,407
Hey, May. How you doing? What are
you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope.

122
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,119
Peter, that's inappropriate.
Let's start over. You can edit it.

123
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:16,205
Three, two, one. Hey, May.

124
00:08:16,372 --> 00:08:21,877
My gosh, I wanted to tell you what
an incredible job your nephew did...

125
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:25,923
...this weekend at the Stark internship retreat.

126
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,716
Everyone was impressed.

127
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,010
Come on! It's a freaking merge.
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,720
This is because you're not
on Queens Boulevard.

129
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,890
See, Happy is hoping to get
bumped up to asset management.

130
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:37,685
He was forehead of security,
before that he was a driver.

131
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,812
That was a private conversation.

132
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,356
I don't like joking about this.
It was hard to talk about that.

133
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:45,984
- No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch?
- Here we are. End of the line.

134
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,322
- Can you give us a moment?
- Want me to leave?

135
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:51,949
Grab Peter's case out of the trunk.

136
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,160
I can keep the suit?

137
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,413
Yes, we were just talking about it.

138
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,583
Do me a favor, though.
Happy's kind of your point guy on this.

139
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,919
Don't stress him out.
Don't do anything stupid.

140
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:06,004
I've seen his cardiogram.

141
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,756
- All right?
- Yes.

142
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:11,301
Don't do anything I would do,
and don't do anything I wouldn't do.

143
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:14,430
There's a little gray area in there.
That's where you operate.

144
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,724
- Wait, does that mean I'm an Avenger?
- No.

145
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,976
- This it?
- Seventh floor.

146
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:21,562
- I can take that. You don't have to.
- You'll take it?

147
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:24,106
- Yeah, I can take that.
- Thank you.

148
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,068
So when's our next...?
When's our next "retreat," you know?

149
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,863
- What, next mission?
- Yeah, the mission. The missions.

150
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,865
- We'll call you.
- Do you have my numbers?

151
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,241
No, I mean, we'll call you.

152
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,577
Like, someone will call you. All right?

153
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:38,996
- From your team.
- Okay. All right.

154
00:09:39,163 --> 00:09:43,000
It's not a hug. I'm just grabbing
the door for you. We're not there yet.

155
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,712
Bye.

156
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,635
They're gonna call me.

157
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:44,728
What's up, Penis Parker?

158
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,442
<i>Rise and shine, Midtown Science and Technology.</i>

159
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,569
<i>Don't forget about your homecoming tickets.</i>

160
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,363
<i>Do you have a date for homecoming?</i>

161
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,657
<i>Thanks, Jason, but I already have a date.</i>

162
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:58,784
<i>- Okay.
- Yeah.</i>

163
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:08,544
Damn it. You, in my office right now.

164
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,481
Join me, and together...

165
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,942
...we'll build my new LEGO Death Star.

166
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,862
- What?
- So lame.

167
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,613
That's awesome. How many pieces?

168
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,615
Three thousand eight hundred and three.

169
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:42,035
- That's insane.
- I know. You want to build it tonight?

170
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,121
No, I can't tonight. I've got the Stark...

171
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:45,956
- Stark internship.
- Yeah, exactly.

172
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:47,374
Always got that internship.

173
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,460
Yeah, well, hopefully, soon it'll
lead to a real job with them.

174
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,129
- That would be so sweet.
- Right?

175
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:54,673
He'd be all, "Good job
on those spreadsheets, Peter.

176
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,508
Here's a gold coin."

177
00:11:56,842 --> 00:12:00,178
- I don't know how jobs work.
- That's exactly how they work.

178
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:03,056
I'll knock out the bones of the Death Star.

179
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:07,144
I'll come by afterwards. For the most part,
the difficult thing is the base of it.

180
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:10,647
The top half we can knock out
in two hours, tops.

181
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,817
That'd be great.

182
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,319
I'm gonna be late.

183
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,821
Okay, so how do we calculate
linear acceleration...

184
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:21,074
...between points A and B?

185
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,284
Flash.

186
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:25,495
It's the product of sine of the angle
and gravity divided by mass.

187
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,957
Nope. Peter. You still with us?

188
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,377
Yeah, yeah.

189
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,882
Mass cancels out, so it's
just gravity times sine.

190
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:40,928
Right. See, Flash, being the fastest
isn't always the best if you are wrong.

191
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,721
You're dead.

192
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:50,395
Today we're talking about
Danish physicist Niels Bohr...

193
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:53,231
...but trust me, there's nothing Bohr-ing...

194
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:56,693
...about his discoveries
regarding quantum theory.

195
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:08,705
Did Liz get a new top?

196
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:12,626
No. We've seen that before,
but never with that skirt.

197
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:15,629
- Liz, hey. That looks so good.
- Hi!

198
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,423
We should probably stop staring
before it gets creepy.

199
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,841
Too late.

200
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,677
You guys are losers.

201
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,054
Well, then why do you sit with us?

202
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,764
Because I don't have any friends.

203
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:29,768
Next question.

204
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:32,437
What is the heaviest
naturally-occurring element?

205
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:34,690
Hydrogen's the lightest.

206
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,316
That's not the question. Okay.

207
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,693
- Yeah.
- Uranium.

208
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:39,945
Correct. Thank you, Abraham.

209
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:42,155
- Yes.
- Please open your books to page 10.

210
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,533
Peter, it's nationals.

211
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,910
Is there no way you could
take one weekend off?

212
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:51,039
I can't go to Washington. If Mr. Stark
needs me, I have to make sure I'm here.

213
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,583
You've never been in the
same room as Tony Stark.

214
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,002
Wait. What's happening?

215
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,129
- Peter's not going to Washington.
- No.

216
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,464
- No, no, no.
- Why not?

217
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,341
Really? Right before nationals?

218
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:04,177
He already quit marching
band and robotics lab.

219
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,597
I'm not obsessed with him.
Just very observant.

220
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:10,017
Flash, you're in for Peter.

221
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,310
I don't know.
I gotta check my calendar first.

222
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,688
I got a hot date with
Black Widow coming up.

223
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,648
That is false.

224
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:20,193
What'd I tell you about using
the bell for comedic purposes?

225
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,587
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, man.

226
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:41,882
What's up, Mr. Delmar?

227
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,592
Hey, Mr. Parker.

228
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:44,968
Number five, right?

229
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:48,638
Yeah, and with pickles, and can you
smush it down real flat? Thanks.

230
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,265
You got it, boss.

231
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:51,975
How's your aunt?

232
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,643
Yeah, she's all right.

233
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:57,355
She's a very hot Italian woman.

234
00:14:58,065 --> 00:14:59,566
How's your daughter?

235
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,196
- Ten dollars.
- It's 5 dollars.

236
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:08,075
- For that comment, 10 dollars.
- Hey, come on. I'm joking. I'm joking.

237
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,577
Here's 5 dollars.

238
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:13,246
What's up, Murph?

239
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:15,373
How you doing, buddy?

240
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,627
So how's school?

241
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:20,754
It's boring. Got better things to do.

242
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:24,174
Stay in school, kid.
Otherwise, you're gonna end up like me.

243
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,886
- This is great.
- Best sandwiches in Queens.

244
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:38,582
Finally.

245
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,089
- What's the matter with you?
- Could you hold this?

246
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:47,591
Thanks.

247
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,928
Hey, is this anybody's bike? No?

248
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:54,514
- Hey, buddy, is this your bike?
- I have no change.

249
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,975
Does anyone have a pen?
Do you have a pen?

250
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,439
Everybody good?

251
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:09,779
Hey!

252
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,741
You're that spider guy on YouTube, right?

253
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:13,950
Call me Spider-Man.

254
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,620
Okay, Spider-Man. Do a flip.

255
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:20,332
- Yeah!
- Not bad.

256
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,179
Hey, buddy.

257
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,391
- Shouldn't steal cars, it's bad.
- It's my car, dumb-ass!

258
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,268
Hey! Shut that off!

259
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,479
- Can you tell him it's my car?
- I was...

260
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:45,190
- I work at nights. Come on.
- That's not your car!

261
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,484
- That's his car.
- How was I supposed to know?

262
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:50,028
- He was putting that in the window!
- Every day with these alarms!

263
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:53,031
- Turn it off!
- Don't make me come down there, punk.

264
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,867
Hey, Gary. How you doing?

265
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:58,370
Marjorie, how are you?
How's your mother?

266
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,753
I'm good, I'm good.

267
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:09,381
<i>You have reached the voicemail box of:</i>

268
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,007
<i>Happy Hogan.</i>

269
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:13,385
Hey, Happy.
Here's my report for tonight.

270
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,053
I stopped a grand theft bicycle.

271
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,764
Couldn't find the owner,
so I just left a note.

272
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,226
I helped this lost, old Dominican lady.

273
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:24,271
She was really nice and bought me a churro.

274
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:27,607
I just feel like I could be doing more.

275
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,986
You know? Just curious when
the next real mission's gonna be.

276
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,446
So, yeah, just call me back.

277
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,366
It's Peter. Parker.

278
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:43,748
Why would I tell him about the churro?

279
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,004
Hey, hey.

280
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,843
Okay.

281
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:59,097
- Can't wait to see this thing.
- Finally, something good.

282
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,853
Yo, this high-tech stuff makes it too easy.

283
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,856
- Told you it was worth it.
- Okay, go, go, go.

284
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,737
Oh, nice.

285
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,740
We can hit, like, five more places tonight.

286
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,462
What's up, guys?
You forget your PIN number?

287
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:31,921
You're the Avengers.

288
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,007
What are you guys doing here?

289
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:38,762
Thor. Hulk.
Good to finally meet you guys.

290
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,432
I thought you'd be more
handsome in person. Iron Man.

291
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:45,518
Hey, what are you doing robbing a bank?
You're a billionaire.

292
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,356
Hey...

293
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,524
Oh, this feels so weird.

294
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:55,612
What is that thing?

295
00:19:55,779 --> 00:20:00,033
I'm starting to think
you're not the Avengers.

296
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,747
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

297
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:10,502
Spider-Man is fighting the Avengers
in a bank on 21st Street.

298
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,504
Let's wrap this up. It's a school night.

299
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:19,052
So how do jerks like you get tech like this?

300
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:23,014
No. Wait, wait, wait!

301
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:29,437
Mr. Delmar.

302
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:33,858
Hey, Mr. Delmar, you in here?
Is anybody in here? Hello?

303
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,828
Oh, come on.

304
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,248
I gotta...

305
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,875
- Here, here.
- Good, yeah.

306
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,337
Okay. Good. Yes.

307
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:55,922
Yes... No. No, put that down.

308
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:59,217
That's worth more than you or me. Yeah?

309
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:02,470
The craziest thing just happened.
These guys were robbing an ATM...

310
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:04,848
- ...with high-tech weapons...
- Take a breath. I don't have time...

311
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,891
- ...for ATM robberies...
- <i>Yeah, but...</i>

312
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:10,311
...or the notes you leave.
I have moving day to worry about.

313
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,188
<i>Everything's gotta be out next week.</i>

314
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,984
- Wait. You're moving? Who's moving?
- Yeah, don't you watch the news?

315
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:19,446
Tony sold Avengers Tower.
We're relocating to a new facility upstate...

316
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,824
- ...where hopefully cell service is worse.
- But what about me?

317
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,742
What about you?

318
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,954
Well, what if Mr. Stark needs me
or something big goes down?

319
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:31,583
- <i>Can I please talk to Mr. Stark?</i>
- Stay away from anything dangerous.

320
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:34,502
I'm responsible for making sure
you're responsible, okay?

321
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,882
I am responsible. I... Oh, crap.

322
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,468
- <i>My backpack's gone.</i>
- That doesn't sound responsible.

323
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,637
- <i>I'll call you back.</i>
- Feel free not to.

324
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:46,783
What was that?

325
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,327
It's nothing. Nothing.

326
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:51,204
You're the Spider-Man.

327
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:54,207
- From YouTube.
- I'm not. I'm not.

328
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:56,668
- You were on the ceiling.
- No. What are you doing in my room?

329
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,753
May let me in.
We were gonna finish the Death Star.

330
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,130
You can't just bust into my room!

331
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,008
That turkey meatloaf recipe is a disaster.

332
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:06,803
Let's go to dinner.
Thai? Ned, you want Thai?

333
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,221
- Yes.
- No. He's got a thing.

334
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:10,974
A thing to do after.

335
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:13,017
Okay.

336
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:15,853
Maybe put on some clothes.

337
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:19,357
- Oh, she doesn't know?
- Nobody knows.

338
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:21,776
Mr. Stark knows because
he made my suit. That's it.

339
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:25,154
Tony Stark made you that?
Are you an Avenger?

340
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:27,907
Yeah, basically.

341
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:32,370
You can't tell anybody about this.
You gotta keep it a secret.

342
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:34,372
- Secret? Why?
- You know what she's like.

343
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:37,542
If she finds out people try and kill me
every night, she won't let me do this.

344
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:38,918
Come on, Ned, please.

345
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:40,795
Okay, okay, okay.

346
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:43,673
I'll level with you.
I can't keep this a secret.

347
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,592
It's the greatest thing that's
ever happened to me.

348
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:48,428
Ned, May cannot know.
I cannot do that to her right now.

349
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:52,348
You know? I mean, everything that's
happened with her, I... Please.

350
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:57,395
- Okay.
- Just swear it, okay?

351
00:23:57,854 --> 00:23:58,896
I swear.

352
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:01,107
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

353
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:03,192
I can't believe this is happening now.

354
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,611
- Can I try the suit on?
- No.

355
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,613
How's it work? Magnets?
How do you shoot the strings?

356
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,990
- I'm gonna tell you at school tomorrow.
- Great.

357
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:11,117
Okay, well, wait, then.

358
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:14,787
How do you do this and the Stark internship?

359
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:18,041
This is the Stark internship.

360
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,252
Just get out of here.

361
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,465
<i>What's the matter?</i>

362
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:27,550
Thought you loved larb.

363
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,886
It's too larby?

364
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:32,764
Not larby enough.

365
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:37,518
How many times do I have to say
"larb" before you talk to me?

366
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,854
You know I larb you.

367
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:43,066
I'm just stressed.
The internship, and I'm tired.

368
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,275
A lot of work.

369
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:46,694
The Stark internship.

370
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:50,531
I have to tell you, not
a fan of that Tony Stark.

371
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:54,911
You're distracted all the time.
He's got you in your head.

372
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:58,164
- <i>Delmar's Sandwiches was destroyed...</i>
- What does he have you doing?

373
00:24:58,331 --> 00:24:59,916
- <i>...in an explosion...</i>
- You need to use your instincts.

374
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:03,211
<i>...after an ATM robbery was thwarted
by Queens' own crime stopper...</i>

375
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:04,462
What?

376
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,172
<i>...the Spider-Man.</i>

377
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:08,675
<i>As the Spider-Man attempted
to foil their heist...</i>

378
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:12,512
<i>...a powerful blast was set off, slicing
through the bodega across the street.</i>

379
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:14,722
<i>Miraculously, no one was harmed.</i>

380
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:18,976
If you spot something like that happening,
you turn and you run the other way.

381
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:20,895
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.

382
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:22,355
Six blocks away from us.

383
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:24,524
I need a new backpack.

384
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,152
- What?
- I need a new backpack.

385
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:29,821
That's five.

386
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,366
- Sticky rice pudding.
- We didn't order that.

387
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,368
It's on the house.

388
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:37,412
Thanks.

389
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:41,457
That's nice of him.

390
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:44,210
I think he larbs you.

391
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,338
<i>You got bit by a spider?</i>

392
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:48,965
Can it bite me?

393
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:50,967
Well, it probably would've hurt, right?

394
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:53,428
Whatever.
Even if it did hurt, I'd let it bite me.

395
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,179
Maybe. How much did it hurt?

396
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:57,557
The spider's dead, Ned.

397
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,900
You were here?

398
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:10,027
Yeah.

399
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,822
You could've died.

400
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:17,201
Do you lay eggs?

401
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:19,078
What? No.

402
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:24,292
- Can you spit venom?
- No.

403
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:26,753
Can you summon an army of spiders?

404
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,004
No, Ned.

405
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:31,090
The Sokovia Accords were put into place...

406
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:33,551
How far can you shoot your webs?

407
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:34,927
It's unknown. Shut up.

408
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,345
...to begin regulating...

409
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,848
If I was you, I would stand on a building...

410
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:42,393
- ...and just shoot it as far as I could...
- Shut up, Ned.

411
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,439
<i>Hi. I'm Captain America. Whether you're
in the classroom or on the battlefield...</i>

412
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:48,274
- Do you know him too?
- Yeah, we met.

413
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:49,901
<i>...fitness can be the difference
between success or failure.</i>

414
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,153
- I stole his shield.
- What?

415
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,363
<i>Today, my good friend,
your gym teacher...</i>

416
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,158
<i>...will conduct the Captain America
Fitness Challenge.</i>

417
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:58,409
Thank you, Captain.

418
00:26:58,576 --> 00:27:01,621
Pretty sure he's a war criminal,
but I have to show these videos.

419
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:03,998
It's required by the state. Let's do it.

420
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:05,666
Do Avengers have to pay taxes?

421
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,460
What does Hulk smell like?

422
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:09,629
- I bet he smells nice.
- You have to shut up.

423
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:12,507
Is Captain America cool,
or is he like a mean, old grandpa?

424
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,592
Ned, just... okay?

425
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:18,262
- Hey, can I be your guy in the chair?
- What?

426
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:20,973
Yeah. You know how there's
a guy with a headset...

427
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,975
...telling the other guy where to go?

428
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,978
If you're in a burning building,
I could tell you where to go.

429
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,731
There'd be screens around me,
and I could swivel around.

430
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:31,984
- I could be your guy in the chair.
- I don't need a guy in the chair.

431
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,820
Looking good, Parker.

432
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:39,492
Now, see, for me, it would be F Thor...

433
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,536
...marry Iron Man and kill Hulk.

434
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,538
Well, what about the Spider-Man?

435
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:44,914
It's just Spider-Man.

436
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:48,292
Did you see the bank security cam on YouTube?
He fought off four guys.

437
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:50,294
Oh, my God, she's crushing on Spider-Man.

438
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:51,546
No way.

439
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,756
- Kind of.
- Oh, gross.

440
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,843
- He's probably 30.
- You don't know what he looks like.

441
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,970
Like, what if he's seriously burned?

442
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:01,848
I wouldn't care.
I'd love him for the person he is inside.

443
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,891
Peter knows Spider-Man.

444
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:08,855
No, I don't. No. I... I mean...

445
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,357
They're friends.

446
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:14,485
Yeah, like Coach Wilson and
Captain America are friends.

447
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,363
I've met him, yeah. A couple times.

448
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:18,906
But it's...

449
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:21,784
...through the Stark internship.

450
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,580
Yeah, well, I'm not really
supposed to talk about it.

451
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,623
Well, that's awesome.
Hey, you know what?

452
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,459
Maybe you should invite him
to Liz's party. Right?

453
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:33,921
Yeah, I'm having people over tonight.
You're more than welcome to come.

454
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:36,507
- Having a party?
- Yeah, it's gonna be dope.

455
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:39,468
You should totally invite your
personal friend Spider-Man.

456
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,178
It's okay.

457
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:44,056
I know Peter's way too busy
for parties anyway, so...

458
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,058
Come on. He'll be there.
Right, Parker?

459
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:53,900
What are you doing?

460
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,568
Helping you out.

461
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:57,320
Did you not hear her?

462
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,947
Liz has a crush on you.

463
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:04,452
Dude, you're an Avenger.

464
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:08,497
If any one of us has a chance
with a senior girl, it's you.

465
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,295
House party in the suburbs.

466
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:17,840
Oh, I remember these.
Kind of jealous.

467
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:20,217
It'll be a night to remember.

468
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:23,512
Ned, some hats wear men.
You wear that hat.

469
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,640
Yeah, it gives me confidence.

470
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:27,016
This is a mistake.

471
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:28,434
Hey, let's just go home.

472
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:30,061
Oh, Peter.

473
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,980
I know. I know it's really hard...

474
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:36,400
...trying to fit in with all the changes
your body's going through.

475
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:37,610
It's flowering now.

476
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:41,864
He's so stressed out lately.

477
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:43,616
What helps with stress is a party.

478
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:46,661
- We should go to the party.
- Yeah, let's do it. I'm gonna go.

479
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:49,705
Peter.

480
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:52,708
- Have fun, okay? Okay.
- I will.

481
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:54,752
Bye, May.

482
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:58,756
Dude, you have the suit, right?

483
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:01,175
- Yeah.
- This is gonna change our lives.

484
00:30:06,097 --> 00:30:08,015
- Annie, over here!
- Hey.

485
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:09,350
Hey.

486
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,355
<i>DJ Flash.</i>

487
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,483
Okay. We're gonna have
Spider-Man swing in...

488
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:21,612
...say you guys are tight, and I get
a fist bump or one of those half bro-hugs.

489
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:23,906
Can't believe you're at this lame party.

490
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:25,282
But you're here too.

491
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,994
Am I?

492
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:31,789
Oh, my gosh.

493
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:33,749
Hey, guys. Cool hat, Ned.

494
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,668
- Hi, Liz.
- Hi, Liz.

495
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:37,712
I'm so happy you guys came.

496
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:40,381
There's pizza and drinks. Help yourself.

497
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:43,843
- What a great party.
- Thanks.

498
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:47,763
Oh, I...

499
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,599
My parents will kill me
if anything's broken. I gotta...

500
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,226
- Yeah.
- Have fun.

501
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:54,353
- Bye.
- Bye.

502
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,522
Dude, what are you doing?

503
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:58,774
She's here. Spider it up.

504
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:01,569
No, no, no. I can't... I cannot do this.

505
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:03,988
Spider-Man is not a party trick, okay?

506
00:31:04,155 --> 00:31:06,824
Look, I'm just gonna be myself.

507
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:09,285
Peter, no one wants that.

508
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,245
Dude.

509
00:31:11,746 --> 00:31:14,540
Penis Parker, what's up?

510
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:16,542
So where's your pal Spider-Man?

511
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:19,253
Let me guess: In Canada
with your imaginary girlfriend?

512
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:24,884
That's not Spider-Man.
That's just Ned in a red shirt.

513
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:34,602
"Hey, what's up? I'm Spider-Man.

514
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:37,813
Just thought I'd swing by and
say hello to my buddy Peter.

515
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,149
Oh, what's up, Ned?
Hey, where's Peter, anyways?

516
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:42,151
He must be around..."

517
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:49,575
God, this is stupid. What am I doing?

518
00:31:58,667 --> 00:31:59,794
What the hell?

519
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:22,358
This sucks.

520
00:32:27,822 --> 00:32:31,909
Now, this is crafted from a reclaimed
sub-Ultron arm straight from Sokovia.

521
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:33,369
Here. You try.

522
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:38,332
I wanted something low-key.
Why are you trying to upsell me, man?

523
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:40,584
Okay, okay.
I got what you need, all right?

524
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:43,546
I got tons of great stuff here. One sec.

525
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:48,759
Okay, I got black hole grenades,
Chitauri railguns...

526
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:51,011
You letting off shots in public now?
Hurry up.

527
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:54,807
Look, times are changing. We're the only
ones selling these high-tech weapons.

528
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:58,227
This must be where
the ATM robbers got their stuff.

529
00:32:58,394 --> 00:33:02,773
I need something to stick up somebody.
I'm not trying to shoot them back in time.

530
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,151
I got antigrav climbers.

531
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,402
Yo, climbers?

532
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:10,197
Okay, what the hell is that?

533
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:14,368
- Did you set us up?
- Hey, hey, man.

534
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:20,708
Hey! Hey, come on. You gonna
shoot at somebody, shoot at me.

535
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:22,001
All right.

536
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,640
What was that?

537
00:33:47,735 --> 00:33:50,946
- We gotta call him.
- No, no, no.

538
00:33:56,744 --> 00:33:57,912
Did you just do it again?

539
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:00,247
- Shut up.
- I'm calling him.

540
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:11,342
Toomes's phone.

541
00:34:12,343 --> 00:34:13,886
Boss.

542
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:15,179
Oh, my butt!

543
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,993
Great. Guess I'm gonna
have to take a shortcut.

544
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:42,831
Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun.

545
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,750
Hey, hey, buddy.

546
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:47,419
Sorry, no time to play. Here, go fetch.

547
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:51,757
Now, this is more like it.

548
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:05,562
Smells really good.

549
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:11,193
Great movie!

550
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:18,284
Oh, hey, guys.

551
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:21,370
No! No!

552
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:24,248
<i>Hey, it's Peter. Leave a message.</i>

553
00:35:24,415 --> 00:35:25,916
Peter, where are you?

554
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,960
The hat's not working. This is not cool.

555
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:31,005
Almost got you.

556
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:45,477
Thought you got away
from me, didn't you?

557
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:47,855
I got you right where I want you.

558
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:50,858
Surprise!

559
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:55,946
What the hell?

560
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,953
Oh, hey.

561
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:51,460
And then he just, like,
swooped down like a monster...

562
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:55,172
...and picked me up, and took me up
like a thousand feet and just dropped me.

563
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:58,175
How'd you find me?
Did you put a tracker in my suit?

564
00:36:58,342 --> 00:37:00,177
I put everything in your suit.

565
00:37:00,344 --> 00:37:01,678
Including this heater.

566
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:07,351
That's better. Thanks.

567
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:08,685
What were you thinking?

568
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:12,147
The guy with wings is the source
of the weapons. I gotta take him down.

569
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:13,982
Take him down now, huh?

570
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,944
Crockett, there are people
who handle this sort of thing.

571
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:19,947
- The Avengers?
- No. This is a little below their pay grade.

572
00:37:20,114 --> 00:37:22,116
Mr. Stark, you didn't have to come out here.

573
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:23,700
I had that. I was fine.

574
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:27,287
<i>Oh, I'm not here.</i>

575
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,957
Thank God this place has Wi-Fi...

576
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:31,917
...or you would be toast right now.

577
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:35,087
Thank Ganesh while you're at it. Cheers.

578
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:37,423
<i>Look, forget the flying vulture guy, please.</i>

579
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:38,632
- Why?
- <i>Why?</i>

580
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:40,843
Because I said so!

581
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:44,012
Sorry, I'm talking to a teenager.

582
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,639
<i>Stay close to the ground.</i>

583
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:49,852
Build up your game helping little people,
like that lady that bought you the churro.

584
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:53,397
Can't you just be a friendly...

585
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:55,399
...neighborhood Spider-Man?

586
00:37:55,566 --> 00:37:57,276
But I'm ready for more than that now.

587
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:58,819
<i>No, you're not.</i>

588
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:01,280
That's not what you thought
when I took on Captain America.

589
00:38:01,447 --> 00:38:04,074
<i>Trust me, kid. If Cap wanted
to lay you out, he would've.</i>

590
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:08,996
<i>Listen to me. If you come across
these weapons again, call Happy.</i>

591
00:38:09,163 --> 00:38:10,622
Are you driving?

592
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,792
You know, it's never too early
to start thinking about college.

593
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,711
I got some pull at MIT. End call.

594
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:18,589
No, I don't need to go to...

595
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:20,799
<i>Mr. Stark is no longer connected.</i>

596
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,345
That's awesome.

597
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:31,435
"Stay close to the ground"?
What is he talking about?

598
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,164
Hey, what's up?
I'm on my way back.

599
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:55,542
Actually, I was calling to say
maybe you shouldn't come. Listen.

600
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:57,878
When I say "penis," you say "Parker."

601
00:38:58,045 --> 00:38:59,087
- Penis!
- Parker!

602
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,464
- Penis!
- Parker!

603
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:03,217
<i>Sorry, Peter. I guess we're still losers.</i>

604
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:06,303
- <i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>
- I'll see you tomorrow in school.

605
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:48,053
Idiots.

606
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,013
Idiots.

607
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,723
Idiots!

608
00:39:52,558 --> 00:39:53,600
Boss?

609
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:57,229
Your wife keeps texting you.
Something about a brake light.

610
00:39:57,646 --> 00:39:59,815
What'd I tell you about
looking at my phone?

611
00:39:59,982 --> 00:40:01,233
Sorry. You left it out.

612
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,235
You know I'm a curious person by nature.

613
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:08,282
I finished designing that
high-altitude vacuum seal.

614
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:12,536
In case you want to,
you know, go for the big one?

615
00:40:12,703 --> 00:40:14,746
You're still on that? I told you, no.

616
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,456
The answer's no. Forget it.

617
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,596
I mean, that was badass.

618
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:37,102
How many times have I told you
not to fire them out in the open?

619
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:39,813
- You said, move the merchandise.
- Under the radar.

620
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,189
Under the radar!

621
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,108
That's how we survive.

622
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:46,612
If you bring Damage Control or
the Avengers down here, we're through.

623
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:50,198
You're out there wearing that
goofy thing, lighting up cars...

624
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:51,867
...calling yourself the Shocker.

625
00:40:52,034 --> 00:40:55,162
"I'm the Shocker. I shock people."
What is this, pro wrestling?

626
00:40:55,329 --> 00:40:57,122
Whatever, old man. Come on.

627
00:40:58,582 --> 00:41:00,000
Look.

628
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:01,585
Look.

629
00:41:01,752 --> 00:41:04,421
I know you don't give
a crap about anything.

630
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:06,214
But I do.

631
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:09,509
I built this whole place because
I got people I have to look after.

632
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:12,888
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

633
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,558
You know what?

634
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:19,394
I can't afford your bullshit.

635
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:21,021
- Get out of here.
- What?

636
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:24,483
- You're done. You're off the crew.
- Yeah, all right.

637
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:26,401
All right.

638
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:28,987
Wonder if you can afford me
out there, though, right?

639
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:30,989
With everything I know.

640
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:34,785
- Excuse me?
- I'm just saying...

641
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:38,789
...maybe your wife would like to know
where you really get your money from.

642
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:41,208
- You know what?
- What?

643
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:42,751
You're right.

644
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:44,378
- That work?
- I don't know.

645
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:47,214
I can't afford that.

646
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:49,925
Wait.

647
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:58,058
Damn.

648
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:03,021
- I thought this was the antigravity gun.
- What?

649
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:04,272
No, that's that one.

650
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:18,787
Here.

651
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,959
Now you're the Shocker. Go out there
and find that weapon he lost.

652
00:42:24,126 --> 00:42:25,168
All right.

653
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:36,388
Hey, thanks for bailing on me.

654
00:42:36,555 --> 00:42:38,515
Yeah, well, something came up.

655
00:42:38,682 --> 00:42:39,891
What is that?

656
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:42,853
I don't know. Some guy tried
to vaporize me with it.

657
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,479
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

658
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:46,106
Awesome.

659
00:42:46,273 --> 00:42:49,359
I mean, not awesome.
Totally uncool of that guy.

660
00:42:49,526 --> 00:42:51,319
So scary.

661
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:54,322
Well, look, I think it's...

662
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:55,949
...a power source.

663
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:58,702
Yeah, but it's connected
to all these microprocessors.

664
00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:02,080
That's an inductive charging plate.
That's what I use to charge my toothbrush.

665
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:05,292
Whoever's making these weapons
is combining alien tech with ours.

666
00:43:05,459 --> 00:43:09,337
That is literally the coolest
sentence anyone has ever said.

667
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:12,549
I just want to thank you for letting
me be part of your journey...

668
00:43:12,716 --> 00:43:15,093
...into this amazing...

669
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:20,724
Keep your fingers clear of the blades.

670
00:43:22,851 --> 00:43:24,978
I gotta figure out what
this is and who makes it.

671
00:43:25,145 --> 00:43:27,355
We'll go to the lab after class and run tests.

672
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:28,815
Let's do it.

673
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:38,575
First, we put the glowy thing
in the mass spectrometer.

674
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:41,203
We gotta come up with a better
name than "glowy thingy."

675
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:42,454
You're right.

676
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,081
Crap.

677
00:43:45,707 --> 00:43:47,167
Come on, come on, come on.

678
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:53,381
High schools creep me out.

679
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,051
They got this funny smell, you know?

680
00:43:56,218 --> 00:43:58,512
Hey, that's one of the guys
that tried to kill me.

681
00:43:58,678 --> 00:43:59,721
What?

682
00:43:59,888 --> 00:44:01,389
- Yeah.
- We gotta get out of here.

683
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,433
No, no, no. I gotta follow them.

684
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,186
They can lead me to the guy
that dropped me in the lake.

685
00:44:06,353 --> 00:44:08,605
- Someone dropped you in a lake?
- Yeah, it was not good.

686
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:12,025
- Peter...
- No. Stay there, Ned.

687
00:44:12,192 --> 00:44:13,777
Peter.

688
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,073
What are you doing?

689
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,491
Nothing.

690
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:21,827
Yeah. You good?

691
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:23,036
Chess.

692
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:29,417
Man, can you imagine what the boss
would say if he knew where we were?

693
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:31,670
It's saying there was an energy pulse here.

694
00:44:31,837 --> 00:44:33,255
There's no sign of the weapon.

695
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:36,383
- And even if it was here, now it's gone.
- So are we.

696
00:45:08,999 --> 00:45:11,918
This is so awesome.

697
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:13,920
I know, right?

698
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:18,925
They're in Brooklyn.

699
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:25,056
Staten Island.

700
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:32,689
Leaving Jersey.

701
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:41,948
They stopped.

702
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:45,744
Maryland?

703
00:45:45,911 --> 00:45:48,163
- What's there?
- I don't know.

704
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:49,372
Evil lair?

705
00:45:49,915 --> 00:45:51,958
- They have a lair?
- A gang with alien guns...

706
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:53,919
...run by a guy with wings? Yeah.

707
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:55,503
Badass.

708
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,548
But how are you gonna get there
if it's, like, 300 miles away?

709
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,386
It's not too far from D.C.

710
00:46:04,471 --> 00:46:05,597
- Hey, it's Peter.
- Guys.

711
00:46:05,764 --> 00:46:06,806
- Peter?
- Hey, buddy.

712
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:08,850
I was hoping I could rejoin the team.

713
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:10,644
No, no way. You can't quit on us...

714
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,438
...stroll up and be welcomed back by everyone.

715
00:46:13,605 --> 00:46:16,483
Hey, welcome back!
Flash, you're back to first alternate.

716
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:17,984
- What?
- He's taking your place.

717
00:46:18,151 --> 00:46:19,527
Excuse me, can we go already?

718
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:23,490
I was hoping to get in some protesting
in front of an embassy before dinner.

719
00:46:23,657 --> 00:46:26,117
Protesting is patriotic.
Let's get on the bus.

720
00:46:28,078 --> 00:46:31,373
<i>Focus up. Our next topic
is the moons of Saturn.</i>

721
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:33,458
The second law of thermodynamics.

722
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,919
- Frank Sinatra.
- Fort Sumter.

723
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:38,922
- Flash is wrong.
- Okay, let's focus. Next one.

724
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:40,423
Liz, don't overwork them.

725
00:46:40,924 --> 00:46:42,634
Strontium, barium, vibranium.

726
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:44,678
Very good, Peter.
Glad to have you back.

727
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,304
Glad to be back.

728
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:50,141
- What is the current standard unit of...?
- Can I take this real quick?

729
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:51,810
Yeah, fine.

730
00:46:51,977 --> 00:46:53,770
- Hello?
- Got a blip on my screen here.

731
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:54,980
You left New York?

732
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:56,773
- Okay, focus up, everyone.
- Tracker.

733
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,067
Yeah, it's just a school trip. It's nothing.

734
00:46:59,234 --> 00:47:01,653
Happy, I gotta say,
tracking me without permission...

735
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,613
...is a complete violation of privacy.

736
00:47:04,406 --> 00:47:06,116
- That's different.
- What's different?

737
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:08,743
Nothing.
Look, it's just the Academic Decathlon.

738
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:11,997
- <i>It's no big deal.</i>
- Hey, hey. I'll decide if it's no big deal.

739
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:16,751
Sounds like no big deal,
but remember, I'm watching you.

740
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:30,724
- Everyone stick together.
- Yeah.

741
00:47:31,224 --> 00:47:33,059
You kidding me? This place is huge.

742
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:35,812
- I've seen bigger.
- There's a bird in here.

743
00:47:35,979 --> 00:47:39,232
- Hey, you brought your laptop, right?
- Why?

744
00:47:47,282 --> 00:47:48,658
Peter...

745
00:47:48,825 --> 00:47:51,828
...why are we removing
the tracker from your suit?

746
00:47:53,413 --> 00:47:56,458
I gotta follow these guys to their
boss before they move again...

747
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:59,586
...and I don't really want
Mr. Stark to know about it.

748
00:47:59,753 --> 00:48:01,588
So you're lying to Iron Man now?

749
00:48:01,755 --> 00:48:03,381
No, I'm not lying.

750
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:06,176
He just doesn't really get
what I can do yet.

751
00:48:10,764 --> 00:48:12,265
Gotcha.

752
00:48:12,432 --> 00:48:16,603
All right, Happy, enjoy tracking this lamp.

753
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:22,609
There's a ton of other
subsystems in here...

754
00:48:22,776 --> 00:48:26,404
...but they're all disabled
by the Training Wheels Protocol.

755
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:27,697
What?

756
00:48:27,864 --> 00:48:31,493
"Training Wheels Protocol"?
Turn it off.

757
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:34,579
I don't think that's a good idea.
They're blocked for a reason.

758
00:48:34,996 --> 00:48:37,332
Come on, man, I don't
need training wheels.

759
00:48:37,499 --> 00:48:39,876
I'm sick of him treating me
like a kid all the time.

760
00:48:40,043 --> 00:48:42,337
- It's not cool.
- But you are a kid.

761
00:48:42,504 --> 00:48:44,589
A kid who can stop a bus
with his bare hands.

762
00:48:44,756 --> 00:48:48,510
Peter, I just don't think this is a great idea.
I mean, what if this is illegal?

763
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:51,638
Look, please.
This is my chance to prove myself.

764
00:48:51,805 --> 00:48:53,556
I can handle it. Ned, come on.

765
00:48:53,723 --> 00:48:56,434
- I don't think this is a good idea.
- The guy in the chair.

766
00:48:56,893 --> 00:48:59,062
- Don't do that.
- Come on.

767
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:15,078
The glowy thing, it's evidence.
Keep it safe.

768
00:49:15,245 --> 00:49:16,830
- All right?
- Okay. Okay.

769
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:19,999
- They're moving.
- Be careful.

770
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:25,713
- Hey, Liz.
- Perfect timing.

771
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:27,298
We're gonna go swimming.

772
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:29,134
- Come on, come on, come on.
- What?

773
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:31,553
- Hey, Peter.
- Hi.

774
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:34,556
Hey.

775
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:39,018
I was... I was gonna go study
in the business center.

776
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:41,521
You don't need to.
You're the smartest guy I've ever met.

777
00:49:41,688 --> 00:49:42,981
And besides...

778
00:49:43,148 --> 00:49:46,943
...a rebellious group activity the day
before competition is good for morale.

779
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:50,488
Well, I read that in a TED Talk, so...

780
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:52,907
I... I heard it in a TED Talk.

781
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:54,993
And I read a coaching book.

782
00:49:56,077 --> 00:49:58,163
You really...
This is really important to you.

783
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:00,206
Yeah. It's our future.

784
00:50:00,373 --> 00:50:01,791
I'm not gonna screw it up.

785
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:06,713
Besides, we raided the minibar
and these candy bars were, like, $11.

786
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,133
- So get your trunks on and come on.
- Come on.

787
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,427
- Come on.
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

788
00:50:12,594 --> 00:50:13,636
Let's go.

789
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:39,787
- <i>Good evening, Peter.</i>
- Hello? Hello?

790
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:42,874
<i>Congratulations on completing
the Training Wheels Protocol...</i>

791
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:45,585
<i>...and gaining access
to your suit's full capabilities.</i>

792
00:50:45,752 --> 00:50:47,337
Thank you.

793
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:49,339
<i>Where would you like
to take me tonight?</i>

794
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:52,217
I put a tracker on someone.
He's a bad guy.

795
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,427
<i>Tracker located.</i>

796
00:50:54,886 --> 00:50:57,138
<i>Plotting course to intercept target.</i>

797
00:50:57,305 --> 00:51:00,391
As long as I make it back
in time for decathlon, it's fine.

798
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:11,110
<i>One hundred meters
from destination and closing.</i>

799
00:51:11,486 --> 00:51:13,112
<i>Jump now.</i>

800
00:51:17,617 --> 00:51:19,619
<i>Detecting three individuals.</i>

801
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:23,957
Why is their secret lair in a gas station?
That's so lame.

802
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,754
Hey, suit lady, what are they doing?

803
00:51:29,921 --> 00:51:31,214
<i>Do you want to hear
what they're saying?</i>

804
00:51:31,381 --> 00:51:33,841
I can hear what they're saying?
Yeah.

805
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:35,927
<i>Activating Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.</i>

806
00:51:36,094 --> 00:51:39,013
I got the gauntlet from the Lagos cleanup.
The rest is my design.

807
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,515
Whoa, that's so cool.

808
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:42,517
Can't believe they're still
cleaning up that Triskelion mess.

809
00:51:42,684 --> 00:51:44,686
I love it. They keep making messes...

810
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:47,230
- ...we keep getting rich.
- Target inbound.

811
00:51:47,397 --> 00:51:49,023
They're in the middle of a heist.

812
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:51,359
I could catch them red-handed.
This is awesome.

813
00:51:51,526 --> 00:51:53,820
Okay, I'll get closer to see what's happening.

814
00:51:53,987 --> 00:51:56,698
<i>Would you like me to engage
Enhanced Combat Mode?</i>

815
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:59,200
"Enhanced Combat Mode"?
Yeah.

816
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:00,827
<i>Activating Instant Kill.</i>

817
00:52:00,994 --> 00:52:03,079
No, no, no.
I don't want to kill anybody.

818
00:52:03,246 --> 00:52:05,540
<i>Deactivating Instant Kill.</i>

819
00:52:08,501 --> 00:52:10,253
Did you hear that?

820
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:12,630
What the hell just happened?
What was that?

821
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:15,216
<i>You jumped off the sign
and landed on your face.</i>

822
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:19,095
What's wrong with my web-shooters?

823
00:52:19,262 --> 00:52:21,597
<i>Rapid-fire is the default
for Enhanced Combat Mode.</i>

824
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:24,475
- Why would I need rapid-fire?
- <i>Would you like to see more options?</i>

825
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:27,645
<i>You have 576 possible
web-shooter combinations.</i>

826
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:29,522
Mr. Stark really overdid it.

827
00:52:29,689 --> 00:52:30,857
You two wait right here.

828
00:52:31,024 --> 00:52:33,151
Wait. You're gonna want
to turn on the dampers.

829
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:36,654
- That thing will shatter your arm.
- All right, where's the dampers?

830
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:38,489
- That one.
- <i>Great choice.</i>

831
00:52:38,865 --> 00:52:41,242
<i>Would you like me to set
this as your new default?</i>

832
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:43,786
No, no, no.

833
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:46,497
- Push that in. No, the other...
- Here? This one here?

834
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:49,000
- What was that?
- <i>Taser webs.</i>

835
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:51,002
Taser webs? I don't want Taser webs.

836
00:52:51,169 --> 00:52:53,671
<i>You seem to be unfamiliar
with your web-shooter settings.</i>

837
00:52:54,172 --> 00:52:55,882
<i>Would you like to run a refresher course?</i>

838
00:52:56,049 --> 00:52:58,384
- No. Just... You choose.
- <i>Sure thing.</i>

839
00:52:58,551 --> 00:53:01,220
<i>Six-alpha-niner, are you running on time?</i>

840
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:04,849
Copy, central.
Six-alpha-niner on schedule.

841
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,520
- I got a visual.
- Green light, green light.

842
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:15,401
Oh, that's him.

843
00:53:19,155 --> 00:53:21,199
Okay. I got eyes on the convoy.

844
00:53:21,366 --> 00:53:22,784
Pulling in behind the caboose.

845
00:53:24,577 --> 00:53:25,620
<i>Deploy anchors.</i>

846
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:37,757
Dropping down.

847
00:53:40,343 --> 00:53:42,261
No outgoing distress signals.
You're clear.

848
00:53:44,222 --> 00:53:47,517
Hey. Looks like they got
some good stuff here.

849
00:53:56,109 --> 00:53:58,820
Cool. It's like some kind
of matter phase shifter.

850
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:05,368
All right, coming up.

851
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:12,834
Hey, Big Bird.
This doesn't belong to you.

852
00:54:14,127 --> 00:54:15,628
Oh, God.

853
00:54:22,427 --> 00:54:24,929
- Suit lady, what was that?!
- <i>You told me to choose.</i>

854
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:28,474
What? No, just set everything
back to normal.

855
00:54:28,975 --> 00:54:30,893
<i>Activating all systems.</i>

856
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:48,828
My head.

857
00:54:48,995 --> 00:54:51,789
<i>You appear to have a mild concussion.</i>

858
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,170
Hey, so where am I right now?

859
00:54:57,336 --> 00:54:58,463
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

860
00:54:59,005 --> 00:55:01,174
<i>The container walls are
hindering my sensors.</i>

861
00:55:02,842 --> 00:55:04,218
Wait a minute.

862
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:07,930
They must have hijacked the truck
and taken me to their evil lair.

863
00:55:08,431 --> 00:55:11,851
Okay, suit lady, we're gonna have
to fight our way out of this one.

864
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:14,270
Three, two, one.

865
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:22,528
What is this place?

866
00:55:22,695 --> 00:55:23,946
Suit lady, where am I?

867
00:55:24,113 --> 00:55:26,908
<i>You're in the most secure
facility on the eastern seaboard.</i>

868
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:28,784
<i>The Damage Control deep storage vault.</i>

869
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:31,454
No. Seriously?

870
00:55:34,499 --> 00:55:36,792
<i>The door will most likely
remain closed until morning.</i>

871
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,252
Morning?

872
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:43,508
Hey, suit lady. I kind of feel bad
calling you "suit lady," you know?

873
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:45,968
I think I should probably give you a name.

874
00:55:46,135 --> 00:55:48,471
Like Liz. No, no, no.

875
00:55:48,638 --> 00:55:50,640
God, that's... That's weird.

876
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:53,184
What about Karen?

877
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:55,436
<i>You can call me Karen if you would like.</i>

878
00:55:55,603 --> 00:55:58,731
Hey, Karen, what else can this suit do?

879
00:55:59,649 --> 00:56:00,816
What?

880
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:02,902
Maybe we should run
that refresher course.

881
00:56:03,069 --> 00:56:05,238
- <i>Ricochet web.</i>
- Ricochet web.

882
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:08,282
- Cool.
- <i>Splitter web.</i>

883
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:12,328
- <i>Web grenade.</i>
- Web grenade!

884
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,749
Should I tell Liz that I'm Spider-Man?

885
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:17,959
<i>Who is Liz?</i>

886
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,795
Who's Liz? She's...

887
00:56:20,962 --> 00:56:22,421
She's the best. She's awesome.

888
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:25,299
She's just a girl who goes to my school.

889
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:26,509
And...

890
00:56:26,676 --> 00:56:30,596
Yeah, I just... I really want to tell her,
but it's kind of weird, you know?

891
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:33,975
"Hey, I'm Spider-Man."

892
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:35,268
<i>What's weird about that?</i>

893
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:37,478
What if she's expecting
someone like Tony Stark?

894
00:56:37,645 --> 00:56:39,647
Imagine how disappointed
she'd be when she sees me.

895
00:56:39,814 --> 00:56:43,359
<i>Well, if I were her,
I wouldn't be disappointed at all.</i>

896
00:56:43,526 --> 00:56:45,027
Thanks, Karen.

897
00:56:45,194 --> 00:56:47,947
It's really nice to have
somebody to talk to.

898
00:56:48,114 --> 00:56:49,949
Hey, how long we been here anyways?

899
00:56:50,116 --> 00:56:51,993
- <i>Thirty-seven minutes.</i>
- What?!

900
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:53,869
Thirty-seven minutes? That's insane.

901
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:57,707
I cannot take this anymore.
I got to... I gotta get out of here.

902
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:02,461
There's got to be something
in here I can use.

903
00:57:03,504 --> 00:57:05,256
Okay, let's see.

904
00:57:05,423 --> 00:57:06,966
Nope.

905
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:09,343
That's awesome.

906
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:12,430
Hey, it's like the glowy thing.

907
00:57:12,597 --> 00:57:15,600
<i>That glowy thing is an explosive
Chitauri energy core.</i>

908
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,768
You mean, we've been
carrying around a bomb?

909
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:21,647
<i>It would require radiation
to transform it into an explosive state.</i>

910
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:24,483
No, no, no.

911
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:31,240
Hey! Please!
Please, somebody let me out! Hey!

912
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:33,326
Karen, you have to help me
override that time lock.

913
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:36,078
Okay, Karen, lower the voltage and run it.

914
00:57:36,245 --> 00:57:37,747
<i>Trial unsuccessful.</i>

915
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:40,583
Okay, we're just gonna have
to try every sequence.

916
00:57:43,169 --> 00:57:46,297
Ned, Peter, we're gonna be late.
Come on, let's go.

917
00:57:46,464 --> 00:57:48,758
Okay. Hold on, hold on.

918
00:57:52,553 --> 00:57:55,640
<i>Initiating trial 247.</i>

919
00:57:56,182 --> 00:57:57,558
It worked. It works.

920
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:13,616
Please be sure all cell phones are turned off.

921
00:58:13,783 --> 00:58:14,825
Thank you.

922
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:16,869
Karen, get me to decathlon
as fast as possible.

923
00:58:17,036 --> 00:58:18,162
<i>Sure thing. Just tell me where it is.</i>

924
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:19,997
Across the street from
the Washington Monument.

925
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:23,125
- <i>It's Ned. Leave a message.</i>
- Call me back. The glowy thing's a bomb!

926
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:31,092
<i>There's a vehicle approaching on your right.</i>

927
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:33,469
We have now entered sudden death.

928
00:58:33,636 --> 00:58:36,430
The next correct answer
wins the championship.

929
00:58:40,768 --> 00:58:42,687
Midtown Tech?

930
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:44,480
Zero.

931
00:58:44,647 --> 00:58:45,690
That is correct.

932
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,734
Midtown takes the championship.

933
00:58:50,236 --> 00:58:52,238
- We won.
- You guys, I am so proud of you.

934
00:58:52,405 --> 00:58:55,574
- Told you we didn't need Peter.
- Flash, you didn't answer a question.

935
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:58,703
- Taking it all in, Michelle?
- Oh, yeah, I just...

936
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:01,205
I don't want to celebrate something
that was built by slaves.

937
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:03,833
I'm sure the Washington
Monument wasn't built by...

938
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:08,337
Okay.

939
00:59:08,796 --> 00:59:10,965
- Enjoy your book.
- Thanks.

940
00:59:13,509 --> 00:59:16,011
- Oh, Ned, you're alive.
- Peter, are you okay?

941
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:17,763
Where's the glowy thing?
The glowy thing?

942
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:21,517
- It's safe. It's in my backpack.
- Ned, listen, the glowy thing is dangerous.

943
00:59:21,684 --> 00:59:23,269
You missed the decathlon.
I covered for you.

944
00:59:23,436 --> 00:59:25,354
- Listen.
- We're at the Washington Monument.

945
00:59:25,521 --> 00:59:26,897
- Peter, is that you?
- Hey, Liz.

946
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:28,482
- <i>Is that Liz?</i>
- Put Ned back on the phone.

947
00:59:28,649 --> 00:59:31,777
- <i>You should tell her how you feel.</i>
- You flake. You are lucky we won.

948
00:59:31,944 --> 00:59:35,531
I want to be mad, but I'm more worried.
Like, what is going on with you?

949
00:59:35,698 --> 00:59:37,199
I have to talk to Ned. It's important.

950
00:59:37,366 --> 00:59:39,618
- All items on the belt, please.
- <i>There's something in Ned's backpack.</i>

951
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:41,871
<i>It's dangerous.
Don't let it go through x-ray.</i>

952
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:46,959
Liz? Liz! Damn it.

953
00:59:50,463 --> 00:59:52,757
Can I be the one to tell Peter he's expelled?

954
00:59:56,969 --> 01:00:02,725
The Washington Monument is 555 feet,
five and one-eighth inches tall.

955
01:00:04,477 --> 01:00:07,480
Notice how the marble and granite
are cut around the stone.

956
01:00:14,904 --> 01:00:17,323
No, no, no.
Karen, what's going on up there?

957
01:00:18,324 --> 01:00:19,825
<i>The Chitauri core has detonated...</i>

958
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:21,994
<i>...and caused severe structural
damage to the elevator.</i>

959
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:23,370
- Oh, no.
- My friends are up there.

960
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:26,081
What? Don't worry, ma'am,
everything's gonna be okay.

961
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:28,334
Excuse me, excuse me.
Oh, my God, that's tall.

962
01:00:34,423 --> 01:00:35,925
Oh, my God. Look at the ceiling.

963
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:37,593
Just stay calm, everyone.

964
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,428
Oh, we are all going to die here.

965
01:00:42,056 --> 01:00:44,725
<i>Estimating 10 minutes
before catastrophic failure.</i>

966
01:00:44,892 --> 01:00:46,393
We're freaking screwed.

967
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,688
Okay, I know that was scary,
but our safety systems are working.

968
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:52,274
<i>The safety systems are completely failing.</i>

969
01:00:52,441 --> 01:00:54,109
We're very safe in here.

970
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:56,862
<i>The occupants are
in imminent mortal danger.</i>

971
01:00:57,029 --> 01:00:58,113
Going as fast as I can!

972
01:01:07,832 --> 01:01:09,166
- Let's go.
- Give me your hand.

973
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:12,878
<i>You now have 125 seconds
until catastrophic failure.</i>

974
01:01:13,045 --> 01:01:14,088
What?! Why?

975
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:17,591
<i>Unexpected motion has caused
the deterioration to escalate.</i>

976
01:01:17,758 --> 01:01:21,220
- How do I get in there?
- <i>Activating reconnaissance drone.</i>

977
01:01:23,848 --> 01:01:25,975
Has that been there this whole time?
That's awesome.

978
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:28,686
<i>Locating optimal entry point.</i>

979
01:01:30,396 --> 01:01:32,064
<i>Proceed to southwest window.</i>

980
01:01:32,231 --> 01:01:33,983
Karen, I'm on my way.

981
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:40,531
- There's a lot of glass here.
- You got this.

982
01:01:40,698 --> 01:01:41,907
Keep coming, keep coming.

983
01:01:55,963 --> 01:01:57,965
Okay. Oh, my God.

984
01:01:58,132 --> 01:01:59,800
Okay.

985
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:03,512
<i>What's wrong?
You've reached the southwest window.</i>

986
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:05,431
- <i>Why are you hesitating?</i>
- It's fine.

987
01:02:05,598 --> 01:02:07,308
I've just never been this high before.

988
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:09,643
<i>You have also not reinstalled
your parachute...</i>

989
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:12,521
<i>...so a fall from this height
would most likely be lethal.</i>

990
01:02:14,148 --> 01:02:15,608
Perfect.

991
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:17,359
Oh, my God.

992
01:02:18,903 --> 01:02:20,029
Why is it not breaking?

993
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:23,866
<i>It's four-inch ballistic glass.
You'll have to create more momentum.</i>

994
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:45,429
This is D.C. Metro Police.
Identify yourself.

995
01:02:45,596 --> 01:02:47,181
My friends are in there! Stop!

996
01:02:47,348 --> 01:02:49,099
Return to the ground immediately.

997
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:51,268
- Okay, who's next?
- Me, it's my turn.

998
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:53,270
Flash, seriously? What are you doing?

999
01:02:53,437 --> 01:02:56,398
- Come on.
- Don't worry about the trophy.

1000
01:03:03,864 --> 01:03:05,032
Stand down!

1001
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:07,952
Return to the ground immediately.

1002
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:14,124
Return to the ground or we will open fire!

1003
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,126
Go up, go up.

1004
01:03:16,961 --> 01:03:18,337
I got this.

1005
01:03:18,504 --> 01:03:20,172
Take my trophy.

1006
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:24,218
This is your last chance.

1007
01:03:24,385 --> 01:03:26,428
I'm gonna die.

1008
01:03:35,187 --> 01:03:36,146
Break!

1009
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:51,996
I did it.

1010
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:07,553
Hey, how you doing?
Don't worry. I got you.

1011
01:04:08,012 --> 01:04:10,556
- Yes! Yes.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1012
01:04:10,723 --> 01:04:12,808
- Big guy, quit moving around.
- I'm sorry, sir.

1013
01:04:16,437 --> 01:04:17,479
Let's go, let's go!

1014
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,403
Okay, okay.

1015
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:26,530
- Mr. Harrington, go.
- Ned, come on.

1016
01:04:26,697 --> 01:04:28,490
- This is your stop.
- Come on, Liz.

1017
01:04:28,657 --> 01:04:31,577
Go, go, go. Everybody out.
Move it, people. Move it, move it.

1018
01:04:31,744 --> 01:04:33,245
- Are you sure it's safe?
- Liz.

1019
01:04:34,163 --> 01:04:35,372
Liz!

1020
01:04:39,585 --> 01:04:41,253
You're okay. You're okay.

1021
01:04:44,757 --> 01:04:46,133
Okay.

1022
01:04:46,675 --> 01:04:47,968
- Oh, my God.
- Good, good.

1023
01:04:48,135 --> 01:04:50,012
Come on up.
Come on, you guys, stay back.

1024
01:04:50,179 --> 01:04:52,181
- Come on in.
- You guys good?

1025
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:53,724
So is everyone okay?

1026
01:04:55,184 --> 01:04:57,186
<i>This is your chance, Peter.</i>

1027
01:04:57,352 --> 01:04:59,188
<i>Kiss her.</i>

1028
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:04,610
Thank you.

1029
01:05:07,613 --> 01:05:10,157
Are you really friends with Peter Parker?

1030
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:22,002
I can finish the next order, but without
any new materials from that truck...

1031
01:05:22,586 --> 01:05:24,755
Yeah, damn it.

1032
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,466
We still have enough to do
the Gargan deal though, right?

1033
01:05:27,633 --> 01:05:29,635
Yeah, but then that's it.

1034
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:35,849
Maybe it is time that I built
the high-altitude seal.

1035
01:05:36,016 --> 01:05:37,601
- Would you shut up about that?
- It's only one job.

1036
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:39,269
No.

1037
01:05:40,771 --> 01:05:44,024
Eight years, not a word from
the feds, nothing from those...

1038
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:48,237
...Halloween-costume-wearing
bozos up there in Stark Tower.

1039
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:53,117
And then all of a sudden, this
little bastard in red tights shows up.

1040
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:56,954
And he thinks he can tear
down everything I've built.

1041
01:05:58,455 --> 01:05:59,998
Really?

1042
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:02,334
I'm gonna kill him.

1043
01:06:02,501 --> 01:06:04,545
- I'm gonna find him...
- Found him.

1044
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:06,004
<i>The Spider-Man swooped in...</i>

1045
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:09,091
<i>...heroically saving an Academic
Decathlon team from Queens.</i>

1046
01:06:09,758 --> 01:06:12,469
<i>The identity of the masked
hero is still unknown.</i>

1047
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:17,474
- Mom.
- Oh, kids. All right.

1048
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:20,144
Peter. Come here, come here, come here.

1049
01:06:24,064 --> 01:06:26,567
<i>This past weekend, Midtown's
Academic Decathlon team...</i>

1050
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:29,695
<i>...defeated the country's best
to win the national championship.</i>

1051
01:06:29,862 --> 01:06:31,530
<i>Later that day, they also defeated death.</i>

1052
01:06:31,697 --> 01:06:34,116
<i>Explosion. Sally scream.
Flash scream. Everybody screaming.</i>

1053
01:06:34,283 --> 01:06:38,078
<i>There were purple lasers and smoke.
It was fucking tight, like a Bon Jovi concert.</i>

1054
01:06:38,245 --> 01:06:41,623
<i>As you know, we made it out alive,
and that's the important thing.</i>

1055
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:44,877
<i>I couldn't bear to lose
a student on a school trip.</i>

1056
01:06:46,128 --> 01:06:47,171
<i>Not again.</i>

1057
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:51,049
<i>Thankfully, no one was seriously
injured thanks to the Spider-Man.</i>

1058
01:06:51,675 --> 01:06:53,468
<i>- Thank you, Spider-Man.
- Thank you, Spider-Man.</i>

1059
01:06:53,635 --> 01:06:56,555
<i>Up next: the Spider-Man mania
is sweeping the school.</i>

1060
01:06:56,722 --> 01:06:59,349
<i>How can you show your spider spirit?</i>

1061
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:05,189
Dude, dude, dude.

1062
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:08,066
What is it like being famous
when nobody knows it's you?

1063
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:09,693
- Crazy, dude.
- It's crazy.

1064
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:11,695
- Should we tell everyone?
- No.

1065
01:07:11,862 --> 01:07:14,656
- Should I tell everyone?
- No, dude. That's not a good idea.

1066
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:18,160
- Okay, come on, we'll be late to class.
- I'm not going to class.

1067
01:07:18,327 --> 01:07:20,078
You're already in trouble
for ditching the decathlon.

1068
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:21,788
Dude, listen, I figured it out.

1069
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:23,874
The wingsuit guy is stealing
from Damage Control.

1070
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:27,044
What he takes from Damage Control,
that's how he builds the weapons.

1071
01:07:27,211 --> 01:07:30,130
- So all I gotta do is catch him.
- But we have a Spanish quiz.

1072
01:07:30,297 --> 01:07:32,507
Ned, I'm probably never
gonna come back here.

1073
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:35,719
Mr. Stark is moving the Avengers upstate...

1074
01:07:35,886 --> 01:07:37,846
- ...so when I bring this guy in...
- Dude.

1075
01:07:38,013 --> 01:07:39,932
You want to be a high school dropout?

1076
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:42,768
I am so far beyond high school right now.

1077
01:07:42,935 --> 01:07:45,646
Parker, my office.

1078
01:07:48,315 --> 01:07:49,942
<i>So...</i>

1079
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:51,610
<i>...you got detention.</i>

1080
01:07:51,777 --> 01:07:53,946
<i>You screwed up.
You know what you did was wrong.</i>

1081
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:56,490
<i>The question is, how are you
gonna make things right?</i>

1082
01:07:56,657 --> 01:07:57,824
<i>Maybe you were trying to be cool.</i>

1083
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:01,203
<i>But take it from a guy
who's been frozen for 65 years...</i>

1084
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:04,498
<i>...the only way to really be
cool is to follow the rules.</i>

1085
01:08:05,499 --> 01:08:08,126
<i>We all know what's right.
We all know what's wrong.</i>

1086
01:08:08,293 --> 01:08:10,837
<i>Next time those turkeys try
to convince you of something...</i>

1087
01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:13,257
- <i>...you know is wrong...</i>
- Where you going? Get back here.

1088
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:15,801
<i>...just think to yourself,
what would Captain America do?</i>

1089
01:08:15,968 --> 01:08:17,761
Why are you here?
You don't have detention.

1090
01:08:17,928 --> 01:08:21,515
Oh, I know. I just like coming
here to sketch people in crisis.

1091
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:26,270
It's you.

1092
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:30,524
<i>So your body's changing.
Believe me, I know how that feels.</i>

1093
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:43,787
May?

1094
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:48,333
Hey, Karen. What's up?

1095
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,294
<i>Hey, Peter. How was your Spanish quiz?</i>

1096
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:51,545
I was wondering if you could help me.

1097
01:08:51,712 --> 01:08:54,214
I'm trying to figure out who the guys
under the bridge were that night...

1098
01:08:54,381 --> 01:08:56,842
...but I can only remember
part of a license plate.

1099
01:08:57,009 --> 01:08:59,803
<i>I can run facial recognition
on the footage of that encounter.</i>

1100
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:01,471
- Footage?
- <i>Yes, Peter.</i>

1101
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:03,515
<i>I record everything you see.</i>

1102
01:09:03,682 --> 01:09:04,808
- Everything?
- <i>Everything.</i>

1103
01:09:04,975 --> 01:09:07,311
- All the time?
- <i>It's called the Baby-Monitor Protocol.</i>

1104
01:09:08,103 --> 01:09:10,022
Yeah, of course it is.

1105
01:09:11,231 --> 01:09:14,067
- Yeah, just roll it back to last Friday.
- <i>With pleasure.</i>

1106
01:09:14,234 --> 01:09:16,111
<i>Hey, everyone. Yeah, kick-ass party.</i>

1107
01:09:16,278 --> 01:09:18,864
<i>Hey, what's up, Liz?
Peter's told me a lot about you.</i>

1108
01:09:19,031 --> 01:09:20,991
No, no, no.
This is just me messing around.

1109
01:09:21,158 --> 01:09:22,868
Go later in the day, later in the day.

1110
01:09:23,035 --> 01:09:25,203
<i>It is I, Thor, son of Odin.</i>

1111
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:26,830
No, no, no. That's definitely...

1112
01:09:26,997 --> 01:09:28,582
That's definitely not
what we wanted to watch.

1113
01:09:28,749 --> 01:09:32,252
- <i>Your impressions are very funny.</i>
- Fast-forward to the arms deal.

1114
01:09:32,419 --> 01:09:33,712
Okay.

1115
01:09:33,879 --> 01:09:37,382
- The two on the right, who are they?
- <i>Searching law enforcement databases.</i>

1116
01:09:38,258 --> 01:09:40,260
<i>No records found for two of the individuals.</i>

1117
01:09:40,427 --> 01:09:42,512
- Nothing?
- <i>One individual identified.</i>

1118
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:44,806
<i>Aaron Davis, age 33.</i>

1119
01:09:44,973 --> 01:09:47,809
<i>He has a criminal record
and an address here in Queens.</i>

1120
01:09:47,976 --> 01:09:49,227
Let's pay him a visit.

1121
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:52,731
<i>Would you like me to activate
the Enhanced Interrogation Protocol?</i>

1122
01:09:52,898 --> 01:09:53,982
Yeah.

1123
01:10:09,206 --> 01:10:10,957
- Remember me?
- Hey...

1124
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:12,959
I need information.
You'll give it to me now.

1125
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:14,836
- All right, chill.
- Come on!

1126
01:10:15,587 --> 01:10:18,215
- What happened to your voice?
- What do you mean?

1127
01:10:18,382 --> 01:10:20,467
I heard you by the bridge.
I know what a girl sound like.

1128
01:10:20,634 --> 01:10:23,595
I'm not a girl. I'm a boy.
I mean, I'm a... I'm a man.

1129
01:10:23,762 --> 01:10:25,597
I don't care what you are, a boy, a girl...

1130
01:10:25,764 --> 01:10:27,432
I'm not a girl. I'm a man.

1131
01:10:27,599 --> 01:10:29,935
Come on, man.
Look, who is selling these weapons?

1132
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:32,396
I need to know. Give me names or else.

1133
01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:40,362
- You ain't ever done this before, huh?
- Deactivate Interrogation Mode.

1134
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:42,781
Look, man.

1135
01:10:43,448 --> 01:10:46,159
These guys are selling weapons
that are crazy dangerous.

1136
01:10:46,326 --> 01:10:47,744
They can't be out on the streets.

1137
01:10:47,911 --> 01:10:50,080
If one of them can cut
Delmar's Bodega in half...

1138
01:10:50,247 --> 01:10:52,833
- You know Delmar's?
- Yeah, best sandwich in Queens.

1139
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:55,210
- Sub Haven's pretty good.
- It's too much bread.

1140
01:10:55,377 --> 01:10:57,504
- I like bread.
- Come on, man, please.

1141
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,551
Stupid Interrogation Mode.
Karen, don't ever do that again.

1142
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:06,179
The other night, you told that dude,
"If you shoot somebody, shoot me."

1143
01:11:06,346 --> 01:11:07,806
That's pretty ballsy.

1144
01:11:07,973 --> 01:11:10,016
I don't want those weapons
in this neighborhood.

1145
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:11,560
I got a nephew who live here.

1146
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,020
Who are these guys?

1147
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:16,106
What can you tell me about
the guy with the wings?

1148
01:11:16,273 --> 01:11:18,525
Other than he's a psychopath
dressed like a demon, nothing.

1149
01:11:18,692 --> 01:11:20,652
I don't know who he is or where he is.

1150
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:27,117
- I do know where he's gonna be.
- Really?

1151
01:11:27,284 --> 01:11:29,536
Yeah, this crazy dude I used to work with...

1152
01:11:29,703 --> 01:11:32,122
...he's supposed to be doing a deal with him.

1153
01:11:32,289 --> 01:11:33,915
Yes! Yes.

1154
01:11:34,082 --> 01:11:35,667
- Thank...
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

1155
01:11:35,834 --> 01:11:38,128
I didn't tell you where.
You don't have a location.

1156
01:11:38,295 --> 01:11:40,797
Right, of course.
Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just...

1157
01:11:40,964 --> 01:11:42,215
Yeah.

1158
01:11:42,382 --> 01:11:44,551
- Where is it?
- Can I give you some advice?

1159
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:47,762
You got to get better
at this part of the job.

1160
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:49,389
I don't understand.

1161
01:11:49,556 --> 01:11:50,932
I'm intimidating.

1162
01:11:51,099 --> 01:11:53,977
- Staten Island Ferry, 11.
- Oh, that's soon.

1163
01:11:54,144 --> 01:11:55,854
That's gonna dissolve in two hours.

1164
01:11:56,021 --> 01:11:58,607
No, no, no. Come fix this.

1165
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:00,442
- Two hours. You deserve that.
- I got ice cream in here.

1166
01:12:00,609 --> 01:12:03,195
You deserve that. You're a criminal.
Bye, Mr. Criminal.

1167
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:19,127
Nice.

1168
01:12:22,422 --> 01:12:25,050
Okay, Karen, activate
Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.

1169
01:12:25,217 --> 01:12:26,259
<i>Sure thing.</i>

1170
01:12:26,635 --> 01:12:28,762
He's up front, main deck.

1171
01:12:28,929 --> 01:12:30,347
I hate this guy.

1172
01:12:30,514 --> 01:12:32,849
It's the guy from the bridge, right?
Who's that other guy?

1173
01:12:33,016 --> 01:12:34,643
Just keep me posted.

1174
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:36,686
<i>There's no record of him
in my criminal database.</i>

1175
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:39,523
<i>Incoming call from May Parker.
Should I reroute to your heads-up display?</i>

1176
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:42,108
I can't talk right now.
I'll call her back.

1177
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:47,364
Hey, dronie, keep an eye on that guy.
We can't let anybody get away this time.

1178
01:12:55,622 --> 01:12:57,707
- Who's the guy on the left?
- <i>Mac Gargan.</i>

1179
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,293
<i>Extensive criminal record, including homicide.</i>

1180
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:02,295
<i>Would you like me to activate Instant Kill?</i>

1181
01:13:02,462 --> 01:13:05,882
No, Karen, stop it
with the Instant Kill already.

1182
01:13:07,092 --> 01:13:09,386
White pickup truck.

1183
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:16,017
Dronie, scan the ship
for a white pickup truck.

1184
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:38,164
Oh, this is too perfect.

1185
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:40,667
I got the weapons, buyers
and sellers in one place.

1186
01:13:40,834 --> 01:13:43,795
- <i>Incoming call from Tony Stark.</i>
- No, no, no.

1187
01:13:43,962 --> 01:13:46,131
- Don't answer.
- <i>Mr. Parker. Got a sec?</i>

1188
01:13:46,298 --> 01:13:48,717
- I'm actually at school.
- <i>No, you're not.</i>

1189
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:50,760
- <i>Nice work in D.C.</i>
- Okay.

1190
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:53,638
<i>My dad never really
gave me a lot of support...</i>

1191
01:13:53,805 --> 01:13:55,974
<i>...and I'm trying to break
the cycle of shame.</i>

1192
01:13:56,141 --> 01:13:57,309
I'm in the middle of something.

1193
01:13:57,475 --> 01:13:58,852
<i>Don't cut me off when
I'm complimenting you.</i>

1194
01:13:59,019 --> 01:14:02,147
<i>Anyway, great things are about to...
What is that?</i>

1195
01:14:03,106 --> 01:14:04,774
I'm at band practice.

1196
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:09,613
<i>That's odd. Happy told me you quit
band six weeks ago. What's up?</i>

1197
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:11,990
- I gotta go. End call.
- <i>Hey.</i>

1198
01:14:12,157 --> 01:14:13,283
I'll take those!

1199
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:20,248
Hey, guys. The illegal weapons-deal
ferry was at 10:30. You missed it.

1200
01:14:29,257 --> 01:14:30,884
<i>Spider guy's here.</i>

1201
01:14:34,054 --> 01:14:36,056
Not so fast.

1202
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:40,185
Are you guys okay?
My bad. That was a little hard.

1203
01:14:40,727 --> 01:14:43,897
I got to say, the other guy
was way better with that thing.

1204
01:14:44,356 --> 01:14:45,565
I'm honestly...

1205
01:14:45,732 --> 01:14:47,692
I'm... I'm shocked.

1206
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:01,706
- Freeze! FBI.
- Don't move.

1207
01:15:01,873 --> 01:15:03,667
- Get on the ground.
- FBI.

1208
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:04,876
What do you mean, FBI?

1209
01:15:05,043 --> 01:15:08,463
- <i>The Federal Bureau of Investigation.</i>
- I know, but what are they doing here?

1210
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:18,515
Get out of the way. Get out of the way!

1211
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:20,809
No.

1212
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:25,522
Look out, look out, look out.
Move, move, move!

1213
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:32,529
- Move.
- Get to the top deck.

1214
01:15:32,696 --> 01:15:34,239
We're getting out of here.

1215
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:15,405
Activate Taser web!

1216
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:29,878
You're messing with things
you don't understand.

1217
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:11,044
Oh, my God. What do I do? Karen...

1218
01:17:11,211 --> 01:17:14,464
...give me an x-ray of the boat
and target all the strongest points.

1219
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,344
Web grenade. Web grenade.

1220
01:17:21,179 --> 01:17:23,389
Splitter web, go.

1221
01:17:51,459 --> 01:17:54,587
<i>Great job, Peter.
You are 98 percent successful.</i>

1222
01:17:54,754 --> 01:17:58,007
- Ninety-eight?
- Yeah, Spider-Man!

1223
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:01,761
No, no, no.

1224
01:18:36,379 --> 01:18:38,006
What the hell?

1225
01:18:41,426 --> 01:18:43,303
What the hell?

1226
01:18:45,096 --> 01:18:46,806
<i>Hi, Spider-Man.</i>

1227
01:18:46,973 --> 01:18:49,350
<i>Band practice, was it?</i>

1228
01:19:10,997 --> 01:19:13,207
Yeah, Iron Man!

1229
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:22,383
Mr. Stark.

1230
01:19:23,927 --> 01:19:27,388
Hey, Mr. Stark, could I do anything?
What do you want me to do?

1231
01:19:28,181 --> 01:19:30,433
<i>I think you've done enough.</i>

1232
01:19:44,572 --> 01:19:47,825
So that's it. You're just gonna run?

1233
01:19:50,203 --> 01:19:52,664
Feds were waiting for us.

1234
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:55,500
Now we're on Iron Man's radar?

1235
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:57,919
Yeah, I'm running.

1236
01:19:58,711 --> 01:19:59,879
You should too.

1237
01:20:00,421 --> 01:20:02,256
You know I can't do that.

1238
01:20:02,423 --> 01:20:03,633
So now what?

1239
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:08,763
Mason, can you get that high-altitude
seal thing up and running in time?

1240
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:10,932
Seriously?

1241
01:20:11,099 --> 01:20:13,267
Yes. You will not regret this.

1242
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:18,231
You in?

1243
01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:30,952
<i>Previously on</i> Peter Screws the Pooch...

1244
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:32,829
<i>...I tell you to stay away from this.</i>

1245
01:20:32,996 --> 01:20:35,623
<i>Instead, you hacked
a multimillion-dollar suit...</i>

1246
01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:38,042
<i>...so you could sneak
around behind my back...</i>

1247
01:20:38,209 --> 01:20:41,045
<i>...doing the one thing
I told you not to do.</i>

1248
01:20:41,212 --> 01:20:42,213
Is everyone okay?

1249
01:20:43,089 --> 01:20:45,591
<i>No thanks to you.</i>

1250
01:20:46,384 --> 01:20:48,386
No thanks to me?

1251
01:20:49,929 --> 01:20:52,557
Those weapons were out there,
and I tried to tell you about it...

1252
01:20:52,724 --> 01:20:54,100
...but you didn't listen.

1253
01:20:54,267 --> 01:20:57,687
None of this would've happened
if you had just listened to me.

1254
01:20:57,854 --> 01:20:59,897
If you even cared,
you'd actually be here.

1255
01:21:04,444 --> 01:21:07,530
I did listen, kid.
Who do you think called the FBI, huh?

1256
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:10,283
Do you know I was the only
one who believed in you?

1257
01:21:10,450 --> 01:21:14,245
Everyone else said I was crazy
to recruit a 14-year-old kid.

1258
01:21:14,412 --> 01:21:16,706
- I'm 15.
- No, this is where you zip it, all right?

1259
01:21:16,873 --> 01:21:19,459
The adult is talking.
What if somebody had died tonight?

1260
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:22,712
Different story, right?
Because that's on you.

1261
01:21:22,879 --> 01:21:24,213
And if you died...

1262
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:26,591
...I feel like that's on me.

1263
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:28,801
- I don't need that on my conscience.
- Yes, sir.

1264
01:21:28,968 --> 01:21:31,596
- I'm sorry. I understand.
- Sorry doesn't cut it.

1265
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:34,140
I just wanted to be like you.

1266
01:21:34,307 --> 01:21:35,850
And I wanted you to be better.

1267
01:21:37,602 --> 01:21:39,979
It's not working out.
I'm gonna need the suit back.

1268
01:21:40,146 --> 01:21:42,356
- For how long?
- Forever.

1269
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:44,567
- Yeah, that's how it works.
- No, no. Please.

1270
01:21:44,734 --> 01:21:46,652
- Let's have it.
- Please, this is all I have.

1271
01:21:46,819 --> 01:21:48,196
I'm nothing without this suit.

1272
01:21:48,946 --> 01:21:51,365
If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it.

1273
01:21:51,532 --> 01:21:52,700
Okay?

1274
01:21:52,867 --> 01:21:55,078
God, I sound like my dad.

1275
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:58,998
I don't have any other clothes.

1276
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:01,667
Okay, we'll sort that out.

1277
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:13,221
Hey.

1278
01:22:18,017 --> 01:22:21,354
I've been calling you all day.
You didn't answer your phone.

1279
01:22:21,521 --> 01:22:22,980
You can't do that.

1280
01:22:23,147 --> 01:22:25,775
Then this ferry thing happens.

1281
01:22:25,942 --> 01:22:28,611
I've called five police stations.

1282
01:22:28,778 --> 01:22:29,987
Five.

1283
01:22:30,154 --> 01:22:31,948
I called five of your friends.
I called Ned's mother.

1284
01:22:32,115 --> 01:22:35,743
I'm fine. May, I'm okay.
Honestly, just relax. I'm fine.

1285
01:22:36,661 --> 01:22:37,703
Cut the bullshit.

1286
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:39,539
I know you left detention.

1287
01:22:39,705 --> 01:22:42,208
I know you left the hotel room
in Washington.

1288
01:22:42,375 --> 01:22:44,293
I know you sneak out of this
house every night.

1289
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,753
That's not fine.

1290
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:49,549
Peter, you have to tell me what's going on.
Just lay it out.

1291
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:50,758
It's just me and you.

1292
01:22:52,635 --> 01:22:54,262
I lost the Stark internship.

1293
01:22:54,846 --> 01:22:56,430
- What?
- Yeah.

1294
01:22:56,889 --> 01:22:58,015
What happened?

1295
01:22:58,558 --> 01:23:02,645
I just thought that I could work really hard
and he could... He would... You know.

1296
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:05,940
But I screwed it up.

1297
01:23:06,107 --> 01:23:07,900
It's okay, it's okay.

1298
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:11,237
It's okay.

1299
01:23:12,113 --> 01:23:14,532
I'm sorry I made you worry.

1300
01:23:14,699 --> 01:23:16,534
I'm not trying to ruin your life.

1301
01:23:16,701 --> 01:23:17,994
Yeah, I know.

1302
01:23:18,161 --> 01:23:19,453
Just...

1303
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:21,998
- I used to sneak out too.
- Yeah.

1304
01:23:25,001 --> 01:23:27,170
And take a shower. You smell.

1305
01:23:27,837 --> 01:23:30,214
You smell like garbage.

1306
01:23:30,381 --> 01:23:32,008
I know.

1307
01:23:35,052 --> 01:23:37,388
Peter, you're a good kid
and you're a smart kid...

1308
01:23:37,555 --> 01:23:40,183
...so just try to keep your head straight, okay?

1309
01:23:40,808 --> 01:23:42,268
Okay.

1310
01:23:42,435 --> 01:23:44,270
All right, get out of here.

1311
01:23:52,153 --> 01:23:53,279
Are you expelled?

1312
01:23:53,446 --> 01:23:56,449
Do you have to go to that high school
where the principal has a crossbow?

1313
01:23:56,616 --> 01:23:59,952
Pretty sure that's an urban myth,
and, no, I'm not expelled.

1314
01:24:00,494 --> 01:24:02,788
You're so lucky.

1315
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,296
Hey.

1316
01:24:52,463 --> 01:24:55,591
- Hey.
- I thought you had calculus fifth period.

1317
01:24:55,758 --> 01:24:58,135
Yeah, I was just doing
some homecoming stuff.

1318
01:24:58,302 --> 01:25:00,012
Hey, look, I...

1319
01:25:00,888 --> 01:25:03,599
I just wanted to apologize about
the whole decathlon thing.

1320
01:25:03,766 --> 01:25:04,850
It's fine.

1321
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:09,063
Last week, decathlon was the most
important thing, but then I almost died.

1322
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:11,148
No, I'm...

1323
01:25:11,315 --> 01:25:13,317
I just mean that...

1324
01:25:13,818 --> 01:25:16,362
...it was not cool, especially...

1325
01:25:18,114 --> 01:25:19,865
...because...

1326
01:25:21,117 --> 01:25:23,703
...I like you.

1327
01:25:24,203 --> 01:25:25,705
I know.

1328
01:25:28,332 --> 01:25:29,375
You do?

1329
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:32,169
You're terrible at keeping secrets.

1330
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:34,005
Yeah, you'd be surprised.

1331
01:25:37,383 --> 01:25:39,677
I got to get to class, but...

1332
01:25:40,094 --> 01:25:44,265
I'd say we should hang out,
but I'm gonna be in detention...

1333
01:25:44,432 --> 01:25:47,435
...forever, but...

1334
01:25:47,601 --> 01:25:49,937
I guess you already have
a date to homecoming.

1335
01:25:50,104 --> 01:25:54,817
Actually, I was so busy planning it,
I never really got around to that part, so...

1336
01:25:56,027 --> 01:25:57,737
Do you want to...

1337
01:25:57,903 --> 01:25:58,946
...go with me?

1338
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:01,741
Yeah. Sure.

1339
01:26:01,907 --> 01:26:04,535
Really? I mean, great. Cool.

1340
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:06,329
Cool.

1341
01:26:06,829 --> 01:26:09,415
I'm actually going that way.

1342
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:22,470
May, I need your help.

1343
01:26:38,903 --> 01:26:40,738
Through or around?

1344
01:26:45,743 --> 01:26:46,994
Right?

1345
01:26:57,338 --> 01:26:59,590
It's game day. So, what's the plan?

1346
01:26:59,757 --> 01:27:01,300
Open the door for her.

1347
01:27:01,467 --> 01:27:03,886
Tell her she looks nice, but not
too much because that's creepy.

1348
01:27:04,053 --> 01:27:05,137
- Don't be creepy.
- No.

1349
01:27:05,304 --> 01:27:07,973
When I dance with her,
I'm putting my hands on her hips.

1350
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:09,892
I got this.

1351
01:27:12,311 --> 01:27:13,354
- Love you.
- Bye.

1352
01:27:28,244 --> 01:27:29,870
You must be Peter.

1353
01:27:30,704 --> 01:27:31,831
Yeah.

1354
01:27:31,997 --> 01:27:33,541
I'm Liz's dad.

1355
01:27:33,707 --> 01:27:35,209
Put her there.

1356
01:27:35,793 --> 01:27:37,336
Hell of a grip.

1357
01:27:37,503 --> 01:27:39,797
Come on in here. Come on.

1358
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:04,572
Hi, Peter.

1359
01:28:05,239 --> 01:28:06,824
You look very handsome.

1360
01:28:06,991 --> 01:28:08,492
Thank you.

1361
01:28:08,659 --> 01:28:10,786
You got his name right?

1362
01:28:10,953 --> 01:28:12,329
- Freddie?
- Peter.

1363
01:28:12,496 --> 01:28:13,706
Peter. Peter.

1364
01:28:14,707 --> 01:28:15,833
I'm gonna go get Liz.

1365
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:17,793
Okay.

1366
01:28:23,757 --> 01:28:24,967
You all right, Pete?

1367
01:28:25,134 --> 01:28:26,260
Yeah.

1368
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:29,013
Because you look pale.

1369
01:28:30,848 --> 01:28:32,308
You want something to drink?

1370
01:28:32,475 --> 01:28:34,727
A bourbon or a Scotch,
or something like that?

1371
01:28:34,894 --> 01:28:36,187
I'm not old enough to drink.

1372
01:28:36,729 --> 01:28:38,147
That's the right answer.

1373
01:28:42,610 --> 01:28:45,362
- Do you look beautiful.
- Please don't embarrass me, Dad.

1374
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:46,947
Doesn't she, Pete?

1375
01:28:47,114 --> 01:28:49,492
Yeah, you look really good.

1376
01:28:49,658 --> 01:28:51,869
Once again, that's the right answer.

1377
01:28:52,036 --> 01:28:54,079
Is that a corsage?

1378
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:57,333
Thanks.

1379
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:00,711
Well, hey, I'm your chauffeur,
so let's get this show on the road.

1380
01:29:00,878 --> 01:29:04,048
No, no, no, we have to take
some pictures, babe. All right.

1381
01:29:04,215 --> 01:29:06,467
- Oh, right here. Perfect.
- Mom.

1382
01:29:06,634 --> 01:29:08,093
Okay. Come on, you guys.

1383
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:10,930
Peter, closer.

1384
01:29:12,181 --> 01:29:13,557
Smile.

1385
01:29:14,517 --> 01:29:16,310
There you go.

1386
01:29:22,107 --> 01:29:25,277
- Sir, you don't have to drive us.
- No, no, it's not a big deal.

1387
01:29:25,444 --> 01:29:27,655
I'm going out of town.
It's right on my way.

1388
01:29:27,821 --> 01:29:29,740
- He's always going. Have fun.
- Last time.

1389
01:29:29,907 --> 01:29:31,283
- Thank you.
- Promise.

1390
01:29:31,450 --> 01:29:32,868
He's cute.

1391
01:29:34,954 --> 01:29:37,540
- See you in a couple of days. All right.
- Bye, baby.

1392
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:39,291
Come on, Pedro.

1393
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:41,377
- Bye, Peter. Have fun.
- Yeah, I will.

1394
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:54,348
- What are you gonna do, Pete?
- What?

1395
01:29:54,807 --> 01:29:56,559
When you graduate,
what do you think you'll do?

1396
01:29:56,725 --> 01:29:59,311
- Oh, I don't know.
- Don't grill him, Dad.

1397
01:30:00,062 --> 01:30:02,064
Just saying, you know.

1398
01:30:02,231 --> 01:30:03,983
All you guys who go to that school...

1399
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:06,569
...you pretty much have
your life planned out, right?

1400
01:30:07,111 --> 01:30:09,280
Yeah, no, I'm just a sophomore.

1401
01:30:09,446 --> 01:30:12,866
Peter has an internship with Tony Stark.
I think he doesn't have to worry.

1402
01:30:13,576 --> 01:30:15,327
Really? Stark?

1403
01:30:15,494 --> 01:30:17,204
So cool.

1404
01:30:18,247 --> 01:30:19,415
What do you do?

1405
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:22,793
Yeah, actually, I don't
intern for him anymore.

1406
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,963
- Seriously?
- Yeah, it got...

1407
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:27,172
...boring.

1408
01:30:27,339 --> 01:30:30,301
It was boring? You got
to hang out with Spider-Man.

1409
01:30:30,467 --> 01:30:32,386
Really? Spider-Man?

1410
01:30:34,013 --> 01:30:35,431
What's he like?

1411
01:30:36,515 --> 01:30:38,058
Yeah, he's nice.

1412
01:30:38,225 --> 01:30:40,060
Nice man.

1413
01:30:40,227 --> 01:30:42,062
Solid dude.

1414
01:30:44,982 --> 01:30:47,067
Look. So cute.

1415
01:30:52,448 --> 01:30:54,658
I've seen you around, right?
I mean...

1416
01:30:55,409 --> 01:30:58,537
...somewhere. We've... Have we ever...?
Because even the voice...

1417
01:30:59,330 --> 01:31:01,040
He does Academic Decathlon with me.

1418
01:31:02,041 --> 01:31:03,626
And he was at my party.

1419
01:31:03,792 --> 01:31:06,170
It was a great party, really great, yeah.

1420
01:31:06,337 --> 01:31:10,549
- Beautiful house, a lot of windows.
- You were there for, like, two seconds.

1421
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:14,470
That was... I was there
longer than two seconds.

1422
01:31:14,637 --> 01:31:18,140
- You disappeared.
- No. No, I did not disappear.

1423
01:31:18,307 --> 01:31:22,478
Yes, you did. You disappeared like you
always do, like you did in D.C. too.

1424
01:31:30,069 --> 01:31:33,405
That's terrible what happened
down there in D.C. though.

1425
01:31:33,572 --> 01:31:35,199
Were you scared?

1426
01:31:36,033 --> 01:31:38,535
I'll bet you were glad when
your old pal Spider-Man...

1427
01:31:38,702 --> 01:31:40,788
...showed up in the elevator though, huh?

1428
01:31:43,582 --> 01:31:45,292
Yeah, well, I actually didn't go up.

1429
01:31:45,459 --> 01:31:47,211
I saw it all from the ground.

1430
01:31:48,212 --> 01:31:49,546
Yeah.

1431
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:52,216
Very lucky that he was there that day.

1432
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:57,930
Good old Spider-Man.

1433
01:32:01,517 --> 01:32:03,435
Dad, the light.

1434
01:32:18,826 --> 01:32:21,036
Here we are. End of the line.

1435
01:32:21,203 --> 01:32:22,621
Thanks, Dad.

1436
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:24,623
You head in there, gumdrop.

1437
01:32:24,790 --> 01:32:27,543
I'm gonna give Peter the "dad" talk.

1438
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:31,380
Don't let him intimidate you.

1439
01:32:31,547 --> 01:32:32,756
Love you.

1440
01:32:32,923 --> 01:32:35,384
- Love you, gumdrop.
- Have a safe flight.

1441
01:32:35,551 --> 01:32:36,760
Hi.

1442
01:32:37,803 --> 01:32:40,097
You guys look so pretty.

1443
01:32:44,935 --> 01:32:45,978
Does she know?

1444
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:48,313
Know what?

1445
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,232
So she doesn't. Good.

1446
01:32:50,399 --> 01:32:52,067
Close to the vest.

1447
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:53,402
I admire that.

1448
01:32:53,569 --> 01:32:55,696
I've got a few secrets of my own.

1449
01:32:56,321 --> 01:33:00,159
Of all the reasons I didn't
want my daughter to date...

1450
01:33:02,327 --> 01:33:03,746
Peter...

1451
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:06,123
...nothing is more important than family.

1452
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:08,083
You saved my daughter's life.

1453
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:10,085
I could never forget something like that.

1454
01:33:10,252 --> 01:33:12,004
So I'm gonna give you one chance.

1455
01:33:12,171 --> 01:33:13,297
Are you ready?

1456
01:33:14,006 --> 01:33:17,009
You walk through those doors,
you forget any of this happened...

1457
01:33:17,426 --> 01:33:20,804
...and don't you ever, ever...

1458
01:33:20,971 --> 01:33:23,557
...interfere with my business again.

1459
01:33:23,724 --> 01:33:25,642
Because if you do...

1460
01:33:25,809 --> 01:33:28,061
...I'll kill you...

1461
01:33:28,228 --> 01:33:29,813
...and everybody you love.

1462
01:33:31,064 --> 01:33:32,900
I'll kill you dead.

1463
01:33:33,066 --> 01:33:35,861
That's what I'll do to protect my family.
Do you understand?

1464
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:39,198
Hey.

1465
01:33:40,532 --> 01:33:43,952
I just saved your life.
Now what do you say?

1466
01:33:46,163 --> 01:33:47,498
Thank you.

1467
01:33:47,664 --> 01:33:49,416
You're welcome.

1468
01:33:49,583 --> 01:33:55,130
Now you go on in there and you show
my daughter a good time, okay?

1469
01:33:55,881 --> 01:33:57,758
Just not too good.

1470
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:52,479
Hey.

1471
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:56,358
What did he say to you?

1472
01:35:00,612 --> 01:35:02,030
Gotta go.

1473
01:35:03,949 --> 01:35:05,576
I'm sorry.

1474
01:35:05,951 --> 01:35:07,870
You don't deserve this.

1475
01:35:29,308 --> 01:35:30,642
He gave you a choice.

1476
01:35:30,809 --> 01:35:32,895
- You chose wrong.
- What the hell?

1477
01:35:33,061 --> 01:35:34,730
What's with the crappy costume?

1478
01:35:37,149 --> 01:35:38,358
My web-shooters.

1479
01:35:47,284 --> 01:35:51,872
I wasn't sure about this
thing at first, but damn.

1480
01:35:57,044 --> 01:35:58,420
Gross.

1481
01:36:10,349 --> 01:36:12,851
- Why did he send you here?
- Guess you'll never know.

1482
01:36:17,940 --> 01:36:19,191
Nice shot!

1483
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:25,656
Yes!

1484
01:36:25,822 --> 01:36:27,658
Ned, the guy with the wings is Liz's dad.

1485
01:36:27,824 --> 01:36:29,701
- What?
- I gotta tell Mr. Stark.

1486
01:36:29,868 --> 01:36:32,704
Call Happy Hogan.
He's Mr. Stark's head of security.

1487
01:36:32,871 --> 01:36:34,081
Get a computer and track my phone.

1488
01:36:34,498 --> 01:36:36,249
- Will you be okay?
- Hurry, we gotta catch him...

1489
01:36:36,416 --> 01:36:38,710
...before he leaves town.

1490
01:36:38,877 --> 01:36:41,088
I'm sorry about dinner...

1491
01:36:41,505 --> 01:36:44,800
...but I know when branzino's fresh,
and that was not fresh, okay? So...

1492
01:36:46,259 --> 01:36:47,844
Flash, I need your car and phone.

1493
01:36:48,011 --> 01:36:50,764
Sir, technically, this is my dad's car, sir.
So I can't...

1494
01:36:59,356 --> 01:37:01,274
Hello, Ned?
Hey, hey, can you hear me?

1495
01:37:01,441 --> 01:37:03,443
- Go for Ned.
- <i>Ned, I need you...</i>

1496
01:37:03,777 --> 01:37:05,946
- ...to track my phone.
- Yeah, but where is it?

1497
01:37:10,909 --> 01:37:13,286
Genius move. Okay, he just passed
the GameStop on Jackson Avenue.

1498
01:37:13,453 --> 01:37:16,665
Hey, where are the headlights
on this thing? I'm in Flash's car.

1499
01:37:16,832 --> 01:37:19,167
- I'll pull the specs.
- Okay, you're on speakerphone.

1500
01:37:19,334 --> 01:37:22,295
- You stole Flash's car. Awesome.
- Yeah, it's awesome. It's...

1501
01:37:23,797 --> 01:37:25,841
Get out of the way,
get out of the way! Move!

1502
01:37:26,008 --> 01:37:27,634
- Are you okay?
- <i>I've never driven before...</i>

1503
01:37:27,801 --> 01:37:31,471
...only with May in parking lots.
This is a huge step up.

1504
01:37:33,473 --> 01:37:34,891
<i>Hey, have you gotten
through to Happy yet?</i>

1505
01:37:35,058 --> 01:37:38,395
Yeah. I'm working on it.
I just gotta backdoor the phone system.

1506
01:37:41,815 --> 01:37:43,525
Guy in the chair.

1507
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:50,032
<i>Takeoff in nine minutes.</i>

1508
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:52,367
<i>Hello? Hello? Who is this?</i>

1509
01:37:52,534 --> 01:37:53,577
- Mr. Happy, it's Ned.
- <i>Who?</i>

1510
01:37:53,744 --> 01:37:56,038
I'm an associate of Peter Parker.
Got something very important to tell you...

1511
01:37:56,204 --> 01:37:57,748
<i>You gotta be shitting me.</i>

1512
01:37:58,457 --> 01:37:59,499
Damn.

1513
01:37:59,666 --> 01:38:02,044
Hey, Ned, how we coming on
with those headlights?

1514
01:38:03,628 --> 01:38:06,465
Round knob to the left of the
steering wheel, turn clockwise.

1515
01:38:06,631 --> 01:38:07,924
Left, okay.

1516
01:38:08,091 --> 01:38:09,885
Okay, perfect.
So where's my phone now?

1517
01:38:11,470 --> 01:38:13,055
He stopped in an old industrial
park in Brooklyn.

1518
01:38:13,221 --> 01:38:16,016
What? That makes no sense.
He said he was going out of town.

1519
01:38:16,183 --> 01:38:19,603
Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. Happy.
Don't think he likes you, by the way.

1520
01:38:19,770 --> 01:38:21,438
It sounded like he was catching a flight.

1521
01:38:21,605 --> 01:38:22,731
<i>He said something about
taking off in nine minutes.</i>

1522
01:38:22,898 --> 01:38:24,900
- What?
- He was surrounded by boxes.

1523
01:38:25,067 --> 01:38:26,610
Boxes? It's moving day.

1524
01:38:26,777 --> 01:38:28,737
It's moving day.
He's gonna rob that plane.

1525
01:38:28,904 --> 01:38:30,781
I gotta stop him!

1526
01:38:33,950 --> 01:38:35,744
All right, wheels up in eight minutes.

1527
01:38:35,911 --> 01:38:38,497
We just got to load Tony's
old Hulkbuster Armor...

1528
01:38:38,663 --> 01:38:42,084
...prototype for Cap's new shield,
and the Meging...

1529
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:43,794
The Meg... The...

1530
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:45,128
Thor's magic belt.

1531
01:38:46,463 --> 01:38:49,132
Okay, slow down. You're getting close.
It's on your right.

1532
01:38:49,299 --> 01:38:50,550
- What?
- <i>Turn right.</i>

1533
01:39:00,393 --> 01:39:02,687
- Peter. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1534
01:39:02,854 --> 01:39:05,273
Just keep trying to get through to Happy.

1535
01:39:05,732 --> 01:39:07,901
It's been an honor, Spider-Man.

1536
01:39:08,568 --> 01:39:10,779
What are you doing here?
There's a dance.

1537
01:39:14,574 --> 01:39:15,617
I'm...

1538
01:39:15,784 --> 01:39:17,077
...looking...

1539
01:39:17,244 --> 01:39:19,412
...at porn.

1540
01:39:57,701 --> 01:39:58,743
Hey!

1541
01:40:00,287 --> 01:40:01,663
Surprised?

1542
01:40:01,830 --> 01:40:03,707
Oh, hey, Pete.

1543
01:40:04,416 --> 01:40:05,709
I didn't hear you come in.

1544
01:40:05,876 --> 01:40:07,961
It's over. I've got you.

1545
01:40:08,128 --> 01:40:10,130
You know, I gotta tell you, Pete...

1546
01:40:10,714 --> 01:40:13,633
...I really, really admire your grit.

1547
01:40:15,218 --> 01:40:16,386
I see why Liz likes you.

1548
01:40:18,597 --> 01:40:20,515
I do. When you first came to the house...

1549
01:40:20,682 --> 01:40:23,810
...I wasn't sure. I thought, "Really?"
But I get it now.

1550
01:40:24,644 --> 01:40:26,396
How could you do this to her?

1551
01:40:26,563 --> 01:40:28,565
To her?
I'm not doing anything to her, Pete.

1552
01:40:28,732 --> 01:40:31,067
I'm doing this for her.

1553
01:40:31,568 --> 01:40:32,611
Yeah.

1554
01:40:36,656 --> 01:40:38,116
Peter...

1555
01:40:38,992 --> 01:40:40,035
...you're young.

1556
01:40:40,202 --> 01:40:42,454
You don't understand
how the world works.

1557
01:40:42,621 --> 01:40:45,373
But I understand that selling
weapons to criminals is wrong.

1558
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:48,293
How do you think your buddy
Stark paid for that tower?

1559
01:40:48,460 --> 01:40:49,920
Or any of his little toys?

1560
01:40:50,086 --> 01:40:51,838
Those people, Pete,
those people up there...

1561
01:40:52,005 --> 01:40:54,299
...the rich and the powerful,
they do whatever they want.

1562
01:40:54,466 --> 01:40:56,218
Guys like us...

1563
01:40:56,384 --> 01:40:58,261
...like you and me...

1564
01:40:58,428 --> 01:40:59,888
...they don't care about us.

1565
01:41:00,055 --> 01:41:02,515
We build their roads,
and we fight all their wars...

1566
01:41:02,682 --> 01:41:04,976
...and everything,
but they don't care about us.

1567
01:41:05,143 --> 01:41:09,314
We have to pick up after them.
We have to eat their table scraps.

1568
01:41:10,565 --> 01:41:12,567
That's how it is.

1569
01:41:12,943 --> 01:41:15,028
I know you know what
I'm talking about, Peter.

1570
01:41:15,195 --> 01:41:16,947
Why are you telling me this?

1571
01:41:17,113 --> 01:41:19,574
Because I want you to understand.

1572
01:41:19,741 --> 01:41:21,159
And...

1573
01:41:21,326 --> 01:41:24,329
...I needed a little time to get her airborne.

1574
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:38,343
I'm sorry, Peter.

1575
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:45,475
What are you talking about?
That thing hasn't even touched me yet.

1576
01:41:45,934 --> 01:41:48,186
True. Then again...

1577
01:41:48,353 --> 01:41:50,063
...wasn't really trying to.

1578
01:41:55,819 --> 01:41:57,445
<i>Chief, they're powering up engines.</i>

1579
01:41:57,612 --> 01:42:00,448
- Okay. Yeah, yeah.
- <i>Come on, come on, come on.</i>

1580
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:53,710
Okay, ready?

1581
01:43:02,635 --> 01:43:04,596
Hello?

1582
01:43:06,973 --> 01:43:08,433
Hello!

1583
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:10,185
Please, hey.

1584
01:43:10,602 --> 01:43:12,896
Hey, please. I'm down here.

1585
01:43:13,063 --> 01:43:15,023
I'm down here. I'm stuck.

1586
01:43:15,190 --> 01:43:17,984
I'm stuck. I can't move. I can't...

1587
01:43:34,751 --> 01:43:38,838
<i>If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it.</i>

1588
01:43:44,594 --> 01:43:46,554
Come on, Peter.

1589
01:43:46,721 --> 01:43:48,264
Come on, Spider-Man.

1590
01:43:48,431 --> 01:43:50,392
Come on, Spider-Man.

1591
01:43:50,558 --> 01:43:52,769
Come on, Spider-Man.

1592
01:43:54,646 --> 01:43:57,023
Come on, Spider-Man!

1593
01:44:48,199 --> 01:44:49,701
Launch for intercept.
Green light. Green light.

1594
01:44:50,076 --> 01:44:51,744
Oh, yeah.

1595
01:45:06,634 --> 01:45:08,928
Retroreflective panels engaged.

1596
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:23,860
Got a visual on the plane,
but I'm feeling a little resistance.

1597
01:45:24,027 --> 01:45:26,696
<i>It's probably just drag
on the new turbines.</i>

1598
01:45:39,417 --> 01:45:42,587
<i>Look out for the cloaking cameras.
Stay in the blind spots.</i>

1599
01:45:52,096 --> 01:45:53,848
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1600
01:45:54,182 --> 01:45:56,601
Deploying high-altitude vacuum seal.

1601
01:45:56,768 --> 01:45:58,019
This better work, Mason.

1602
01:46:03,858 --> 01:46:06,903
<i>Trust me, boss, even one of those
boxes and we are set for life.</i>

1603
01:46:07,070 --> 01:46:08,363
Yeah.

1604
01:46:20,792 --> 01:46:22,252
<i>You have 30 seconds
to get to the cockpit...</i>

1605
01:46:22,418 --> 01:46:24,212
<i>...and override their security.</i>

1606
01:46:35,765 --> 01:46:37,308
Cloning transponder signal.

1607
01:46:37,475 --> 01:46:39,143
Launching decoy drone.

1608
01:46:43,273 --> 01:46:45,400
Entering new coordinates.

1609
01:46:51,406 --> 01:46:52,574
Good, so it's on its way.

1610
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:55,577
- Yes, sir, right on course.
- Okay, thank you.

1611
01:46:56,411 --> 01:46:57,829
All right.

1612
01:47:10,341 --> 01:47:11,968
Hot dog.

1613
01:48:01,601 --> 01:48:03,436
Just a typical homecoming...

1614
01:48:03,603 --> 01:48:06,314
...on the outside of an invisible jet...

1615
01:48:07,023 --> 01:48:08,733
...fighting my girlfriend's dad.

1616
01:48:18,284 --> 01:48:19,369
Oh, God!

1617
01:48:26,959 --> 01:48:29,045
I can't believe that worked.

1618
01:49:05,540 --> 01:49:07,792
Chief, they're losing altitude.
Get out of there.

1619
01:49:07,959 --> 01:49:09,085
I'm not going home empty-handed.

1620
01:49:19,387 --> 01:49:21,180
Oh, my God.

1621
01:49:35,695 --> 01:49:38,531
- <i>Get out of there. What are you doing?</i>
- Please turn, please turn!

1622
01:51:13,501 --> 01:51:15,211
Hey, Pedro.

1623
01:52:02,633 --> 01:52:03,676
Bingo.

1624
01:52:19,859 --> 01:52:21,652
Your wingsuit.

1625
01:52:21,819 --> 01:52:23,905
Your wingsuit's going to explode!

1626
01:52:31,287 --> 01:52:32,747
Time to go home, Pete.

1627
01:52:32,914 --> 01:52:34,373
I'm trying to save you!

1628
01:52:49,597 --> 01:52:50,973
No.

1629
01:52:51,641 --> 01:52:53,184
No.

1630
01:54:32,742 --> 01:54:34,660
It looked so insane. That whole...

1631
01:54:34,827 --> 01:54:36,162
Like, it was just crazy.

1632
01:54:36,328 --> 01:54:38,706
He... He was just, like...

1633
01:54:38,873 --> 01:54:40,875
And you were like...

1634
01:54:41,042 --> 01:54:42,918
And then I just hit him with the...

1635
01:54:43,085 --> 01:54:44,962
It was so... Oh, my God.

1636
01:54:45,129 --> 01:54:47,131
I mean, you saved me.

1637
01:54:47,465 --> 01:54:49,091
It was awesome.

1638
01:54:55,056 --> 01:54:56,807
Hey, Liz.

1639
01:54:58,309 --> 01:54:59,477
I'm gonna miss you.

1640
01:54:59,977 --> 01:55:01,562
Bye.

1641
01:55:02,188 --> 01:55:03,647
Liz.

1642
01:55:10,488 --> 01:55:11,697
Liz, look, I'm so sorry.

1643
01:55:12,740 --> 01:55:15,743
You say that a lot.
What are you sorry for this time?

1644
01:55:17,161 --> 01:55:18,204
The dance?

1645
01:55:19,538 --> 01:55:22,291
That was a pretty crappy thing to do.

1646
01:55:22,708 --> 01:55:23,793
Well, yeah, but I...

1647
01:55:23,959 --> 01:55:26,796
I mean, your dad... I can't imagine
what you're going through.

1648
01:55:26,962 --> 01:55:29,131
If there's anything I can do to help...

1649
01:55:29,298 --> 01:55:31,801
I guess we're moving to Oregon.

1650
01:55:31,967 --> 01:55:35,221
Mom says it's nice there, so that's cool.

1651
01:55:36,055 --> 01:55:40,226
Anyways, Dad doesn't want us
here during the trial. So...

1652
01:55:41,644 --> 01:55:44,313
Liz, I... I...

1653
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:46,148
Bye, Peter.

1654
01:55:47,024 --> 01:55:50,528
Whatever's going on with you,
I hope you figure it out.

1655
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:06,585
Congratulations, decathlon national champions.

1656
01:56:06,752 --> 01:56:08,504
Yeah!

1657
01:56:08,963 --> 01:56:11,382
I'll have to put this back
in the trophy case soon...

1658
01:56:11,549 --> 01:56:14,051
...but just for motivation
right now at this practice.

1659
01:56:14,218 --> 01:56:15,886
I'm ahead of the game,
but we will need...

1660
01:56:16,053 --> 01:56:17,596
...a new team captain next year.

1661
01:56:17,763 --> 01:56:20,432
So I am appointing Michelle.

1662
01:56:21,433 --> 01:56:23,102
Yeah!

1663
01:56:25,312 --> 01:56:26,522
Thank you.

1664
01:56:26,689 --> 01:56:28,149
My... My friends call me MJ.

1665
01:56:28,774 --> 01:56:30,818
I thought you didn't have any friends.

1666
01:56:30,985 --> 01:56:32,903
I didn't.

1667
01:56:37,783 --> 01:56:39,785
- I gotta go.
- Hey, where you going?

1668
01:56:42,496 --> 01:56:44,623
What are you hiding, Peter?

1669
01:56:46,917 --> 01:56:48,502
I'm just kidding. I don't care. Bye.

1670
01:56:48,669 --> 01:56:51,338
- All right, so we should run some drills.
- Yeah.

1671
01:56:59,763 --> 01:57:03,100
Hey, Happy. What...?
What are you doing here?

1672
01:57:04,059 --> 01:57:05,311
I really owe you one.

1673
01:57:07,396 --> 01:57:09,690
I don't know what I would do
without this job.

1674
01:57:09,857 --> 01:57:12,359
I mean, before I met Tony...

1675
01:57:41,472 --> 01:57:43,474
So how long you been here?

1676
01:57:43,641 --> 01:57:45,809
Long enough to be awkward.
Boss wants to see you.

1677
01:57:46,769 --> 01:57:49,647
- Is he here too?
- In the toilet? No, he's upstate.

1678
01:57:50,189 --> 01:57:51,690
Upstate... Like, upstate-upstate?

1679
01:57:51,857 --> 01:57:53,442
Yeah, let's go.

1680
01:57:54,818 --> 01:57:55,945
Take a look.

1681
01:57:56,111 --> 01:57:58,155
It's pretty impressive, huh?

1682
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:01,992
They just finished
remodeling the whole thing.

1683
01:58:28,185 --> 01:58:31,272
- You don't see that every day.
- Oh, there they are.

1684
01:58:31,939 --> 01:58:33,565
How was the ride up?

1685
01:58:33,983 --> 01:58:36,610
- Good.
- Give me a minute with the kid.

1686
01:58:37,361 --> 01:58:39,196
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1687
01:58:39,613 --> 01:58:40,990
I gotta talk to the kid.

1688
01:58:41,573 --> 01:58:42,658
I'll be close behind.

1689
01:58:42,825 --> 01:58:46,578
How about a loose follow?
All right? Boundaries are good.

1690
01:58:51,583 --> 01:58:52,793
Sorry I took your suit.

1691
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:55,462
You had it coming.
Actually, it turns out it was...

1692
01:58:55,629 --> 01:58:57,631
...the perfect tough-love
moment that you needed.

1693
01:58:57,798 --> 01:59:00,634
To urge you on, right?
Wouldn't you think? Don't you think?

1694
01:59:00,801 --> 01:59:02,594
- I guess.
- Let's just say it was.

1695
01:59:04,471 --> 01:59:07,683
- Mr. Stark, I really...
- You screwed the pooch hard, bigtime.

1696
01:59:08,309 --> 01:59:09,977
But then you did the right thing.

1697
01:59:10,144 --> 01:59:13,314
Took the dog to the free clinic,
you raised the hybrid puppies...

1698
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:15,357
All right, not my best analogy.

1699
01:59:16,567 --> 01:59:18,485
I was wrong about you.

1700
01:59:19,028 --> 01:59:21,280
I think, with a little more mentoring...

1701
01:59:21,447 --> 01:59:23,907
...you could be a real asset to the team.

1702
01:59:25,701 --> 01:59:27,536
- To the...? To the team?
- Yeah. Anyway...

1703
01:59:27,703 --> 01:59:30,748
...there's about 50 reporters behind that door.
Real ones, not bloggers.

1704
01:59:31,248 --> 01:59:33,083
When you're ready...

1705
01:59:33,459 --> 01:59:35,169
...why don't you try that on?

1706
01:59:35,336 --> 01:59:39,256
And I'll introduce the world to the newest
official member of the Avengers:

1707
01:59:39,423 --> 01:59:41,091
Spider-Man.

1708
01:59:43,552 --> 01:59:45,137
I...

1709
01:59:46,805 --> 01:59:49,058
Yeah, give that a look.

1710
01:59:54,563 --> 01:59:56,732
After the press conference,
Happy will show you to your room...

1711
01:59:56,899 --> 01:59:57,983
...your new quarters.

1712
01:59:58,150 --> 02:00:00,402
Where's he between?
He's next to Vision?

1713
02:00:00,569 --> 02:00:02,821
- Yeah, Vision's not big on doors.
- It's fun.

1714
02:00:02,988 --> 02:00:04,323
Or walls.

1715
02:00:04,490 --> 02:00:06,367
You'll fit right in.

1716
02:00:12,790 --> 02:00:14,792
Thank you, Mr. Stark.

1717
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:16,502
But I'm good.

1718
02:00:17,544 --> 02:00:20,047
You're good? Good...?
How are you good?

1719
02:00:20,214 --> 02:00:24,385
Well, I mean, I'd rather just stay
on the ground for a little while.

1720
02:00:24,551 --> 02:00:26,720
Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.

1721
02:00:26,887 --> 02:00:28,847
Somebody's got to look out
for the little guy, right?

1722
02:00:29,306 --> 02:00:30,766
You're turning me down?

1723
02:00:30,933 --> 02:00:33,018
You better think about this.
Look at that.

1724
02:00:33,185 --> 02:00:34,436
Look at me.

1725
02:00:35,187 --> 02:00:36,271
Last chance. Yes or no?

1726
02:00:36,438 --> 02:00:37,731
- No.
- Okay.

1727
02:00:37,898 --> 02:00:41,402
It's kind of a Springsteen-y,
working-class hero vibe that I dig.

1728
02:00:41,568 --> 02:00:43,570
Happy will take you home.

1729
02:00:43,737 --> 02:00:45,239
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1730
02:00:45,406 --> 02:00:47,574
Mind waiting in the car?
I need a minute.

1731
02:00:49,118 --> 02:00:51,787
- Thank you, Mr. Stark.
- Yes, Mr. Parker, very well.

1732
02:00:51,954 --> 02:00:53,664
- See you around.
- Okay.

1733
02:01:01,880 --> 02:01:03,090
That was a test, right?

1734
02:01:03,882 --> 02:01:06,343
- There's nobody back there?
- Yes, you passed.

1735
02:01:07,219 --> 02:01:10,097
- All right, skedaddle there, young buck.
- Thank you, Mr. Stark.

1736
02:01:10,264 --> 02:01:11,974
Yeah, thank you.

1737
02:01:14,059 --> 02:01:15,936
Told you he's a good kid.

1738
02:01:22,192 --> 02:01:23,652
- Where's the kid?
- He left.

1739
02:01:23,819 --> 02:01:26,738
- Everybody's waiting.
- He actually made a mature choice.

1740
02:01:26,905 --> 02:01:29,908
- It just surprised the heck out of us.
- Did you screw this up?

1741
02:01:30,075 --> 02:01:32,161
- He told the kid to go wait in the car.
- Are you kidding?

1742
02:01:32,327 --> 02:01:34,496
I have a room full of people
in there waiting...

1743
02:01:34,663 --> 02:01:36,457
...for some big announcement.
What will I tell them?

1744
02:01:36,623 --> 02:01:39,126
Think of something. How about...?

1745
02:01:39,668 --> 02:01:41,837
- Hap, you still got that ring?
- Do I...? I...?

1746
02:01:42,004 --> 02:01:43,172
- The engagement ring.
- Are you kidding?

1747
02:01:43,338 --> 02:01:46,550
I've been carrying this since 2008.

1748
02:01:49,219 --> 02:01:50,345
Okay.

1749
02:01:50,512 --> 02:01:52,097
I think I can think
of something better than that.

1750
02:01:52,264 --> 02:01:54,641
Well, it would buy us a little time.

1751
02:01:55,934 --> 02:01:58,061
Like we need time.

1752
02:01:58,228 --> 02:01:59,897
I can't believe you have
that in your pocket.

1753
02:02:00,063 --> 02:02:02,566
- Want me to get the door for you, hon?
- I got it.

1754
02:02:18,749 --> 02:02:21,210
Aunt May, did you do dinner already?

1755
02:02:31,470 --> 02:02:33,138
May?

1756
02:02:54,910 --> 02:02:55,953
What the...?!

1757
02:05:10,045 --> 02:05:12,005
Look who it is.

1758
02:05:13,924 --> 02:05:17,094
What are the odds you and I'd end up
at the same summer camp?

1759
02:05:17,260 --> 02:05:18,553
Relax.

1760
02:05:19,179 --> 02:05:21,181
This? It's not on you.

1761
02:05:21,348 --> 02:05:24,434
It's on our little spider friend.

1762
02:05:24,601 --> 02:05:28,188
I've got some boys on the outside
who would love to meet him.

1763
02:05:28,355 --> 02:05:31,817
You know, take a picture,
slice his throat, put his head in a dryer.

1764
02:05:32,359 --> 02:05:34,611
And I heard a rumor.

1765
02:05:37,864 --> 02:05:39,449
You know who he is.

1766
02:05:43,203 --> 02:05:45,539
If I knew who he was...

1767
02:05:45,706 --> 02:05:47,290
...he'd already be dead.

1768
02:05:51,837 --> 02:05:54,715
Toomes, your family's here!

1769
02:12:33,822 --> 02:12:36,658
Hi, I'm Captain America,
here to talk to you...

1770
02:12:36,825 --> 02:12:40,787
...about one of the most valuable
traits a soldier or student can have.

1771
02:12:40,954 --> 02:12:42,622
Patience.

1772
02:12:42,789 --> 02:12:44,916
Sometimes patience is the key to victory.

1773
02:12:45,083 --> 02:12:47,127
Sometimes it leads to very little...

1774
02:12:47,293 --> 02:12:49,629
...and it seems like it's not worth it.

1775
02:12:49,796 --> 02:12:51,297
And you wonder...

1776
02:12:51,464 --> 02:12:55,301
...why you waited so long
for something so disappointing.

1777
02:12:59,013 --> 02:13:01,015
How many more of these?
