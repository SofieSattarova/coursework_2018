1
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,426
<i>I used to want to save the world.</i>

2
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,222
<i>This beautiful place.</i>

3
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:59,101
<i>But I knew so little then.</i>

4
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,772
<i>It is a land of magic and wonder.</i>

5
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,317
<i>Worth cherishing in every way.</i>

6
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,446
<i>But the closer you get,</i>

7
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:16,285
<i>the more you see the great
darkness simmering within.</i>

8
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:23,250
<i>And mankind?</i>

9
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:26,920
<i>Mankind is another story altogether.</i>

10
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:34,177
<i>What one does when faced with the truth
is more difficult than you think.</i>

11
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,189
<i>I learned this the hard way.</i>

12
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,318
<i>A long, long time ago.</i>

13
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,196
<i>And now,</i>

14
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,701
<i>I will never be the same.</i>

15
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,376
<i>Merci.</i>

16
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,591
Hello, Diana.

17
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,510
- Hello, Diana.
- Hello.

18
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,470
<i>Diana!</i>

19
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,972
Diana!

20
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,557
<i>Come back!</i>

21
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,807
- It looks very good.
- Very good.

22
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:44,975
How is she doing?

23
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,143
She's good.

24
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,644
- Keep working with her.
- I will.

25
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:49,855
Naomi.

26
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,378
Diana!

27
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,339
Diana, I see you.

28
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,723
Where are you going?
Slow down!

29
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,860
Hello, Mother.

30
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,862
How are you today?

31
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,908
<i>Let's get you back to school
before another tutor quits.</i>

32
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,620
But don't you think it's time
to start my training?

33
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,039
Antiope thinks I'm ready.

34
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,041
Does she?

35
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,377
I could begin showing her some things.

36
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,381
She should at least be able
to defend herself.

37
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,591
From whom?

38
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,718
In the event of an invasion.

39
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,222
<i>Isn't that why I have the greatest
warrior in our history</i>

40
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,724
leading an entire army, General?

41
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,812
I pray a day will never come
where she has to fight.

42
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,065
But you know, a scorpion must sting,

43
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,818
- <i>a wolf must hunt...</i>
- She is a child.

44
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,945
<i>The only child on the island.
Please let her be so.</i>

45
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,112
<i>But, Mother...</i>

46
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,823
There will be no training.

47
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,207
<i>What if I promised to be careful?</i>

48
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,918
It's time to sleep.

49
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,005
What if I didn't use a sword?

50
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,842
Fighting does not make you a hero.

51
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,761
Just a shield then. No sharp edges.

52
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:49,099
Diana, you are the most precious
thing in the world to me.

53
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,979
I wished for you so much so,
I sculpted you from clay myself

54
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,690
and begged Zeus to give you life.

55
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,650
You've told me this story.

56
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:02,654
Which is why tonight
I will tell you a new one.

57
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,449
A story of our people,
and my days of battle.

58
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,617
Yes!

59
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:11,288
So you will finally understand
why war is nothing to hope for.

60
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,338
Long ago, when time was new

61
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,967
and all of history was still a dream,

62
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,469
<i>the Gods ruled the Earth,</i>

63
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,306
<i>Zeus king among them.</i>

64
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,020
<i>Zeus created beings over
which the Gods would rule.</i>

65
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,064
<i>Beings born in his image,</i>

66
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,902
<i>fair and good, strong and passionate.</i>

67
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,740
He called his creation "man."
And mankind was good.

68
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,911
But Zeus's son grew envious of mankind

69
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,331
and sought to corrupt
his father's creation.

70
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:58,835
<i>This was Ares, the God of War.</i>

71
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:05,216
Ares poisoned men's hearts
with jealousy and suspicion.

72
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,510
<i>He turned them against one another</i>

73
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,680
<i>and war ravaged the Earth.</i>

74
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:15,727
<i>So, the Gods created us, the Amazons,</i>

75
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,521
<i>to influence men's hearts with love</i>

76
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,191
<i>and restore peace to the Earth.</i>

77
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:27,364
<i>And for a brief time, there was peace.</i>

78
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,746
<i>But it did not last.</i>

79
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:45,090
<i>Your mother, the Amazon Queen, led a revolt</i>

80
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,218
<i>that freed us all from enslavement.</i>

81
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,478
<i>When Zeus led the Gods to our defense,</i>

82
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,898
<i>Ares killed them one by one,</i>

83
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,235
<i>until only Zeus himself remained.</i>

84
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:10,949
<i>Zeus used the last
of his power to stop Ares,</i>

85
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:16,579
<i>striking such a blow, the God
of War was forced to retreat.</i>

86
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:18,915
<i>But Zeus knew</i>

87
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:23,253
<i>that one day, Ares might
return to finish his mission.</i>

88
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,297
<i>An endless war,</i>

89
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,467
<i>where mankind would finally
destroy themselves,</i>

90
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,429
<i>and us with them.</i>

91
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,015
<i>So Zeus left us a weapon,</i>

92
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,268
<i>one powerful enough to kill a God.</i>

93
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:43,440
<i>With his dying breath,
Zeus created this island</i>

94
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,859
<i>to hide us from the outside world,</i>

95
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,361
<i>somewhere Ares could not find us.</i>

96
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,118
<i>And all has been quiet ever since.</i>

97
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:07,005
We give thanks to the Gods
for giving us this paradise.

98
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,467
And the Godkiller?

99
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,181
The Godkiller?

100
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,975
The weapon that's strong
enough to kill a god.

101
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,311
<i>Can I see it?</i>

102
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,198
The Gods gave us many gifts.

103
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,658
One day, you'll know them all.

104
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,079
This great tower is where we keep them.

105
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:52,675
The Godkiller.

106
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:57,972
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

107
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,934
Who would wield it?

108
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,022
I pray it will never be called to arms.

109
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,692
But only the fiercest
among us even could.

110
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,070
And that is not you, Diana.

111
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,281
You see, you're safe,

112
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,785
and there is nothing you
should concern yourself with.

113
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,967
You keep doubting yourself, Diana.

114
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,344
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

115
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,221
No, I don't.

116
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,310
You are stronger than you believe.

117
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,563
<i>You have greater powers than you know.</i>

118
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,648
<i>- But if you don't try hard...
- Diana!</i>

119
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,411
Are you hurt?

120
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,163
No, Mother, I'm fine,

121
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,039
- I was just...
- Training.

122
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,043
It seems I'm not the revered
queen I should be.

123
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,421
Disobeyed, betrayed by my own sister...

124
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,798
No, Mother.
It was me, I asked her to...

125
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,175
Take her to the palace.

126
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,011
Off you go.

127
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,730
You left me no choice, Hippolyta.

128
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:33,151
You neglect your duty
if she cannot fight.

129
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,403
You speak of a time that may never come.

130
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,489
He might never return.

131
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,367
He could have died from his wounds.

132
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,454
Ares is alive.

133
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,957
You feel it, as I do, in your bones.

134
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,252
It is only a matter of time
before he returns.

135
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:59,010
The stronger she gets,
the sooner he'll find her.

136
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,930
Hippolyta, I love her as you do.

137
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:06,392
But this is the only way
to truly protect her.

138
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,865
You will train her harder
than any Amazon before her.

139
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:23,451
<i>Five times harder,</i>

140
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,662
<i>ten times harder.</i>

141
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,748
<i>Until she is better than even you.</i>

142
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,292
<i>But she must never know the truth</i>

143
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,211
<i>about what she is</i>

144
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,213
<i>or how she came to be.</i>

145
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,102
Harder.

146
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:34,063
<i>You're stronger than this, Diana.</i>

147
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,398
Again.

148
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,000
Never let your guard down.

149
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,961
You expect the battle to be fair.

150
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,546
A battle will never be fair.

151
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,478
Antiope!

152
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,397
Lay still.

153
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:17,774
You are bleeding.

154
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,778
- I'm sorry...
- Wait, Diana, wait.

155
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,243
What have I done?

156
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,163
I'm sorry.

157
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,775
<i>Where did this fog come from?</i>

158
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:12,198
There. Go forward!

159
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,425
<i>There he is! The pilot! I can see him.</i>

160
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,802
He's there!

161
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,667
Wow.

162
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,088
You're a man.

163
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,345
Yeah. I mean...

164
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,016
Do I not look like one?

165
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,813
Where are we?

166
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,857
Themyscira.

167
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,275
Therma-what?

168
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,776
Who are you?

169
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,787
I'm one of the good guys,
and those are the bad guys.

170
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,997
What?

171
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,874
The Germans. Come on,
we need to get out of here.

172
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,168
- The Germans?
- <i>Diana!</i>

173
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,545
Step away from her, now!

174
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,049
<i>Ready your bows!</i>

175
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,887
They have guns, right?

176
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,639
Fire!

177
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,391
Fire!

178
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,894
Come on!

179
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,075
Stay there!

180
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,198
Shield!

181
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,137
No!

182
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,305
No!

183
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,562
No.

184
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:57,691
No, no. Antiope. Antiope.

185
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,528
Antiope, hey. Hey, hey.

186
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,322
Hey.

187
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:04,907
- Diana.
- Be still.

188
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,202
The time has come.

189
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,413
You... You must...

190
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,750
What? What, Antiope?

191
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,256
Godkiller.

192
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,883
- Diana, go...
- Go where?

193
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,010
- Go where?
- Go...

194
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,055
No, please, no. No. No!

195
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,182
No, no, no.

196
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,810
- No!
- Antiope!

197
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:35,563
No!

198
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,113
- You.
- No.

199
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,032
No, Mother, no.

200
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,951
He fought at my side
against the invaders.

201
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,953
What man fights against his own people?

202
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,956
- These aren't my people.
- Then why do you wear their colors?

203
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,084
I can't tell you that.

204
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,294
You need to tell us now!

205
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,503
What is your name?

206
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,256
I can't tell you that either.

207
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,885
We should kill him now,
and be done with it.

208
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,052
<i>If he dies,</i>

209
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:12,391
we know nothing about who they are,
and why they came.

210
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,734
My, uh,

211
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:27,656
name is Captain Steve Trevor, pilot,
American Expeditionary Forces.

212
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,951
Serial number 8141921.

213
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,370
That's all I'm at liberty to...

214
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,501
Assigned to British Intelligence.

215
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:42,963
What the hell is this thing?

216
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,175
The Lasso of Hestia compels
you to reveal the truth.

217
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,177
But it's really hot.

218
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:51,347
It is pointless, and painful, to resist.

219
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,307
What is your mission?

220
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:57,269
Whoever you are, you are
in more danger than you think.

221
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,479
What is your mission?

222
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:02,858
I am a...

223
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,530
I am a...

224
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,202
I am a spy.

225
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,999
I'm a spy. I'm a spy.

226
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,045
<i>British Intelligence got word</i>

227
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:25,673
<i>that the leader of the German Army,
General Ludendorff,</i>

228
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,718
<i>would be visiting a secret military
installation in the Ottoman Empire.</i>

229
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:33,055
<i>I posed as one of their pilots,
and flew in with them.</i>

230
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:36,725
<i>According to our intel,
the Germans had no troops left,</i>

231
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,561
<i>no money, no munitions of any kind.</i>

232
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,063
<i>But our intel was wrong.</i>

233
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,941
<i>The Germans had the Turks
building bombs for them.</i>

234
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:47,236
<i>And not just bombs, new weapons.</i>

235
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:48,988
<i>Secret weapons.</i>

236
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:55,202
<i>Invented by Ludendorff's
chief psychopath, Dr. Isabel Maru.</i>

237
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:59,081
<i>The boys in the trenches
called her "Dr. Poison."</i>

238
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:01,709
<i>And for good reason.</i>

239
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:34,074
<i>From what I could tell, if Dr. Maru
was able to complete her work,</i>

240
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:37,286
<i>millions more would die.
The war would never end.</i>

241
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,039
<i>I was there to observe
and report, nothing more,</i>

242
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:43,584
<i>but I had to do something.</i>

243
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:49,965
<i>I'm so close.</i>

244
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:53,177
<i>I know I can make the gas
penetrate the mask.</i>

245
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,554
I just... I need more time.

246
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,473
Unfortunately, Doctor,
we do not have more time.

247
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,558
This work, this...

248
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,148
Get that man!

249
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,524
<i>There!</i>

250
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:04,957
But if I can get these notes back
to British Intelligence in time,

251
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,293
it could stop millions more from dying.

252
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,213
It could stop the war.

253
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,507
War? What war?

254
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,136
The war.

255
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,558
The war to end all wars.

256
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,602
<i>Four years,</i>

257
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,021
<i>27 countries,</i>

258
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,149
25 million dead,

259
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,734
<i>soldiers and civilians.</i>

260
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,820
Innocent people,

261
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,990
women and children slaughtered.

262
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:42,828
<i>Their homes and their villages
looted and burned.</i>

263
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,168
Weapons far deadlier than you can

264
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,589
ever imagine.

265
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,678
It's like nothing I've ever seen.

266
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,848
<i>It's like the world's going to end.</i>

267
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,351
Should we let him go?

268
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,104
And risk him bringing
more men to our shores?

269
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,356
We cannot hold him forever, my queen.

270
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,609
Mother. Excuse me,

271
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:17,613
but after everything the man said,
this must be Ares.

272
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,031
What are you talking about, child?

273
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:22,201
Forgive me, Senator, but the man
called it "a war without end."

274
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,287
Millions of people already dead.

275
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,706
Like nothing he's ever seen.

276
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,292
Only Ares could do such a thing.

277
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:35,380
We cannot simply let him go.
We must go with him.

278
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,217
I will not deploy our army and
leave Themyscira defenseless

279
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,426
to go and fight their war.

280
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,470
It is not their war.

281
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:44,806
Zeus created man to be just and wise,
strong and passionate...

282
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,392
That was a story, Diana!

283
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,894
There is much you do not understand.

284
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,103
Men are easily corrupted.

285
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,065
Yes, but Ares is behind that corruption!

286
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:56,109
It is Ares who has these Germans fighting.

287
00:28:56,276 --> 00:29:00,322
<i>And stopping the God of War
is our foreordinance.</i>

288
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,908
As Amazons, this is our duty.

289
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,911
But you are not an Amazon
like the rest of us.

290
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:08,413
So you will do nothing.

291
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,082
As your queen, I forbid it.

292
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:24,513
Strange.

293
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:28,308
Is it true you saved his life?

294
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,851
Who told you that?

295
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,019
He did.

296
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:55,377
Whoa! I...

297
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,548
I didn't see you come in.

298
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,723
Would you say you're a

299
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,143
typical example of your sex?

300
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,437
I am

301
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,400
above average.

302
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,155
What's that?

303
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,491
It's a...

304
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:29,536
Oh! Um...

305
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,665
It's a watch.

306
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,083
A watch?

307
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,251
<i>Yeah, it's a watch.</i>

308
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,836
It tells time.

309
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,839
My father gave it to me.

310
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,051
It's been through hell and back with him.

311
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,472
Now it's with me,
and good thing it's still ticking.

312
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,515
What for?

313
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,019
Because it tells time.

314
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:57,939
When to eat, sleep, wake up, work.

315
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:02,486
You let this little thing
tell you what to do?

316
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,112
Yeah.

317
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,120
Can I ask you some questions?

318
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,956
- <i>Where are we?</i>
- Themyscira.

319
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:18,627
No, I got that before.
But I mean, where are we?

320
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,213
What is this place?
Who are you people?

321
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,465
Why does the water do that?

322
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:26,134
<i>How come you don't know what a watch is?
How come you speak English so well?</i>

323
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,428
We speak hundreds of languages.

324
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:32,682
We are the bridge to a greater
understanding between all men.

325
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:35,977
Right.

326
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,651
You know, I didn't get a chance
to say this, uh, earlier,

327
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:48,323
but thank you for dragging
me out of the water.

328
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,159
Thank you

329
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,829
for what you did on the beach.

330
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:02,963
So,

331
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,715
you're here to let me go?

332
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:10,679
I tried, but it's not up to me.

333
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,014
I even asked them to send me with you.

334
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:16,935
Or anyone.

335
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,145
An Amazon.

336
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,980
The Amazons.

337
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:21,606
The Amazons?

338
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,526
<i>It is our sacred duty
to defend the world.</i>

339
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,028
And I wish to go.

340
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,908
But my mother will not allow it.

341
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,328
Well,

342
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,874
I can't say I blame her.

343
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,041
<i>The way this war is going,</i>

344
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:43,128
I wouldn't want to let anyone
I care about near it.

345
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,213
Then why do you want to go back?

346
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,799
I don't think "want" is the word.

347
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:52,179
I guess I gotta try.

348
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,141
My father told me once,

349
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,643
he said, "If you see something
wrong happening in the world,

350
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,521
"you can either do nothing,
or you can do something."

351
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,400
And I already tried "nothing."

352
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,352
Nice outfit.

353
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:47,729
Oh, thank you.

354
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,483
Now, I will show you the way off the island

355
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,610
and you will take me to Ares.

356
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:55,445
Deal.

357
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:05,997
I'm leaving in that?

358
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,415
We are.

359
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,835
Yeah, we're leaving in that?

360
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,462
Do you not know how to sail?

361
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:13,755
Of course I know how to sail.

362
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:15,590
Why wouldn't I know how to sail?
It's just...

363
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:17,967
It's been a while.

364
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,957
I'm going, Mother.

365
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,752
I cannot stand by while
innocent lives are lost.

366
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:58,049
If no one else will defend the world
from Ares, then I must.

367
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,177
I have to go.

368
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,721
I know.

369
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,224
<i>Or at least I know I cannot stop you.</i>

370
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,690
There is so much...

371
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:15,942
So much you do not understand.

372
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:17,569
<i>I understand enough.</i>

373
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:21,281
That I'm willing to fight for those
who cannot fight for themselves.

374
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,493
Like you once did.

375
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:28,079
You know that if you choose to leave,

376
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,166
you may never return.

377
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,003
Who will I be if I stay?

378
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,848
This belonged to the greatest
warrior in our history,

379
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:50,018
our beloved Antiope.

380
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:52,312
Make sure you are worthy of it.

381
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,148
I will.

382
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,737
Be careful in the world of men, Diana.

383
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,657
They do not deserve you.

384
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:12,207
You have been my greatest love.

385
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,504
Today,

386
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,549
you are my greatest sorrow.

387
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,798
Should you have told her?

388
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:07,136
The more she knows,
the sooner he'll find her.

389
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,650
How long until we reach the war?

390
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,987
The war? Which part?

391
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,405
The Western Front in France

392
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:27,949
is 400 miles long from
the Alps to the North Sea.

393
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:31,536
Where the fighting
is the most intense, then.

394
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:34,581
If you take me there,
I'm sure I'll find Ares.

395
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,879
Ares? As in, the God of War?

396
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:45,133
The God of War is our responsibility.
Only an Amazon can defeat him.

397
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,635
With this.

398
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,263
And once I do,

399
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,432
the war will end.

400
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,649
Look, I appreciate your spirit,

401
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,360
<i>but this war is...</i>

402
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,738
It's a great big mess.

403
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:10,408
And there's not a whole lot
you and I can do about that.

404
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:13,161
I mean, we can get back to London,
and try to get to the men who can.

405
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,413
I'm the man who can!

406
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,373
And once I find and destroy Ares,

407
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,168
the German armies will be
freed from his influence

408
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:23,338
and they will be good men again,
and the world will be better.

409
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:28,843
Great.

410
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:30,845
You'll see.

411
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:35,350
What are you doing?

412
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,852
Oh, I thought maybe you'd want to

413
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,396
get some sleep.

414
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,527
And what about you?
Are you not sleeping?

415
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,363
Does the average man not sleep?

416
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:55,620
Yes, we sleep.
We just don't sleep with, uh...

417
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:56,788
You don't sleep with women?

418
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,874
No. I mean, I do sleep with...
I sleep with...

419
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,627
Yes, I do.

420
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:05,254
But, out of the, uh,

421
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,840
confines of marriage

422
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,425
it's just...

423
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,888
It's not polite to assume, you know?

424
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,102
"Marriage"?

425
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,187
Marriage. Do you not have that on...

426
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,815
You go before a judge

427
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:28,152
and you swear to love,
honor and cherish each other

428
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,445
until death do you part.

429
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,573
And do they?
Love each other till death?

430
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,492
Not very often, no.

431
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,077
Then why do they do it?

432
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:39,330
I have no idea.

433
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,833
So, you cannot sleep with me
unless I marry you.

434
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,210
I will sleep with you, if you want.
I'll sleep right there.

435
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:45,461
<i>There's plenty of room.</i>

436
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:48,172
- Then, fine, if you don't mind...
- No, it's up to you.

437
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,758
I know it's up to me, I'm making the choice.
I will come sleep with you.

438
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:51,926
Okay.

439
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:55,972
Yeah, just...

440
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:58,474
Okay.

441
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:18,119
You know, where I come from,
I'm not considered average.

442
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,080
You know, being a spy,

443
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:24,542
you have to show a certain amount of

444
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:27,795
vigor.

445
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:34,302
Have you never met a man before?
What about your father?

446
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:36,220
I had no father.

447
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,514
My mother sculpted me from clay

448
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,808
and I was brought to life by Zeus.

449
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:45,646
Well, that's neat.

450
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,651
<i>Sorry.</i>

451
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:54,655
Where I come from,

452
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,201
babies are made differently.

453
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,037
You refer to reproductive biology.

454
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:02,789
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah, I know.

455
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,124
I know all about that.

456
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:08,127
I mean, I refer to that,
and other things.

457
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:10,338
The pleasures of the flesh.

458
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:15,134
Do you know about that?

459
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:20,098
I've read all 12 volumes of Clio's
<i>Treatises on Bodily Pleasure</i>.

460
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,976
- All 12, huh?
- <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

461
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,066
Did you bring any of those with you?

462
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:31,859
You would not enjoy them.

463
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,361
I don't know. Maybe.

464
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:34,654
<i>No, you wouldn't.</i>

465
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,197
Why not?

466
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:39,492
They came to the conclusion that men
are essential for procreation,

467
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:41,536
but when it comes to pleasure,

468
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,788
unnecessary.

469
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,456
No, no.

470
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:51,087
Good night.

471
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,547
Night.

472
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,686
How long until we are operational?

473
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:08,062
Two days, sir.

474
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:09,897
You have until tonight, Captain.

475
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:14,193
Sir, the men have had no food, no sleep.

476
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,529
Do you think I have had
any food or rest, Captain?

477
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:18,614
Do you hear me making excuses?

478
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:19,782
No.

479
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:21,409
Your men are weak, complacent.

480
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:24,537
You've let them forget that an attack
can happen at any time,

481
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:26,122
from any quarter!

482
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:27,456
So, let's you and I remind them,

483
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,624
shall we?

484
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:45,224
- Doctor.
- General.

485
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:46,392
Progress?

486
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:47,852
Not enough.

487
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:50,688
It is over, General.

488
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,732
Germany is giving up.

489
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:56,819
Von Hindenburg has recommended
the <i>Kaiser</i> sign the armistice.

490
00:44:56,986 --> 00:44:59,030
We have run out of time.

491
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:03,451
As soon as the <i>Kaiser</i>
sees the newest weapon,

492
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:05,328
he will not sign the armistice.

493
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:06,579
But, without my book...

494
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:07,997
We will get your book!

495
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:10,625
It is you that I believe in. Not it.

496
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:15,046
I know that you can,
and will, succeed. Hmm.

497
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:20,218
It is what you were put
on this earth to do.

498
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:27,266
Something did come to me last night.

499
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,435
A different type of gas.

500
00:45:30,353 --> 00:45:31,437
For you.

501
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,981
<i>To restore your strength.</i>

502
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:06,430
<i>I've got it. I've got it!</i>

503
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:10,101
And if it's what I think,

504
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:13,104
it's going to be

505
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:16,190
terrible.

506
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:38,671
<i>Morning!</i>

507
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,716
We got lucky, we caught a ride.
We made some good time.

508
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:44,218
<i>Welcome to jolly old London!</i>

509
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,012
It's hideous.

510
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,014
Yeah, it's not for everybody.

511
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:11,871
- Morning, darling.
- What a beauty.

512
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:13,039
Hello, beautiful!

513
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,708
Gentlemen, eyes to yourself.
Thank you so much.

514
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,628
Come on! Come on.

515
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:22,757
Why are they holding hands?

516
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:25,801
Uh, probably because they're together.

517
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:31,098
No, no, no. We're not together.
I mean, in that way.

518
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,266
This way.

519
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:33,642
To the war!

520
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:36,354
Well, technically, the war is that way.
But we gotta go this way first.

521
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,022
And where are we going?

522
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:39,940
We gotta get this notebook
to my superiors.

523
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,192
Hey, hey, hey!

524
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:44,487
No, no, no. I let you go,
you take me to Ares.

525
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,405
We made a deal, Steve Trevor.

526
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,948
And a deal is a promise.

527
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,950
And a promise is unbreakable.

528
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,787
Oh, boy. Damn it. All right.

529
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:55,873
You come with me first to deliver this,

530
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,334
and then we'll get you a ticket, uh...

531
00:47:58,584 --> 00:47:59,668
to the war.

532
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,961
Deal?

533
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:03,589
- Let's go.
- Diana...

534
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:04,757
What are you doing?

535
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:06,884
You can't do that because you're
not wearing any clothes.

536
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:10,304
Let's go...
Let's go buy you some clothes.

537
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:12,264
What do these women wear into battle?

538
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:13,808
They don't, uh...

539
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,601
A baby!

540
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,229
- No, no, no. No babies.
- Oh... Oh...

541
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:20,064
No, please. No babies.

542
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:22,024
That one's not made out of clay.

543
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:23,442
Come on.

544
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,611
Diana! Please.

545
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:43,337
Thank God! You're not dead!

546
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:46,465
Hoorah and huzzah!

547
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,926
I did think you were dead
until I got your call, you know?

548
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,720
<i>He's been gone for weeks.
Not a single word.</i>

549
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:52,888
<i>Very unlike him.</i>

550
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:55,474
I'm introducing myself.
It's Etta Candy.

551
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,643
I'm Steve Trevor's secretary.

552
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,145
What is a secretary?

553
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,688
Ooh! Well, I do everything.

554
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:02,940
I go where he tells me to go,
and I do what he tells me to do.

555
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:05,985
Well, where I'm from,
that's called slavery.

556
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:07,278
I really like her.

557
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:08,654
Fantastic. Ladies, after you.

558
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:09,989
Oh, I do, I like her.

559
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:12,074
And it does rather feel like that,

560
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:13,784
except the pay is very good.

561
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,287
We've got our work cut out
for us, haven't we?

562
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:22,376
Is this what passes
for armor in your country?

563
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,212
"Armor." It's fashion.

564
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:26,839
Keeps our tummies in.

565
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,632
Why must you keep them in?

566
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,051
Only a woman with no tummy
would ask that question.

567
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:36,307
Conservative, but not entirely un-fun.

568
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:38,934
Try it on, at least.

569
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,144
Very well.

570
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:43,022
- Ooh! Ah, ah, ah...
- No! No, no, no.

571
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,523
Ooh!

572
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:51,405
Come on! Oh!

573
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,917
How can a woman possibly fight in this?

574
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,168
Fight?

575
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,920
We use our principles.

576
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,796
I mean, that's how we're
going to get the vote.

577
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:11,717
Although, I am not opposed
to engaging in a bit of fisticuffs,

578
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:13,636
should the occasion arise.

579
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,263
Lovely.

580
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:17,556
Oop!

581
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:20,184
It's itchy. It's choking me.

582
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,646
Can't say I blame it.

583
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,064
Etta.

584
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:26,232
Where is she?

585
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,776
Oh, she's trying on outfit number 226.

586
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:41,747
Miss Candy, the whole point
was to make her look less

587
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:43,082
<i>distracting.</i>

588
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:46,418
May I?

589
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,466
<i>Really? Specs?</i>

590
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:54,760
And suddenly she's not the most
beautiful woman you've ever seen?

591
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,643
Better.

592
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:15,114
Yeah, that's not going to work.

593
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:16,991
Please put the sword down, Diana.

594
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:18,158
Diana!

595
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:20,536
Let me try it by myself.

596
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,787
After you, sir.

597
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:32,339
Etta...

598
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,092
Why don't I meet you back at the office

599
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:37,344
and, meanwhile,
I'll take this for safekeeping.

600
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:38,512
Oh, no, I don't think so.

601
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,431
You gotta put the sword down, Diana.
Please.

602
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:41,849
- It doesn't go with the outfit.
- At all.

603
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:44,643
Put the sword down, first of all.

604
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:50,649
Promise me you will
protect it with your life.

605
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:52,943
Yes... No.

606
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:55,237
You can trust her. Just hand that over.

607
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:57,239
- Shield.
- And the shield to her.

608
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:58,407
There we go. Whoa!

609
00:51:58,574 --> 00:51:59,575
You got it? Thanks, Etta.

610
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:01,660
This is easy.

611
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:04,413
Oh. There we go.

612
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,275
What is it?

613
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:37,529
Hopefully nothing. Come on.

614
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:49,249
- Steve, why are we hiding?
- Shh! Come on, come on.

615
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,469
Captain Trevor.

616
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:04,431
I believe you have something that is
the property of General Ludendorff.

617
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:08,727
Ah, it's the, uh, bad-guy convention.

618
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:11,438
Give us Dr. Maru's notebook.

619
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:13,565
Where did I put that thing?

620
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:17,027
Stand back!

621
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:28,747
Or maybe not.

622
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:45,973
Tough luck.

623
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:54,314
Is there anything else
you want to show me?

624
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:56,817
Where do you think you're going?

625
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:00,821
Oh!

626
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:06,285
I'm sorry. But you are clearly
under his control.

627
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:09,163
- Diana...
- Let me help you get free.

628
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,873
Where will I find Ares?

629
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,507
- He's... He's dead.
- Hmm.

630
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,509
Cyanide.

631
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,061
Stay here. I'll be right back.

632
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:36,023
<i>Gentlemen! Gentlemen, please!</i>

633
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:40,652
The sad truth is, the majority of them
don't even know what they're fighting for!

634
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:41,820
Let him speak!

635
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:44,156
Yes, thank you. Gentlemen...

636
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:48,744
Germany is an immensely proud nation.

637
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:51,872
They will never surrender.

638
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,917
Now, look.
The only way to end this war...

639
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:58,420
Colonel, I have to talk to you outside.

640
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:00,839
<i>...and restore world peace</i>

641
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:02,549
is to negotiate

642
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,969
an armistice.

643
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:08,972
- <i>There's a woman in here.</i>
- Um...

644
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,599
What's she doing in here?
Get her out.

645
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:13,727
Get her out.

646
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:15,437
Sorry.

647
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:17,898
Blind sister. She got lost
on the way to the bathroom.

648
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:20,067
I think it's this way.
Sorry, guys.

649
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:22,945
Um... Our only aim at this time

650
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:25,739
must be to achieve peace,

651
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:27,783
at any cost!

652
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:33,580
Why do they not let him speak?
He's talking peace.

653
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,249
Not right now. Sorry.

654
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:42,798
Trevor, what the hell were you thinking,
bringing a woman into the Council Chamber?

655
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:44,925
The intel that I brought
back is time-sensitive.

656
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:46,510
This is one of Dr. Maru's notebooks.

657
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:47,678
Notebook or not...

658
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:48,846
We need to get it to cryptography

659
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,597
and I need an immediate
audience with the generals.

660
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,933
You do not just barge in here and
demand an audience with the Cabinet.

661
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,643
Sir, with all due respect,
what I saw in my last mission

662
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:55,853
could change the course of the war.

663
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,437
<i>Captain Trevor!</i>

664
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,649
I heard we'd lost you
on one of your missions,

665
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:02,317
yet here you are, back from the dead,

666
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,403
and I see you've brought a friend with you.

667
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:05,946
Our deepest apologies
for the interruption, sir.

668
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:07,739
No, no, no. Nonsense.

669
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:09,616
Thanks to this young woman,

670
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:13,287
the room was finally quiet enough for me
to get at least a few words in.

671
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,330
Sir Patrick Morgan, at your service.

672
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:17,958
Diana, Princess of Themys...

673
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:19,960
"Prince." Diana Prince.

674
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:21,837
She is, uh...

675
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:23,005
And I...

676
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,214
Are...

677
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,382
Working together.

678
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:27,509
<i>She actually helped me bring this,
uh, notebook back here.</i>

679
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:29,970
<i>That's from Dr. Maru's lab.</i>

680
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:32,806
I think the information contained inside
will change the course of the war, sir.

681
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:34,808
My God.

682
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:37,811
- Dr. Poison, herself.
- Yes.

683
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,009
<i>Yes.</i>

684
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,094
<i>Intriguing.</i>

685
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,554
Any further intelligence?

686
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:15,766
Sadly not, sir.
Cryptography have had no luck.

687
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:17,851
It seems like it's a mixture of two languages,

688
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:21,563
but, as yet, they've failed
to determine which two languages.

689
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:23,357
Ottoman and Sumerian.

690
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,236
Surely, someone else
in this room knew that.

691
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:29,488
Who is this woman?

692
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:31,365
<i>She's my, um,</i>

693
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:33,075
secretary, sir.

694
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:35,911
And she can understand
Ottoman and Sumerian?

695
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:37,955
She's a very good secretary.

696
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:39,539
See her out.

697
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,834
Sir, if this woman can read it,

698
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,836
<i>we should hear what she has to say.</i>

699
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,713
Yes, very well.

700
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,388
It's a formula

701
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:56,431
for a new kind of gas.

702
00:57:57,015 --> 00:58:00,519
Mustard gas.
Hydrogen-based, instead of sulfur.

703
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:01,770
Hydrogen-based...

704
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:04,564
Gas masks would be useless
against hydrogen.

705
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,567
The book says they plan
to release the gas

706
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:09,069
at "the front"?

707
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:10,237
When?

708
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:11,571
It doesn't say.

709
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,323
Wait. "Front" of what?

710
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,491
Sir,

711
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:16,451
that is the evidence we need.

712
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:18,078
You have to find out where
they're making that gas.

713
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:19,413
You have to burn it to the ground.

714
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:20,580
Destroy it.

715
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:23,291
Ludendorff was last seen in Belgium.

716
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:27,587
We can't be seen sending troops
into German-occupied Belgium

717
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:30,465
as we are negotiating their surrender.

718
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:32,384
Sir, I've seen that gas with my own eyes.

719
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:35,303
If it is used, it will kill
everyone on both sides.

720
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:36,513
They will all die.

721
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,599
That is what soldiers do, Captain.

722
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:42,185
<i>Send me in with some logistical support.</i>

723
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:45,480
At least give me the chance to take out
Ludendorff's operation myself.

724
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:46,773
Are you insane?

725
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,234
I can't introduce rogue
elements this late in the game.

726
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:50,402
Sir, I can...

727
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:51,778
<i>Now, more than ever,</i>

728
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:55,615
the armistice is of paramount importance.

729
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:59,411
It must be negotiated,
it must be signed, and this is...

730
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:02,956
Well, it's the best way
of stopping the war.

731
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:05,125
Captain, you will do nothing.

732
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:07,294
And that is an order.

733
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:09,254
Yes, sir.

734
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:11,465
I understand, sir.

735
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:13,467
I don't!

736
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,260
Diana, I know this is confusing...

737
00:59:15,427 --> 00:59:17,471
- <i>It is not confusing! It's unthinkable!</i>
- Who is this woman?

738
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:18,638
She's with me. She's with us, sir.

739
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:19,890
I am not with you!

740
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:23,143
You would knowingly
sacrifice all those lives,

741
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:24,311
as if they mean less than yours!

742
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:26,146
- Diana, let's talk about this outside.
- As if they mean nothing?

743
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:29,649
Where I come from, generals don't
hide in their offices like cowards.

744
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,943
- That's enough!
- They fight alongside their soldiers.

745
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,653
They die with them on the battlefield!

746
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,197
- That's enough!
- You should be ashamed.

747
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:37,199
- My apologies. Diana...
- You should be ashamed.

748
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:38,742
<i>- Diana...
- All of you should be ashamed!</i>

749
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,787
Please slow down!

750
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:43,288
That's your leader?

751
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:45,624
How could he say that?
Believe that?

752
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,209
And you!

753
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,169
Was your duty to simply
give them a book?

754
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:50,337
No!

755
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:51,671
You didn't stand your ground!
You didn't fight!

756
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,298
Because there was no chance
of changing his mind!

757
00:59:53,465 --> 00:59:56,134
This is Ares, and he's not
going to allow a negotiation

758
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,719
or a surrender!

759
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:00,514
The millions of people you
talked about, they will die!

760
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,140
We are going anyway!

761
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,269
You mean, you were lying?

762
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,647
I'm a spy! That's what I do!

763
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:09,856
How do I know you're not
lying to me right now?

764
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:17,030
I am taking you to the front.

765
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,741
We are probably going to die.

766
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:22,702
This is a terrible idea.

767
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:29,334
We're going to need reinforcements.

768
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:41,179
These are the reinforcements?

769
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,764
Yup.

770
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,933
Are these even good men?

771
01:00:45,851 --> 01:00:47,060
Hmm. Relatively.

772
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:52,065
Even in Africa, gentlemen,
we haven't seen such luxuries.

773
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:56,528
But the luxury that we have now...
It's like we can't stop making money!

774
01:00:56,695 --> 01:00:58,947
So, my uncle, the prince, and I...

775
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:01,324
Boy! Which prince is that?

776
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:03,952
I decide to extend the opportunity
for a few good soldiers...

777
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:05,579
But, seriously, which prince?

778
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:09,416
Hey, Sultan Angora Mynx Cashmere,

779
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:11,251
<i>could I talk to you for a minute?</i>

780
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:13,753
Gentlemen, excuse me one second.

781
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:15,505
"Bar." Well, a "pub."

782
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,925
You bugger. I have been greasing
those peacocks all night, and you...

783
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:21,761
Oh, my goodness gracious.

784
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:23,763
That's a work of art.

785
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,557
Sameer, Diana. Diana, Sameer.

786
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:27,893
Hi, Diana.
You can call me Sammy, please.

787
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,060
"Sammy."

788
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:31,438
Sameer, I wouldn't do that, if I were you.

789
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:32,939
Sameer's a top undercover man.

790
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:35,442
<i>He can talk the skin off a cat
in as many languages as you can.</i>

791
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:55,378
Oh, you're done.

792
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:56,546
Where's Charlie?

793
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:01,551
<i>Le voilà.</i>

794
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,015
At least this "Charlie"
is good with his fists.

795
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,184
That's not Charlie.

796
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,151
That's Charlie.

797
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:23,490
Steven!

798
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:26,493
May God put a flower upon your head, son.

799
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:27,953
Good to see you.

800
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:31,498
<i>So, what were you fighting about?</i>

801
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:35,377
I mistook his glass for mine.
It happens.

802
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:37,128
This man is no fighter.

803
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:39,172
Charlie is an expert marksman.

804
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:40,674
It means he shoots people.

805
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,509
From very far away.

806
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:44,302
They never know what hit them.

807
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:48,556
So, how do you know who you kill
if you can't see their face?

808
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:50,892
I don't. Trust me, it's better that way.

809
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:52,435
You fight without honor.

810
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,646
Who gets paid for honor? Eh?

811
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:57,357
So, what's the job, boss?

812
01:02:58,858 --> 01:02:59,985
Uh, two days, tops.

813
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:02,570
We need, uh, supplies
and passage to Belgium.

814
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:03,822
And what's the going rate?

815
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:05,031
Better be a good pay.

816
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,325
Yeah, well, here's the thing.

817
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:10,328
Um, I told you it was going to be quick.

818
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,332
And there's a lot to be gained by this.

819
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:16,376
So, it's for a great cause...

820
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:17,794
Uh, freedom...

821
01:03:18,003 --> 01:03:19,004
Hmm.

822
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:20,588
Friendship,

823
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:24,175
uh, ending the war, friendship...

824
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:25,677
- Okay, you have no money.
- No.

825
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:34,602
What?

826
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:35,895
What is this?

827
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:37,522
We're going to drop her off at the front.

828
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:39,316
- "Dropping her off"?
- Yeah.

829
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:42,193
Listen, sweetheart, I'm not
going to get myself killed

830
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,528
helping a wee lassie out of a ditch.

831
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:45,739
- Know what I mean?
- Here's the little thief now!

832
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:47,907
We don't need your kind around here.

833
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:59,336
She did it!

834
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:02,797
I'm both frightened and aroused.

835
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,722
- Oh, here they are! Sorry I'm late.
- Sir Patrick!

836
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:12,390
Yes, that's what I was going to mention.

837
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:16,061
- Sir Patrick.
- <i>Oh, no, no, no.</i>

838
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:18,396
Please, gentlemen, sit.
Miss Prince, sit.

839
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:24,819
I assume you're here planning something

840
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:28,156
that's going to get you either
court-martialed or killed.

841
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:30,200
And I assume you're here to stop us.

842
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:31,951
No.

843
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,787
Not at all, in fact.

844
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:35,789
Well, look.

845
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:37,248
I was a younger man, once.

846
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:40,418
And, had I been in better health,
I'd like to think that I might do the same.

847
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:41,628
Hmm.

848
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:44,089
<i>It's a very, very honorable
thing you're doing.</i>

849
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:45,256
Therefore,

850
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:47,801
I'm here to help.

851
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:49,844
Unofficially, of course.

852
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:52,180
What's your plan?

853
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:56,643
If there's another weapons facility,
find it and destroy it.

854
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,104
Along with Ludendorff and Maru.

855
01:05:00,355 --> 01:05:03,108
In that case, to allay suspicion,

856
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:07,904
the charming Etta, here, could, uh,
run the mission from my office.

857
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:09,489
"Run"...

858
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:12,700
Also,

859
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:16,162
there's enough here for a few days.

860
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:22,710
Thank you, sir.

861
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:24,462
You're very welcome.

862
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:27,048
Take great care, all of you,

863
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:28,216
<i>and good luck.</i>

864
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:40,562
Cheers!

865
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,531
Fresh ice cream, made today. Hello, miss.

866
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:53,032
Would you like to buy an ice cream?

867
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:54,784
- Me?
- Are you hungry?

868
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:55,952
Yes.

869
01:05:56,161 --> 01:05:57,370
Thank you.

870
01:05:57,537 --> 01:05:58,580
Eight pence, please, sir.

871
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:00,039
Here you go, pal. Keep the change.

872
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:02,375
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Mmm.

873
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:04,043
- What do you think?
- It's wonderful!

874
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:05,211
Yeah.

875
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,840
- You should be very proud.
- <i>Thank you very much!</i>

876
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:10,383
You should be very proud.

877
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:17,056
<i>It's a long way to Tipperary</i>

878
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:20,602
<i>It's a long way to go</i>

879
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:24,022
I hope our guy meets us here.
Chief's expecting us before dark.

880
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:25,773
"Chief"?

881
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:28,401
Uh, yeah. A smuggler.

882
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:30,695
Very reputable.

883
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:34,199
A liar, a murderer, and now a smuggler.

884
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:35,742
Lovely.

885
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:37,535
Careful, I might get offended.

886
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:39,245
I wasn't referring to you.

887
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:40,705
Really?

888
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:42,916
I went undercover and pretended
to be somebody else,

889
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:44,751
shot people on your beach,
and smuggled a notebook.

890
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:47,420
Liar, murderer, smuggler.
Are you still coming?

891
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:08,066
It's awful.

892
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:10,944
That's why we're here.

893
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:30,797
The gas will kill everything.

894
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:33,675
What kind of weapon kills innocents?

895
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:35,677
In this war,

896
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:37,178
every kind.

897
01:07:42,684 --> 01:07:45,186
You were absent at the
council meeting, General.

898
01:07:45,353 --> 01:07:48,064
I see you are negotiating the terms
of the armistice without me.

899
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:50,984
- On the <i>Kaiser's</i> behalf.
- And on your insistence!

900
01:07:51,526 --> 01:07:54,612
We could easily win this war,
if only you had a little faith.

901
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:56,072
<i>We don't.</i>

902
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:57,907
<i>There are shortages of food,</i>

903
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,867
medicine, ammunition.

904
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:04,747
Every hour we delay costs
thousands of German lives.

905
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:07,584
One attack and the war can be ours!

906
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:12,088
As we speak, my chemist...

907
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:14,465
We stand against you and your

908
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:15,758
witch.

909
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:18,094
Ludendorff, enough!

910
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:21,431
Twenty-four hours from now,

911
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:23,683
this war will end.

912
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:25,768
It is over.

913
01:08:26,978 --> 01:08:28,563
It is over for you.

914
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:33,735
It is over for all of you.

915
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:51,961
But the mask won't help.

916
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,005
They don't know that.

917
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:09,979
Let's go!

918
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:12,440
Time to stage a demonstration
for the <i>Kaiser!</i>

919
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:15,943
You're late.

920
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:17,487
<i>Cowboy sneak-attack, Chief!</i>

921
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:19,489
How are you?

922
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:21,824
- Good to see you, pal.
- <i>Okay, big man!</i>

923
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:26,496
- Good to see you.
- Ah, yes!

924
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:28,748
Good to see you, my friend.

925
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:30,917
You beauty!

926
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:33,044
Who is this?

927
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:41,469
And I am Diana.

928
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:43,388
Where did you find her?

929
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:45,098
She found me.

930
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:47,975
- I plucked him from the sea.
- <i>It's a long story.</i>

931
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:49,227
We don't have to talk
about that right now.

932
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:50,812
What's there?

933
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:53,981
British tea for the Germans,

934
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:56,109
German beer for the British.

935
01:09:57,819 --> 01:10:00,196
And Edgar Rice Burroughs novels for both.

936
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:01,406
And guns!

937
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:06,285
Well, may we get what we want!

938
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:07,787
May we get what we need.

939
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:10,206
But may we never get what we deserve.

940
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:11,749
Bang!

941
01:10:18,673 --> 01:10:20,007
Strange thunder.

942
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:23,052
German 77s.

943
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:24,721
Guns. Big ones.

944
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:27,306
It's the front, out there.

945
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:30,017
The evening hate.

946
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:32,645
So, who do you fight for in this war?

947
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:33,980
I don't fight.

948
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:36,149
<i>You're here for profit, then?</i>

949
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:38,526
No better place to be.

950
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:41,988
Nowhere better to be than in a war
where you don't take a side?

951
01:10:42,155 --> 01:10:43,322
<i>I have nowhere else.</i>

952
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:45,324
The last war took everything
from my people.

953
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:46,784
We have nothing left.

954
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:48,870
At least here,

955
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:51,080
I'm free.

956
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:53,541
Who took that from your people?

957
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:55,501
His people.

958
01:11:00,548 --> 01:11:01,549
<i>Don't</i> go...

959
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,886
Don't go in. Don't go!

960
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:07,346
<i>Don't! Boys, no!</i>

961
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:08,514
Don't go in there!

962
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,141
Shh. You're safe.

963
01:11:10,308 --> 01:11:12,477
You're safe. Are you okay?

964
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:13,978
Get off me, woman!

965
01:11:14,145 --> 01:11:15,688
Stop making a fuss!

966
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:17,190
God!

967
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:23,654
He sees ghosts.

968
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:29,744
You're going to get cold.

969
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:31,037
Oh, I don't...

970
01:11:31,496 --> 01:11:33,873
Don't worry about Charlie.
He doesn't mean anything by it.

971
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,474
<i>Get out of there, now.
We've got to move!</i>

972
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:54,060
You bloody animal, move!
Go on! Get on!

973
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:56,187
These animals, why are they hurting them?

974
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:58,356
Because they need to move, quick!

975
01:11:58,523 --> 01:12:00,191
- Like us!
- But this is not the way.

976
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,443
I could help them.

977
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:03,903
<i>There's no time. Come on, woman!</i>

978
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:08,199
Mama!

979
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,914
That man... He's wounded.

980
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:17,124
<i>There is nothing you can
do about it, Diana.</i>

981
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:18,835
<i>We must keep moving!</i>

982
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:41,107
What is this?

983
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:43,317
You wanted me to take you to the war.
This is it.

984
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:44,861
So, where are the Germans?

985
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,446
A couple hundred yards across the field.

986
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:48,948
- Their trench is...
- Watch out!

987
01:12:51,576 --> 01:12:53,744
Chief! It's good to see you!

988
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:56,122
<i>Oi! Chief's back! He's back!</i>

989
01:12:57,582 --> 01:12:58,749
All right, let's move!

990
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:17,143
- Diana, we have to go.
- We need to help these people.

991
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:18,311
We have to stay on-mission.

992
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:19,812
The next safe crossing
is at least a day away.

993
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:22,398
- What are we waiting for?
- We cannot leave without helping them.

994
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:24,150
These people are dying.

995
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:25,985
They have nothing to eat,
and in the village...

996
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:27,570
- Enslaved, she said!
- I understand that.

997
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:28,738
Women and children!

998
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,114
We need to make our
next position by sundown.

999
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:32,450
How can you say that?
What is the matter with you?

1000
01:13:32,617 --> 01:13:34,660
This is No Man's Land, Diana!

1001
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:37,121
It means no man can cross it, all right?

1002
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:39,624
This battalion has been
here for nearly a year

1003
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:42,168
and they barely gained an inch.

1004
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:45,630
Because, on the other side,
there are a bunch of Germans

1005
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:47,965
pointing machine guns at every
square inch of this place.

1006
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:50,384
This is not something you can cross.
It's not possible.

1007
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:51,928
So what? So, we do nothing?

1008
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:53,846
No, we are doing something.
We are.

1009
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:55,306
- We just...
- Steve.

1010
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:56,891
We can't save everyone in this war.

1011
01:13:57,058 --> 01:13:58,267
<i>Steve, Steve...</i>

1012
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:00,394
This is not what we came here to do.

1013
01:14:16,494 --> 01:14:17,495
No,

1014
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:19,664
but it's what I'm going to do.

1015
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:36,222
Diana!

1016
01:14:58,411 --> 01:15:00,705
What the bloody hell is she playing at?

1017
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:19,473
She's taking all the fire!
Let's go!

1018
01:15:22,977 --> 01:15:25,062
Stay down! Stay down!

1019
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:26,605
<i>That's an order!</i>

1020
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:20,659
Go, now!

1021
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:22,745
<i>She's done it!
She's got them on the run!</i>

1022
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:28,834
Get down, get down! She's done it!

1023
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:43,974
Steve!

1024
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:45,267
Let's go!

1025
01:16:48,062 --> 01:16:49,772
Come on, go!

1026
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:11,627
Stay here. I'll go ahead.

1027
01:17:47,246 --> 01:17:48,622
- What the...
- Let's move!

1028
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:28,454
<i>We need more firepower.</i>

1029
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:45,656
Sniper!

1030
01:19:45,823 --> 01:19:47,116
Go!

1031
01:19:49,326 --> 01:19:50,327
Get in!

1032
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:51,954
Charlie, bell tower!

1033
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:01,171
<i>Come on, Charlie. Shoot him!</i>

1034
01:20:02,423 --> 01:20:04,383
Hey, it's okay.

1035
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:07,720
<i>Huh.</i>

1036
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:11,515
Follow me! Give me some cover!

1037
01:20:17,688 --> 01:20:19,398
Right!

1038
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:22,276
We're going to put this on our backs,
and, when I say go,

1039
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:23,402
- lift hard!
- Okay.

1040
01:20:24,445 --> 01:20:26,322
<i>Diana! Shield!</i>

1041
01:20:30,409 --> 01:20:31,910
Go!

1042
01:21:33,597 --> 01:21:35,641
<i>Stay very, very still for me, my friends.</i>

1043
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:37,434
<i>Please. So important.</i>

1044
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:42,439
Thank you very much.

1045
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:45,317
This has been such an honor for me,
taking your photograph.

1046
01:21:45,484 --> 01:21:46,527
Thank you so much.

1047
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:55,244
<i>For all his talk of shooting,</i>

1048
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:56,995
he cannot shoot.

1049
01:22:00,082 --> 01:22:02,626
Not everyone gets to be what
they want to be all the time.

1050
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:05,587
Me, I am an actor.

1051
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:07,131
I love acting.

1052
01:22:07,297 --> 01:22:09,007
I didn't want to be a soldier.

1053
01:22:10,175 --> 01:22:11,635
But I'm the wrong color.

1054
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:14,930
Everyone is fighting
their own battles, Diana.

1055
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:17,808
Just as you are fighting yours.

1056
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:25,649
It's too much.
I wish you well.

1057
01:22:25,816 --> 01:22:26,817
Thank you, thank you.

1058
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:32,531
I'm on the... On the phone...

1059
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:35,534
Uh, it's "Veld." V-E-L-D.

1060
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:37,244
It's a tiny village.

1061
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:39,204
<i>It may not even be on the map.</i>

1062
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:40,706
Ooh! I found it! I found it!

1063
01:22:41,248 --> 01:22:42,833
<i>Did you find Ludendorff's operation?</i>

1064
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,835
No, no, no. But I located him.

1065
01:22:45,002 --> 01:22:47,463
And, oh, lucky you,
he's only a few miles away,

1066
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:49,465
at German High Command.

1067
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:51,550
<i>German High Command, huh?</i>

1068
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:53,343
So, intel reports

1069
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,679
<i>that Ludendorff is hosting a gala.</i>

1070
01:22:55,846 --> 01:22:57,222
<i>A sort of "last hurrah"</i>

1071
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:59,683
before the Germans sign the armistice.

1072
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:02,561
And the <i>Kaiser</i> himself
is going to be there.

1073
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:05,606
As well as Dr. Maru.

1074
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:07,691
Actually, the gala could
be perfect cover.

1075
01:23:07,858 --> 01:23:09,568
- <i>Captain Trevor.</i>
- Yes, sir.

1076
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:12,321
<i>You are, under no circumstances,
to go anywhere near</i>

1077
01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:14,531
that gala tomorrow night.
Do you hear me?

1078
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:16,700
<i>You'd be jeopardizing
everything we've worked for.</i>

1079
01:23:16,867 --> 01:23:19,203
<i>You cannot compromise the armistice.</i>

1080
01:23:19,369 --> 01:23:20,996
- Sir, there will be no armistice...
- Steve!

1081
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:22,998
...once Ludendorff bombs
the entire front line.

1082
01:23:23,165 --> 01:23:24,166
Hold on one second, sir.

1083
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:26,210
You shouldn't be bothered about
upsetting the peace accord.

1084
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:28,212
- Why not?
- Ares would never let...

1085
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:29,671
What?

1086
01:23:30,214 --> 01:23:31,215
What is it?

1087
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:33,717
Of course. It makes complete sense.

1088
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:38,305
Ares developed a weapon,
the worst ever devised.

1089
01:23:38,472 --> 01:23:40,224
- Ares? You mean Ludendorff.
- No.

1090
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:42,184
I mean Ares.

1091
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:44,186
Ludendorff is Ares!

1092
01:23:45,812 --> 01:23:47,564
Sir, this is our last chance,

1093
01:23:47,731 --> 01:23:49,483
our final chance to find out
where the gas is

1094
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:51,443
and to learn how Ludendorff
plans on delivering it.

1095
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:53,362
No, no, no. I forbid it.

1096
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:54,738
Do you hear me? I forbid it.

1097
01:23:54,905 --> 01:23:56,782
Sir, I'm losing you! Sir?

1098
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:57,950
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Sir...

1099
01:24:01,245 --> 01:24:02,955
How likely is he to respect my wishes?

1100
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:05,290
Not very likely, I'll be honest.

1101
01:24:11,588 --> 01:24:13,257
Sammy. Sammy, no. No, no, no.

1102
01:24:13,423 --> 01:24:15,300
Sammy, I have to work.

1103
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:16,635
I gotta rustle up a German uniform.

1104
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:18,095
I still have to plot
the course for tomorrow.

1105
01:24:18,262 --> 01:24:19,888
That's easy, boss. Come on.

1106
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:21,431
There is nothing we can do
until tomorrow.

1107
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:22,641
You said it yourself, Steve.

1108
01:24:22,808 --> 01:24:24,810
So... <i>Madame, s'il vous plaît.</i>

1109
01:24:24,977 --> 01:24:25,978
<i>Incroyable!</i>

1110
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:28,230
<i>Magnifique!</i>

1111
01:24:28,438 --> 01:24:29,439
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1112
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:30,816
<i>Monsieur, s'il vous plaît.</i>

1113
01:24:32,943 --> 01:24:34,361
- <i>Et voilà!</i>
- Merci<i>, Sammy.</i>

1114
01:24:34,528 --> 01:24:35,529
<i>Et voilà!</i>

1115
01:24:47,874 --> 01:24:49,167
You did this.

1116
01:24:51,461 --> 01:24:52,462
We did.

1117
01:24:57,426 --> 01:24:58,844
Do you have dancing on

1118
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,013
Paradise Island?

1119
01:25:01,179 --> 01:25:02,973
Dancing, yeah. Of course.

1120
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:07,185
But these people are just swaying.

1121
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:11,398
Okay, if you're going to be
fighting the God of War,

1122
01:25:11,565 --> 01:25:14,526
I may as well teach you
how to dance, you poor thing.

1123
01:25:14,693 --> 01:25:17,362
All right, probably without the gun.

1124
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:18,780
<i>Madame.</i>

1125
01:25:21,533 --> 01:25:23,076
If you would.

1126
01:25:23,744 --> 01:25:24,745
Well...

1127
01:25:26,496 --> 01:25:28,707
If I'm going to a gala,
I'll need to know how to dance.

1128
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:30,584
- You're not going to the gala.
- Of course I am.

1129
01:25:30,751 --> 01:25:32,628
- No, you're not.
- Why wouldn't I?

1130
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:34,796
Well, for one, you don't
know how to dance.

1131
01:25:35,339 --> 01:25:37,716
I would argue that they
don't know how to dance.

1132
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:39,176
Be polite, be polite.

1133
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:44,306
All right. So, give me your hand.

1134
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:45,515
Like so.

1135
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:49,436
And I'm gonna put my arm

1136
01:25:49,603 --> 01:25:51,355
around you, like so.

1137
01:25:52,022 --> 01:25:53,982
And we just...

1138
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:55,609
What did you call it? "Sway"?

1139
01:25:55,776 --> 01:25:56,902
Then you just sway.

1140
01:25:57,486 --> 01:25:58,987
You're awfully close.

1141
01:26:01,114 --> 01:26:03,241
That's what it's all about.

1142
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:07,329
I see.

1143
01:26:16,296 --> 01:26:18,548
I haven't heard him sing in years.

1144
01:26:35,065 --> 01:26:37,901
It's, uh... It's a snowfall.

1145
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:43,281
Touch it.

1146
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:47,911
It's magical!

1147
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:50,622
It is, isn't it?

1148
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:54,084
It is, yeah.

1149
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:04,052
Is this what people do when
there are no wars to fight?

1150
01:27:04,761 --> 01:27:05,762
Yeah.

1151
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:10,142
Yeah, this and other things.

1152
01:27:10,308 --> 01:27:11,727
What things?

1153
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:14,646
Um...

1154
01:27:19,151 --> 01:27:20,652
They have breakfast.

1155
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:22,863
They really love a breakfast.

1156
01:27:23,029 --> 01:27:25,574
And, um, they love to wake up

1157
01:27:26,533 --> 01:27:28,744
and read the paper and go to work.

1158
01:27:29,828 --> 01:27:31,580
They get married.

1159
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:33,957
Make some babies, grow old together.

1160
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:35,792
I guess.

1161
01:27:39,755 --> 01:27:41,256
What is it like?

1162
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,762
I have no idea.

1163
01:29:21,731 --> 01:29:23,149
The villagers gave them to us.

1164
01:29:24,067 --> 01:29:26,778
- A gracious gift.
- And they call us heroes.

1165
01:29:26,945 --> 01:29:27,946
You are.

1166
01:29:28,738 --> 01:29:30,532
Hey, fellas. I know that

1167
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:33,451
I said this job was two days,

1168
01:29:35,662 --> 01:29:36,746
and a deal's a deal.

1169
01:29:38,999 --> 01:29:40,500
You'd get lost without us.

1170
01:29:41,418 --> 01:29:42,419
Yeah.

1171
01:29:43,211 --> 01:29:45,005
<i>We all know Diana is capable
of taking care of herself.</i>

1172
01:29:45,589 --> 01:29:47,173
I'm worried that you won't make it.

1173
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:48,633
There's no more money.

1174
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,218
We've been paid enough.

1175
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:52,721
Maybe you're better off without me, yeah?

1176
01:29:53,722 --> 01:29:55,307
No, Charlie.

1177
01:29:56,766 --> 01:29:58,852
Who will sing for us?

1178
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:01,771
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Oh, no, please.

1179
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:03,899
Sing?

1180
01:30:04,107 --> 01:30:05,817
You asked for it.

1181
01:30:05,984 --> 01:30:09,112
<i>Green grow the rashes, O</i>

1182
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:12,991
<i>Green grow the rashes, O</i>

1183
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:16,828
<i>The sweetest hours I e'er did spend</i>

1184
01:30:17,829 --> 01:30:19,998
You must think I was born yesterday.

1185
01:30:20,165 --> 01:30:22,042
I know it sounds crazy, but it's true.

1186
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:23,376
Every word.

1187
01:30:23,752 --> 01:30:25,128
Wait, wait, wait.

1188
01:30:25,295 --> 01:30:27,213
There is a whole island
of women like her?

1189
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:29,174
And not a single man among them?

1190
01:30:30,175 --> 01:30:31,426
How do we get there?

1191
01:30:31,718 --> 01:30:33,678
<i>And she thinks</i>

1192
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:35,889
that Ludendorff is Ares, the God of War?

1193
01:30:36,056 --> 01:30:38,934
And only by killing him will the war end?
Don't be daft.

1194
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:40,518
<i>You saw what happened out there.</i>

1195
01:30:41,019 --> 01:30:43,104
<i>The way she charged
that machine-gun nest?</i>

1196
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:45,065
The way she took out that tower?

1197
01:30:46,566 --> 01:30:47,901
Maybe it's true.

1198
01:30:49,069 --> 01:30:50,403
I think it's true.

1199
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:51,905
I believe it's true.

1200
01:30:52,072 --> 01:30:53,073
<i>Et voilà.</i>

1201
01:30:53,239 --> 01:30:57,035
Steven, son, you don't really
believe this rubbish, do you?

1202
01:31:20,225 --> 01:31:22,560
Diana! Diana!
Hiding, hiding.

1203
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:25,814
How the hell do we get into that?

1204
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:29,651
I see only a couple of guards
on the door to distract.

1205
01:31:29,859 --> 01:31:31,236
Yeah, it won't look suspicious at all

1206
01:31:31,403 --> 01:31:32,904
when I come sauntering
out of the woods on foot.

1207
01:31:33,071 --> 01:31:34,072
I could get in.

1208
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:35,740
You're not going in. It's too dangerous.

1209
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:37,492
- Too dangerous?
- Yes, too dangerous.

1210
01:31:37,659 --> 01:31:38,743
And you're too distracting.

1211
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:41,371
So, look, I'll go in there,
and follow them

1212
01:31:41,538 --> 01:31:43,957
to wherever they're working on the gas
or, better yet, where it is.

1213
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:45,417
- Then I'm coming with you.
- <i>No, you're not!</i>

1214
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:48,420
What you're wearing isn't
exactly undercover.

1215
01:31:48,586 --> 01:31:49,587
I don't know.

1216
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:51,589
I would say she was pretty
undercover on that battlefield.

1217
01:31:51,756 --> 01:31:53,800
<i>We just... We can't get you in, okay?</i>

1218
01:31:53,967 --> 01:31:55,385
So, I'll scout it out, report back, and...

1219
01:31:55,552 --> 01:31:57,429
But as long as he's still alive,
it doesn't...

1220
01:31:57,595 --> 01:32:00,056
You cannot go into German
High Command and kill anyone.

1221
01:32:00,223 --> 01:32:02,100
You just can't. You have to trust me.

1222
01:32:03,435 --> 01:32:05,270
- Oh, wow!
- Where did that come from?

1223
01:32:05,437 --> 01:32:07,480
Oh, can I drive it?
Please, let me drive it!

1224
01:32:07,647 --> 01:32:08,898
I'll be your chauffeur.

1225
01:32:09,065 --> 01:32:10,275
Come on, come on.

1226
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:12,027
Stay put!

1227
01:32:12,861 --> 01:32:13,862
<i>Where did this come from?</i>

1228
01:32:14,029 --> 01:32:16,197
A field over there. It's full of them!

1229
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:21,870
Chief, I say you and me
scope out the area

1230
01:32:22,037 --> 01:32:23,580
in case we need to beat a hasty retreat.

1231
01:32:23,747 --> 01:32:26,124
- What do you say, Diana?
- Huh?

1232
01:32:30,628 --> 01:32:31,838
<i>Colonel.</i>

1233
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,386
Steve, they have invitations.

1234
01:32:39,804 --> 01:32:42,182
Don't worry, play it cool.
You got this. You got this.

1235
01:32:46,478 --> 01:32:47,520
Your invitation, please.

1236
01:32:47,687 --> 01:32:48,688
<i>Dhanyavaad,</i> sahib.

1237
01:32:48,897 --> 01:32:50,482
The colonel and I wish for many blessings

1238
01:32:50,648 --> 01:32:52,734
and all manner of other things
to fall upon your head.

1239
01:32:52,901 --> 01:32:54,444
Your head must be empty.

1240
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:56,529
He wants my invitation, you idiot.

1241
01:32:56,696 --> 01:32:57,864
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1242
01:32:58,031 --> 01:33:00,492
I must apologize a thousand,
thousand times, my master.

1243
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:03,661
I make the most horrible,
the most unforgivable mistake.

1244
01:33:03,828 --> 01:33:04,954
I lost the colonel's invitation.

1245
01:33:05,121 --> 01:33:06,122
What?

1246
01:33:06,289 --> 01:33:09,000
Are you saying we drove all the way
through the mud and rain

1247
01:33:09,167 --> 01:33:10,752
- only for you to lose my invitation?
- I'm a snail.

1248
01:33:10,919 --> 01:33:12,003
No! I'm a bug.

1249
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:14,047
Not even a bug.
I am the dung of a bug!

1250
01:33:14,214 --> 01:33:15,465
And you're right, master...

1251
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:17,509
Blessing be upon us.

1252
01:33:28,228 --> 01:33:29,604
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

1253
01:33:29,771 --> 01:33:31,940
<i>I'm not going to spend
the entire evening out here,</i>

1254
01:33:32,107 --> 01:33:34,192
you stupid idiots! Move your cars!

1255
01:33:55,421 --> 01:33:56,923
What are you supposed to be?

1256
01:34:00,593 --> 01:34:02,220
What are you doing?

1257
01:34:27,036 --> 01:34:28,079
Excuse me.

1258
01:34:30,915 --> 01:34:32,250
I don't drink.

1259
01:34:40,425 --> 01:34:41,593
Have we met?

1260
01:34:41,759 --> 01:34:43,595
No, but I've been watching you.

1261
01:34:44,596 --> 01:34:46,055
Following your career, I mean.

1262
01:34:47,432 --> 01:34:49,934
<i>You are Dr. Isabel Maru.</i>

1263
01:34:50,101 --> 01:34:52,645
The most talented chemist
in the German Army.

1264
01:34:52,812 --> 01:34:54,439
I am a fan.

1265
01:35:05,325 --> 01:35:07,452
I hope I am not crossing a line.

1266
01:35:08,953 --> 01:35:11,372
I know you and General Ludendorff are

1267
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:12,582
very close.

1268
01:35:12,749 --> 01:35:16,002
We work well together. Yes.

1269
01:35:16,836 --> 01:35:19,797
But having someone like me behind you,

1270
01:35:20,465 --> 01:35:22,091
I could provide a lot more.

1271
01:35:22,258 --> 01:35:24,135
And who are you?

1272
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:28,681
A man who would show you appreciation
a genius like yourself deserves.

1273
01:35:35,146 --> 01:35:37,649
I love fire. Don't you?

1274
01:35:40,151 --> 01:35:41,819
It is like

1275
01:35:43,154 --> 01:35:45,281
a living act of entropy.

1276
01:35:45,448 --> 01:35:47,825
The ultimate weapon of destruction.

1277
01:35:48,743 --> 01:35:50,954
Reminding us that, in the end,

1278
01:35:51,454 --> 01:35:54,832
everything eventually returns
to the ash it came from.

1279
01:35:57,335 --> 01:35:59,796
There is something reassuring about it.

1280
01:36:05,093 --> 01:36:07,303
I see all of that in your eyes.

1281
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:13,059
Perhaps you could show me
what you're working on.

1282
01:36:29,117 --> 01:36:30,618
<i>I hear it is...</i>

1283
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:35,123
I hear it is extraordinary.

1284
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:39,585
I appreciate your interest in my work,

1285
01:36:39,752 --> 01:36:42,046
<i>but I am loyal to General Ludendorff.</i>

1286
01:36:42,213 --> 01:36:43,214
<i>Besides,</i>

1287
01:36:43,756 --> 01:36:46,467
now I see your attention is

1288
01:36:49,637 --> 01:36:50,680
elsewhere.

1289
01:37:14,704 --> 01:37:16,581
Enjoying the party?

1290
01:37:18,583 --> 01:37:21,586
I confess, I'm not sure
what it is we're celebrating.

1291
01:37:21,753 --> 01:37:24,505
A German victory, of course.

1292
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:25,673
Victory?

1293
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,051
When I hear peace could be so close.

1294
01:37:28,259 --> 01:37:29,260
Peace?

1295
01:37:29,427 --> 01:37:31,554
There's only an armistice

1296
01:37:31,721 --> 01:37:33,723
in an endless war.

1297
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:35,266
Thucydides.

1298
01:37:35,475 --> 01:37:37,435
Ah! You know your Ancient Greeks.

1299
01:37:37,602 --> 01:37:39,437
They understood

1300
01:37:39,604 --> 01:37:41,939
that war is a god.

1301
01:37:42,106 --> 01:37:43,775
A god that requires human sacrifice.

1302
01:37:43,941 --> 01:37:45,860
And in exchange,

1303
01:37:46,027 --> 01:37:47,779
war gives man purpose,

1304
01:37:48,363 --> 01:37:50,573
meaning, a chance to rise above

1305
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:53,034
his petty, mortal, little self

1306
01:37:53,618 --> 01:37:54,911
and be courageous,

1307
01:37:55,661 --> 01:37:57,163
noble, better!

1308
01:37:58,164 --> 01:38:01,459
Only one of the many
gods believed in that.

1309
01:38:01,876 --> 01:38:04,045
- Mmm.
- And he was wrong.

1310
01:38:05,254 --> 01:38:07,173
You know nothing of the gods.

1311
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:08,549
<i>Herr</i> General.

1312
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:13,012
Enjoy the fireworks.

1313
01:38:18,559 --> 01:38:19,644
What are you doing?

1314
01:38:19,811 --> 01:38:21,187
- Out of my way!
- Diana, look at me.

1315
01:38:21,354 --> 01:38:23,022
If you kill Ludendorff
before we find the gas,

1316
01:38:23,189 --> 01:38:24,399
we won't be able to stop anything.

1317
01:38:24,565 --> 01:38:25,566
I will stop Ares!

1318
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:26,818
What if you're wrong?

1319
01:38:28,486 --> 01:38:30,154
What if there is no Ares?

1320
01:38:31,948 --> 01:38:33,324
You don't believe me.

1321
01:38:33,866 --> 01:38:35,535
I can't let you do this.

1322
01:38:36,119 --> 01:38:37,412
What I do is not up to you.

1323
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:45,294
Diana!

1324
01:38:49,715 --> 01:38:50,967
<i>Diana...</i>

1325
01:38:51,134 --> 01:38:52,218
<i>It's the gas.</i>

1326
01:38:52,385 --> 01:38:54,429
The village... The village!

1327
01:38:57,390 --> 01:38:58,975
What are they cheering for?

1328
01:39:01,519 --> 01:39:02,687
Diana!

1329
01:39:05,106 --> 01:39:06,732
What did they fire?

1330
01:39:06,899 --> 01:39:07,900
The gas.

1331
01:39:08,067 --> 01:39:09,610
- It was Ludendorff.
- I saw him. He was in the tower.

1332
01:39:09,777 --> 01:39:11,946
Wherever he goes, you follow.

1333
01:39:12,530 --> 01:39:13,781
How will you find us?

1334
01:39:14,365 --> 01:39:15,575
I know how.

1335
01:40:33,361 --> 01:40:34,695
Diana!

1336
01:40:37,823 --> 01:40:40,493
They're dead. They're all dead.

1337
01:40:41,327 --> 01:40:42,954
I could have saved them.

1338
01:40:43,287 --> 01:40:45,665
I could have saved them
if it weren't for you.

1339
01:40:45,831 --> 01:40:47,792
You stopped me from killing Ares!

1340
01:40:48,334 --> 01:40:50,461
- No!
- Stay away from me!

1341
01:40:50,628 --> 01:40:51,963
<i>I understand everything now.</i>

1342
01:40:52,129 --> 01:40:53,965
It isn't just the Germans
that Ares has corrupted.

1343
01:40:54,131 --> 01:40:55,299
It's you, too.

1344
01:40:55,925 --> 01:40:57,051
All of you.

1345
01:40:58,177 --> 01:40:59,554
I will find Ares

1346
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:01,347
and I will kill him.

1347
01:41:04,475 --> 01:41:05,476
Diana!

1348
01:41:06,769 --> 01:41:08,020
That smoke,

1349
01:41:09,021 --> 01:41:10,147
<i>it's the Chief!</i>

1350
01:41:10,314 --> 01:41:11,566
He followed Ludendorff.

1351
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:14,652
Follow the smoke!

1352
01:41:40,803 --> 01:41:42,346
Hey! Diana, that way!

1353
01:41:58,738 --> 01:42:00,615
Come on! Let's go!

1354
01:42:22,178 --> 01:42:23,763
<i>What a surprise.</i>

1355
01:42:24,472 --> 01:42:25,681
Strange.

1356
01:42:26,974 --> 01:42:29,143
Unfortunately, I have another matter

1357
01:42:30,436 --> 01:42:31,437
to attend to.

1358
01:42:36,609 --> 01:42:38,903
What are you?

1359
01:42:39,070 --> 01:42:40,321
You will soon find out.

1360
01:43:14,730 --> 01:43:18,442
As magnificent as you are,
you are still no match for me.

1361
01:43:22,613 --> 01:43:24,407
We'll see about that.

1362
01:43:48,681 --> 01:43:50,808
I am Diana of Themyscira,

1363
01:43:52,518 --> 01:43:54,603
<i>daughter of Hippolyta,</i>

1364
01:43:55,479 --> 01:43:57,815
Queen of the Amazons.

1365
01:44:01,068 --> 01:44:03,821
And your wrath upon this world is over.

1366
01:44:20,629 --> 01:44:23,382
In the name of all that
is good in this world,

1367
01:44:23,549 --> 01:44:26,260
I hereby complete
the mission of the Amazons

1368
01:44:26,427 --> 01:44:28,262
by ridding this world of you

1369
01:44:28,429 --> 01:44:29,513
forever!

1370
01:45:36,747 --> 01:45:37,748
<i>Diana?</i>

1371
01:45:43,838 --> 01:45:45,089
Diana!

1372
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:50,511
I killed him.

1373
01:45:52,096 --> 01:45:54,265
I killed him, but nothing stopped.

1374
01:45:56,433 --> 01:45:58,644
You kill the God of War,
you stop the war.

1375
01:45:58,811 --> 01:46:00,896
Exactly what we have to do now.

1376
01:46:01,063 --> 01:46:02,481
We need to stop the gas. Come on.

1377
01:46:02,648 --> 01:46:03,941
No. All of this should have stopped!

1378
01:46:04,108 --> 01:46:05,109
Diana...

1379
01:46:05,276 --> 01:46:07,111
The fighting should have stopped.
Why are they doing this?

1380
01:46:07,278 --> 01:46:09,280
I don't know! I don't know.

1381
01:46:09,446 --> 01:46:11,115
Ares is dead.

1382
01:46:11,282 --> 01:46:13,492
They can stop fighting now.
Why are they still fighting?

1383
01:46:13,659 --> 01:46:15,286
Because, maybe it's them!

1384
01:46:15,828 --> 01:46:16,829
Maybe...

1385
01:46:18,789 --> 01:46:21,417
Maybe people aren't always good.

1386
01:46:22,293 --> 01:46:24,169
Ares or no Ares,

1387
01:46:25,462 --> 01:46:28,841
maybe it's just who they are.

1388
01:46:31,677 --> 01:46:33,053
- Diana...
- No.

1389
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:34,722
Diana, we can talk about this later.

1390
01:46:34,889 --> 01:46:35,973
- I need you to come with me.
- No. No.

1391
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:38,058
After everything I saw, it can't be!

1392
01:46:38,225 --> 01:46:39,685
It cannot be!

1393
01:46:40,311 --> 01:46:42,062
They were killing each other.

1394
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:44,982
Killing people they cannot see.
Children...

1395
01:46:45,149 --> 01:46:46,692
Children!

1396
01:46:46,901 --> 01:46:49,320
No, it had to be him.
It cannot be them!

1397
01:46:49,486 --> 01:46:51,906
Diana, people... I...

1398
01:46:52,072 --> 01:46:53,574
She was right.

1399
01:46:54,158 --> 01:46:55,159
My mother was right.

1400
01:46:55,326 --> 01:46:57,244
She said, "The world of men
do not deserve you."

1401
01:46:57,411 --> 01:46:59,288
They don't deserve our help, Steve.

1402
01:46:59,455 --> 01:47:01,582
- It's not about deserve!
- They don't deserve our help.

1403
01:47:01,749 --> 01:47:03,584
Maybe we don't!

1404
01:47:05,210 --> 01:47:07,463
But it's not about that.
It's about what you believe.

1405
01:47:08,505 --> 01:47:11,342
You don't think I get it after
what I've seen out there?

1406
01:47:13,510 --> 01:47:16,180
You don't think I wish I could tell you
that it was one bad guy to blame?

1407
01:47:17,056 --> 01:47:18,557
It's not!

1408
01:47:20,935 --> 01:47:22,561
We're all to blame.

1409
01:47:22,853 --> 01:47:23,854
I am not.

1410
01:47:25,397 --> 01:47:27,191
But maybe I am!

1411
01:47:31,153 --> 01:47:32,237
Please.

1412
01:47:32,404 --> 01:47:34,198
If you believe that this war should stop,

1413
01:47:34,365 --> 01:47:36,116
if you want to stop it,

1414
01:47:36,283 --> 01:47:38,535
help me stop it right now.

1415
01:47:40,245 --> 01:47:43,082
Because, if you don't,
they will kill thousands more.

1416
01:47:43,707 --> 01:47:45,668
Please, please come with me.

1417
01:47:45,834 --> 01:47:47,378
I have to go.

1418
01:47:52,925 --> 01:47:55,386
I have to go.

1419
01:48:07,231 --> 01:48:08,232
Hey! Hey!

1420
01:48:12,736 --> 01:48:14,154
- Where's Diana?
- We're on our own.

1421
01:48:14,321 --> 01:48:16,782
- What?
- What do you see, Charlie?

1422
01:48:17,491 --> 01:48:19,118
<i>Looks like a bunch of gas bombs</i>

1423
01:48:19,284 --> 01:48:21,912
but I can't see where
they're taking them.

1424
01:48:22,079 --> 01:48:23,414
<i>How are we going to get in there?</i>

1425
01:48:24,081 --> 01:48:26,125
I've got an idea. Come on, guys.

1426
01:48:26,291 --> 01:48:27,418
Come on!

1427
01:48:41,265 --> 01:48:42,808
Who's there?

1428
01:48:55,487 --> 01:48:57,031
Sir Patrick.

1429
01:48:57,781 --> 01:49:02,119
You were right, Diana.
They don't deserve our help.

1430
01:49:03,287 --> 01:49:07,249
They only deserve destruction.

1431
01:49:08,292 --> 01:49:09,710
You...

1432
01:49:11,628 --> 01:49:13,630
You're him.

1433
01:49:17,051 --> 01:49:18,469
I am.

1434
01:49:19,053 --> 01:49:23,974
But I am not what you thought I was.

1435
01:49:44,119 --> 01:49:45,704
What is it?

1436
01:49:46,997 --> 01:49:48,415
The future.

1437
01:49:53,003 --> 01:49:55,172
I am not your enemy, Diana.

1438
01:49:57,007 --> 01:50:00,844
I am the only one who truly knows you.

1439
01:50:01,011 --> 01:50:05,432
And who truly knows them,
as you now do.

1440
01:50:07,851 --> 01:50:11,688
They have always been,
and always will be

1441
01:50:11,855 --> 01:50:15,692
weak, cruel, selfish,

1442
01:50:15,859 --> 01:50:19,029
and capable of the greatest horrors.

1443
01:50:28,372 --> 01:50:29,873
All I ever wanted

1444
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:35,003
was for the Gods to see how evil
my father's creation was.

1445
01:50:36,922 --> 01:50:38,632
But they refused.

1446
01:50:38,799 --> 01:50:40,050
I am Diana of Themyscira...

1447
01:50:40,217 --> 01:50:41,218
So I destroyed them.

1448
01:50:41,385 --> 01:50:43,387
...daughter of Hippolyta,

1449
01:50:43,554 --> 01:50:44,680
and I'm here to complete her...

1450
01:50:53,564 --> 01:50:54,815
The Godkiller...

1451
01:50:57,860 --> 01:50:59,778
My dear child,

1452
01:51:01,155 --> 01:51:03,657
that is not the Godkiller.

1453
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:07,703
You are.

1454
01:51:10,414 --> 01:51:13,417
Only a god can kill another god.

1455
01:51:14,418 --> 01:51:18,338
Zeus left the child he had
with the Queen of the Amazons

1456
01:51:18,505 --> 01:51:20,591
as a weapon to use against me.

1457
01:51:20,757 --> 01:51:22,593
No. You liar.

1458
01:51:24,303 --> 01:51:26,763
I compel you to tell me the truth.

1459
01:51:29,099 --> 01:51:30,809
I am.

1460
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:59,338
I am not the God of War, Diana.

1461
01:51:59,504 --> 01:52:02,216
I am the God of Truth.

1462
01:52:03,508 --> 01:52:05,010
Mankind

1463
01:52:05,636 --> 01:52:07,804
stole this world from us.

1464
01:52:10,474 --> 01:52:14,019
<i>They ruined it, day by day.</i>

1465
01:52:14,186 --> 01:52:18,357
<i>And I, the only one wise
enough to see it,</i>

1466
01:52:20,025 --> 01:52:22,778
<i>was left too weak to stop them.</i>

1467
01:52:23,487 --> 01:52:27,115
<i>All these years, I have struggled alone,</i>

1468
01:52:27,282 --> 01:52:29,201
<i>whispering into their ears.</i>

1469
01:52:29,368 --> 01:52:34,206
<i>Ideas, inspiration for formulas,</i>

1470
01:52:34,998 --> 01:52:36,625
<i>weapons,</i>

1471
01:52:39,127 --> 01:52:41,630
but I don't make them use them.

1472
01:52:42,506 --> 01:52:44,591
They start these wars on their own.

1473
01:52:45,717 --> 01:52:49,513
<i>All I do is orchestrate an armistice
I know they cannot keep,</i>

1474
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:52,224
<i>in the hope they will destroy themselves.</i>

1475
01:52:53,976 --> 01:52:56,019
<i>But it has never been enough.</i>

1476
01:52:57,688 --> 01:52:59,439
Until you.

1477
01:53:01,483 --> 01:53:05,737
<i>When you first arrived,
I was going to crush you.</i>

1478
01:53:06,238 --> 01:53:09,491
<i>But I knew that if only you could see</i>

1479
01:53:09,658 --> 01:53:12,494
what the other gods could not,

1480
01:53:14,871 --> 01:53:19,418
then you would join me,
and with our powers combined,

1481
01:53:19,584 --> 01:53:23,588
we could finally end all the pain,
all the suffering,

1482
01:53:23,755 --> 01:53:26,466
the destruction they bring.

1483
01:53:26,633 --> 01:53:31,930
And we could return this world
to the paradise it was before them.

1484
01:53:33,390 --> 01:53:35,017
<i>Forever.</i>

1485
01:53:37,894 --> 01:53:39,438
I...

1486
01:53:44,109 --> 01:53:46,987
I could never be a part of that.

1487
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:52,868
My dear, I don't want to fight you.

1488
01:53:53,952 --> 01:53:55,329
<i>But, if I must...</i>

1489
01:54:04,796 --> 01:54:06,590
- Steve!
- Come on, let's go!

1490
01:54:07,299 --> 01:54:08,425
<i>Sammy, let's go!</i>

1491
01:54:09,051 --> 01:54:10,719
Get this plane out of here!

1492
01:54:40,665 --> 01:54:45,087
Oh, my dear, you have so much to learn.

1493
01:55:10,195 --> 01:55:12,531
Oh, my God!

1494
01:55:12,697 --> 01:55:13,990
What are we gonna do?

1495
01:55:15,826 --> 01:55:18,036
There's not much we can do,

1496
01:55:18,495 --> 01:55:19,996
if that's who I think it is.

1497
01:55:26,002 --> 01:55:27,921
But we can stop that plane.

1498
01:55:40,976 --> 01:55:43,019
<i>If we can get on the radio,</i>

1499
01:55:43,186 --> 01:55:45,063
we can ask Flying Corps
to shoot her down.

1500
01:55:45,230 --> 01:55:48,358
No. If it crashes, it'll wipe
everyone out for 50 square miles!

1501
01:55:48,525 --> 01:55:49,526
We gotta ground it!

1502
01:55:49,693 --> 01:55:51,528
Bad news. It's on a timer.

1503
01:55:51,695 --> 01:55:54,072
If we ground it here,
it's the same thing.

1504
01:56:01,037 --> 01:56:02,831
Is it flammable, Chief?

1505
01:56:02,998 --> 01:56:06,376
Yeah, she said it's hydrogen.
It's flammable.

1506
01:56:13,425 --> 01:56:15,719
I need you guys to clear
me a path to that plane.

1507
01:56:15,886 --> 01:56:18,096
- No, Steve!
- Hey, Steve!

1508
01:56:19,389 --> 01:56:20,390
Come on!

1509
01:57:03,767 --> 01:57:05,560
Come on! This way! Steve!

1510
01:57:15,946 --> 01:57:17,155
- Go, Steve, come on.
- Go!

1511
01:57:17,948 --> 01:57:19,324
Steve!

1512
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:24,120
- Go, Steve. Come on.
- Run, run!

1513
01:58:02,242 --> 01:58:05,662
Let's see what kind
of god you really are.

1514
01:58:31,855 --> 01:58:34,524
<i>You will help me destroy them, Diana,</i>

1515
01:58:38,653 --> 01:58:40,530
<i>or you will die.</i>

1516
01:58:50,498 --> 01:58:52,751
<i>Come on, come on.
Let's go, go, go!</i>

1517
01:58:54,794 --> 01:58:57,047
- Move it, boys! Now!
- Let's go! Run!

1518
01:59:22,906 --> 01:59:25,617
Is that all you have to offer?

1519
01:59:41,841 --> 01:59:45,762
It is futile to imagine you can win.

1520
01:59:46,554 --> 01:59:48,181
Give up, Diana.

1521
01:59:48,348 --> 01:59:49,349
<i>Guys, I'm out.</i>

1522
01:59:52,352 --> 01:59:53,603
Chief! Anything left?

1523
01:59:53,770 --> 01:59:54,854
I got nothing.

1524
01:59:55,021 --> 01:59:56,064
- Anything!
- <i>No.</i>

1525
02:00:13,998 --> 02:00:15,166
Steve.

1526
02:01:01,546 --> 02:01:02,964
Steve...

1527
02:01:06,468 --> 02:01:08,845
No!

1528
02:01:43,797 --> 02:01:46,090
<i>Yes, Diana!</i>

1529
02:01:46,257 --> 02:01:48,968
<i>Take them all!</i>

1530
02:01:49,135 --> 02:01:52,096
<i>Finally, you see.</i>

1531
02:01:52,722 --> 02:01:55,141
Look at this world.

1532
02:01:56,059 --> 02:01:58,853
<i>Mankind did this, not me.</i>

1533
02:02:00,063 --> 02:02:01,981
<i>They are ugly,</i>

1534
02:02:02,148 --> 02:02:04,234
<i>filled with hatred,</i>

1535
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:05,652
<i>weak,</i>

1536
02:02:05,819 --> 02:02:08,905
<i>just like your Captain Trevor.</i>

1537
02:02:09,072 --> 02:02:11,908
Gone, and left you nothing.

1538
02:02:12,742 --> 02:02:14,911
<i>And for what?</i>

1539
02:02:15,328 --> 02:02:16,621
<i>Pathetic!</i>

1540
02:02:18,456 --> 02:02:19,749
He deserved to burn!

1541
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:34,472
<i>Look at her and tell me I'm wrong.</i>

1542
02:02:43,606 --> 02:02:47,610
<i>She is the perfect example
of these humans</i>

1543
02:02:49,404 --> 02:02:53,199
<i>and unworthy of your
sympathy in every way.</i>

1544
02:02:54,450 --> 02:02:56,953
Destroy her, Diana.

1545
02:02:57,620 --> 02:03:01,040
<i>You know that she deserves it.
They all do.</i>

1546
02:03:04,627 --> 02:03:06,087
Do it!

1547
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:12,468
<i>Diana!</i>

1548
02:03:15,847 --> 02:03:17,265
<i>Diana...</i>

1549
02:03:26,024 --> 02:03:27,025
What?

1550
02:03:28,151 --> 02:03:29,819
I have to go.

1551
02:03:32,530 --> 02:03:33,990
What are you saying?

1552
02:03:34,365 --> 02:03:35,366
Steve,

1553
02:03:36,034 --> 02:03:38,328
whatever it is, I can do it.

1554
02:03:38,494 --> 02:03:39,495
No. No.

1555
02:03:39,662 --> 02:03:41,289
- Let me do it.
- No.

1556
02:03:41,456 --> 02:03:42,999
It has to be me.

1557
02:03:43,166 --> 02:03:44,959
It has to be me.

1558
02:03:45,126 --> 02:03:48,129
I can save today.
You could save the world.

1559
02:03:56,971 --> 02:03:59,599
I wish we had more time.

1560
02:04:00,183 --> 02:04:02,685
What? What are you saying?

1561
02:04:05,355 --> 02:04:06,522
I love you!

1562
02:04:18,534 --> 02:04:19,827
You're wrong about them.

1563
02:04:29,754 --> 02:04:31,506
They're everything you say,

1564
02:04:32,256 --> 02:04:34,008
but so much more.

1565
02:04:34,175 --> 02:04:35,551
Lies!

1566
02:05:01,786 --> 02:05:05,415
They do not deserve your protection!

1567
02:05:07,208 --> 02:05:08,376
It's not about deserve.

1568
02:05:13,256 --> 02:05:15,174
It's about what you believe.

1569
02:05:18,428 --> 02:05:19,929
And I believe in love.

1570
02:05:20,096 --> 02:05:24,392
Then I will destroy you!

1571
02:05:52,295 --> 02:05:53,963
Goodbye, brother.

1572
02:09:26,217 --> 02:09:28,552
<i>I used to want to save the world.</i>

1573
02:09:29,720 --> 02:09:33,474
<i>To end war and bring peace to mankind.</i>

1574
02:09:34,058 --> 02:09:37,895
<i>But then I glimpsed the darkness
that lives within their light</i>

1575
02:09:38,813 --> 02:09:41,148
<i>and learned that inside
every one of them,</i>

1576
02:09:41,732 --> 02:09:43,985
<i>there will always be both.</i>

1577
02:09:44,860 --> 02:09:47,738
<i>A choice each must make for themselves.</i>

1578
02:09:47,905 --> 02:09:51,325
<i>Something no hero will ever defeat.</i>

1579
02:09:53,035 --> 02:09:54,036
<i>And now I know</i>

1580
02:09:54,996 --> 02:09:59,625
<i>that only love can truly save the world.</i>

1581
02:10:01,502 --> 02:10:03,170
<i>So, I stay,</i>

1582
02:10:03,337 --> 02:10:05,506
<i>I fight, and I give,</i>

1583
02:10:08,259 --> 02:10:10,261
<i>for the world I know can be.</i>

1584
02:10:15,016 --> 02:10:16,225
<i>This is my mission now.</i>

1585
02:10:19,603 --> 02:10:20,938
<i>Forever.</i>
