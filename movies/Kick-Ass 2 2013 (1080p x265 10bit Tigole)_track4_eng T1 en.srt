1
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:50,810
<i>A handgun bullet travels
at more than 700 miles per hour.</i>

2
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,106
Hey, whoa. Absolutely not.
No.

3
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:57,854
Mmm-mmm.

4
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:01,938
Look, if you don't wanna do it,
you don't have to do it.

5
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,901
Okay. Good,
I don't wanna do it.

6
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,073
Fine.

7
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,947
Goddamn! I'm alive.

8
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,239
Oh!

9
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,326
Oh, that's amazing!

10
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,832
I know, right. So...

11
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:20,539
Hmm.

12
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:22,712
Ready to go again?

13
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,338
Absolutely not.

14
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,503
Fine.

15
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:29,715
Don't just say "fine" and
then shoot me in the chest.

16
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,471
'Cause it's not cool.

17
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,676
Like at all.

18
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:35,642
Okay. Jeez.

19
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:47,316
<i>I always wondered why no one
tried to be a superhero before me.</i>

20
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,074
<i>It turns out somebody had. Mindy Macready.</i>

21
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,788
<i>After her dad died,
his old partner on the force,</i>

22
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,616
<i>Marcus, became her guardian.</i>

23
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,620
Is that a Pink Pony bag she's wearing?
Nice backpack.

24
00:01:58,702 --> 00:01:59,749
Thanks.

25
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,543
Steal it from a six year old?

26
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:03,878
<i>Marcus dropped her off every day.</i>

27
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:07,173
<i>But as soon as he was gone, so was she.</i>

28
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,423
<i>No one at school found out
because she hacked into the server</i>

29
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,679
<i>and gave herself the award
for perfect attendance.</i>

30
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,896
<i>Hit Girl and Big Daddy
had been the real deal.</i>

31
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,645
<i>Mindy was gonna keep wearing the mask</i>

32
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,230
<i>as long as there were
criminals to take down.</i>

33
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,407
<i>But no matter how many
drug dealers she stopped,</i>

34
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,777
<i>she couldn't stop feeling alone.</i>

35
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,493
<i>Me? I'd given up
being a superhero</i>

36
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,415
<i>because it was way too dangerous.</i>

37
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,331
<i>Only problem, I was dying of boredom.</i>

38
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,662
<i>Like most high school seniors,</i>

39
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,964
<i>I had no idea
what I wanted to do with my life.</i>

40
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,713
<i>Hell, I didn't know what channel
I wanted to watch.</i>

41
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,586
It's just TV, Dave,
not peace in the Middle East.

42
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,179
<i>My best friends Todd and Marty</i>

43
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,803
<i>had no clue
I was the first superhero to go public.</i>

44
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,055
You guys watch
<i>Spider-Man</i> last night?

45
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,723
Is it weird that Aunt May
gets me kinda hard?

46
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,430
Not if you're
a granny-slammer.

47
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,307
<i>They may wear costumes,
but it isn't Halloween.</i>

48
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,150
<i>They're real life superheroes,</i>

49
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,649
<i>and in the two years since
the first ordinary citizens</i>

50
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,401
<i>donned capes and masks,</i>

51
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,403
<i>the movement has started to spread.</i>

52
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,450
<i>I became a superhero
because of Kick-Ass.</i>

53
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,823
<i>Yeah, you just come home from work,</i>

54
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,447
<i>you grab your gear
and you go out on patrol.</i>

55
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,369
<i>Help us make the streets safe.</i>

56
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,543
<i>I inspired all those people
to get off their asses,</i>

57
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,712
<i>and now I was stuck on mine.</i>

58
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:28,255
<i>So that night after dinner,
I decided to get my old costume out.</i>

59
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,884
- Sorry.
- Whoa! Can't you knock?

60
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,678
You know, buddy, it's perfectly normal
for you to touch yourself...

61
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,893
Oh, Jesus, Dad.
Get out!

62
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:42,105
<i>If I was even thinking
about a Kick-Ass sequel,</i>

63
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,807
<i>I had to get serious.</i>

64
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,394
Hey. Hey,
can we chat?

65
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:49,939
Please, Mindy?

66
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,401
Get in the cab.
Meter's running.

67
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:58,197
I wanna team up like Batman and Robin.

68
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,908
Nobody wants to be Robin.

69
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,208
What's wrong with Robin?

70
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,544
Weren't you like Big Daddy's Robin?

71
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,996
Robin wishes he was me.

72
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,873
What I'm trying to say
is we should be partners,

73
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,842
you and me, like the dynamic duo.

74
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,054
I'm in the NFL, Dave.
You play pee-wee.

75
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,094
So? Train me.

76
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,675
I wanna walk the walk,

77
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,432
and you're the closest thing
I know to a real superhero.

78
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,644
Aren't you tired of being on your own?

79
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,901
Don't you wanna know
someone's there for you?

80
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,938
Someone who's got your back?

81
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,871
And you'll do anything I say?

82
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,160
Anything.

83
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,453
Hit me.

84
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,202
You're a 15-year-old girl.

85
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,336
What the hell?

86
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:51,421
Act like a bitch, get slapped like a bitch.

87
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,258
Oh, goddamn.

88
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,729
<i>Mindy beat me like morning wood
every day for three weeks.</i>

89
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,808
Come on. Guard up!
Left, right, guard up!

90
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,280
<i>Even with my damaged nerve endings,
it hurt like hell.</i>

91
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:19,115
<i>But, in a weird way, I kinda liked it.</i>

92
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,411
<i>It gave me a sense of purpose.</i>

93
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,413
- What happened to your face?
- Nothing.

94
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,078
<i>Like we were driving towards something.</i>

95
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,125
Goddamn!

96
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,958
Oh! Oh, that's amazing!

97
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,383
<i>All the other people putting on masks were
just playing superhero.</i>

98
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,426
<i>We were training to really do it.</i>

99
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:39,507
<i>I couldn't tell my girlfriend Katie,
or Marty and Todd.</i>

100
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,138
<i>But I didn't care.
We were having too much fun.</i>

101
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,936
Left, right, left!

102
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,736
<i>Our own superhero team.</i>

103
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,694
<i>It was gonna be balls.</i>

104
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,492
What the hell, Mom?
Did you delete the news off the DVR?

105
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,832
Yes. Yes,
I did, Christopher.

106
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,001
That was the one
with Kick-Ass.

107
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:12,206
Oh, Christopher, you've gotta stop
obsessing over this superhero.

108
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,758
He is not a superhero,
Mom, he's a murderer.

109
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,052
He blew up Dad with a bazooka,
for fuck's sake!

110
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,255
Your father died in a fire.

111
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,556
A fire?
What is your problem?

112
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,510
You! You are my problem!

113
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:28,684
I am trying to raise you to be a normal boy!

114
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:32,609
That's why we moved to Long Island after
your father's accident.

115
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:36,814
A bazooka is not an accident,
you delusional bitch!

116
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,157
This conversation is over.

117
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,905
Great. Then I'm leaving.

118
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,530
Come on, Javier, be cool.

119
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:47,324
Sorry, Chris,
but your mom pays me not to be cool.

120
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:55,965
I hate you!
You home-school me like I'm a prisoner!

121
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,839
You threw away my Red Mist costume.

122
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,717
God! I am not
the problem! You are!

123
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:04,341
I wish you were dead!

124
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,353
Mommy?

125
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,814
Don't touch that.

126
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,024
Oh, I'm sorry.
What is it?

127
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,862
It's a last resort. Like if all else fails
and you're about to die.

128
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,872
Are you not scared to die?

129
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,751
Are you scared you're never gonna grow
into your big boy pants?

130
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,841
I'm serious. What if
Spider-Man or Batman got killed one night?

131
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:38,963
It could happen.

132
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:43,089
If you're scared of dying,
one thing is certain, you are going to die.

133
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,717
My daddy was never afraid of dying.

134
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,594
Look where that got him.

135
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,975
He knew he might have
to make the ultimate sacrifice one day.

136
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,568
And that's why he made me promise

137
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,237
I'd never stop defending this city.

138
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,483
Cross my heart,

139
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,156
hope to die.

140
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:10,499
Your dad was insane.
You know that, right?

141
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:16,964
You're wrong, Dave.
My daddy was the first real superhero,

142
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,793
not you or Red Mist.
It was my daddy,

143
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,463
and it was an honor to serve by his side.

144
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,768
Hey, Min, how was school?

145
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,353
Super crazy.

146
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,945
Miss Mullins was out today,

147
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:44,195
so we had Mr. Cooper
teaching us biology, such a grump.

148
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,948
Oh, really? That's weird because
Principal Himoff called me yesterday.

149
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,532
You were supposed to get an award

150
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,160
for perfect attendance,
but you didn't attend.

151
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,910
I followed you this morning.
Saw you get into a cab with some boy,

152
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,041
and I lost you guys over the bridge.

153
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,964
So now you wanna tell me
where you really were today?

154
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,848
I'm really sorry, Marcus.
I didn't wanna make you mad.

155
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,551
Cut the waterworks, Min.
You're 15, not five.

156
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,644
Okay.

157
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,400
Look, he asked me to cut class
and go to the mall.

158
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,820
So, yeah, yeah, I did.

159
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,406
This has nothing to do
with you being Hit Girl?

160
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,529
I'm not gonna find any ninja blades

161
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,906
or throwing stars under your bed?

162
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:32,201
No. I just wanted him
to like me. Okay?

163
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,788
Sweetie, skipping school's
not a way to get boys to like you.

164
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,585
- I'm so stupid.
- Hey, hey.

165
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:42,131
You're one of the smartest
little girls I know. Let's go get some pizza.

166
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,175
What, you mean I'm not grounded?

167
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,469
Well, just consider this a warning.

168
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:51,015
Hey, you sure you wanna
give all your mom's things away?

169
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,889
What the hell am
I supposed to do with all her stuff?

170
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,100
Damn, she had a nice pair of guns.

171
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,941
Dude, she's dead!
Don't talk about her tits.

172
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,023
I was talking about these.

173
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,821
Oh, those.
Those were my dad's.

174
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,824
Why don't you keep them?

175
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,656
Are you sure?

176
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:11,782
Yeah. I mean,
they belong to you, right?

177
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,740
Come on, Chris.
You're your own man now.

178
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:18,084
- Just be careful, all right?
- Yeah.

179
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,713
Whoa!

180
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,458
Definitely don't wanna keep those!

181
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,758
I'll take care of it.

182
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,140
You take the day off.
Later.

183
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:40,974
Hey.

184
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,277
So, are you ready
for your first field test?

185
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,566
What am I supposed to do with these?

186
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:48,736
Put them on and, uh, go fishing.

187
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,544
I'm the whitest pimp ever.

188
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,878
<i>That's the idea.</i>

189
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,922
<i>Take the next right.
Comes out on Flatbush.</i>

190
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,007
You sure I should be doing
this without my gear?

191
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,175
<i>That's the point.</i>

192
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,095
<i>Kick-Ass isn't a costume.
Kick-Ass is who you really are.</i>

193
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,969
<i>Dave Lizewski is the mask.</i>

194
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:16,392
Well, my "mask" is about to
get his teeth kicked in.

195
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:21,098
Hey, queer bait,
where are you going with those bags, man?

196
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,271
<i>Tell him you're on your way
to fuck his mother with a 12-inch strap on.</i>

197
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,019
I'm just taking a walk.

198
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,151
This really isn't what I do.
I usually just call the cops.

199
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,240
Who are you talking to, man?

200
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,323
Uh, I'm just on a call.
It was...

201
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,121
You know, service round here,
it sucks, man.

202
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,997
Now give me the bags, faggot,
before I make you suck my fat cock, huh?

203
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,835
Come on.

204
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,715
Okay, okay.

205
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,995
<i>Can you believe
I let Mindy beat the snot out of me for weeks</i>

206
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,243
<i>just so I could get my ass kicked again?</i>

207
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,074
<i>So much for a team.</i>

208
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,543
You ready to die?
You faggot!

209
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,751
You know, all that homophobic shit
makes you sound super gay.

210
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,415
Come on, man.
Come on.

211
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,040
If I ever catch you
robbing again, shit-burger,

212
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,710
I'm gonna go Saudi Arabia
on your ass and cut your hand off.

213
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,300
Promise me you're done
with your life of crime.

214
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,718
I promise.

215
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,678
Pants on fire.

216
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,970
- What do you think?
- I think you almost got me killed!

217
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,100
No. What do you
think of my line?

218
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,897
"Pants on fire."
I wrote a whole bunch of 'em.

219
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:30,064
Run! I'll tell them
you saved me. Go!

220
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,778
<i>Female suspect fleeing Flatbush.</i>

221
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,733
<i>Under 5 feet. Masked.
Armed with nunchucks and a sword.</i>

222
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,499
- <i>Hey, Min.</i>
- Hey, Marcus. What's up?

223
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:53,708
<i>I see you answered your phone.</i>

224
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,883
<i>That means you're not in school.</i>

225
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,302
I was,

226
00:13:56,419 --> 00:14:00,469
but I wasn't feeling so good,
and so the nurse decided to send me home.

227
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,763
Poor thing.
Well, I'm almost home.

228
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,807
I'll make soup and we can watch <i>Jeopardy!</i>

229
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,763
All righty.
I'll see you soon, okay?

230
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,938
<i>All right.</i>

231
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,882
Shit!

232
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,324
You got my soup?

233
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,037
Let me take your temperature first.

234
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,915
Oh, you're really clammy.

235
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,791
I'll feel better
after a nap-nap.

236
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,498
Close your eyes.
I'm gonna get you that soup.

237
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,631
Is that blood?

238
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,926
Damn it, Mindy.
I can't do this anymore.

239
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,927
Your father was like a brother to me.

240
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,933
He was a great cop and a hero.

241
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,185
But Big Daddy?
That was not your father, okay?

242
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,269
That was someone
who robbed you of your childhood.

243
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,773
And this?

244
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,819
Hit Girl?
That's not who you are.

245
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:47,865
You are Mindy Macready
and you're just starting high school.

246
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,080
I understand that you don't know
who that person is yet,

247
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,833
but you will, you've just gotta try.

248
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,083
I don't want to.

249
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,380
You don't know what you want.

250
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:59,213
You can't.
You're not an adult, not yet.

251
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,130
Yeah, well, I've done more in my 15 years
than most adults have in their lifetime.

252
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,174
That note that your father gave you,

253
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,976
the one that you were supposed
to open if anything ever happened.

254
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,974
What did it say?

255
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,100
That you would take care of me.

256
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,478
And that you were supposed
to listen to me, right?

257
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:15,683
Well, listen up.

258
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,485
I want you in school.
I want you to stop talking to that boy.

259
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,938
And I want you to promise me

260
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,615
that this is never gonna happen again.

261
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,585
Cross my heart,

262
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:39,628
hope to die.

263
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,256
Good.

264
00:16:58,226 --> 00:16:59,273
<i>Mindy!</i>

265
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,353
What the hell?

266
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,484
First you almost get me killed,
then you stand me up.

267
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,530
Dave, I'm sorry.

268
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,233
I mean, I...
You are?

269
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,109
I am.

270
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,238
For everything.

271
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,414
Oh, okay, great.

272
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:16,624
I mean, "apologetic" isn't a word
I'd use to describe you.

273
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,039
How many times do I have to say it?

274
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,294
Look, let's get out of here.

275
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,843
You gotta ease up.
I think I might have broken a rib.

276
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,420
Dave, I'm done.

277
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,013
With training?

278
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,465
With everything.

279
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,809
Wait, you mean everything?

280
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,102
You can't.
You're Hit Girl.

281
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,396
We were gonna start a team,
you can't just quit.

282
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,318
This is who you are.

283
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,561
Not anymore, Dave.

284
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,150
I'm sorry, but it's over.
I'm done.

285
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,485
She just broke up with him?

286
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,694
Just leave me alone.

287
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,950
Will you stop apologizing?

288
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:56,080
I don't know what's worse,
that you're fucking a 9th-grader

289
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,705
- or that you just got dumped by one.
- Whoa, whoa!

290
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,832
Pedophile freak.

291
00:17:58,995 --> 00:17:59,962
It's not like that.

292
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,584
Then what is it like?
Please, tell me.

293
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,668
I can't. It's to do with the
Kick-Ass thing.

294
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,594
I've got a secret for you.
You remember Malik?

295
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,923
Dude who volunteers
at your needle exchange?

296
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:13,010
His baton is so much
bigger than Kick-Ass'.

297
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,852
- No.
- Yeah.

298
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,767
And by "baton," I mean penis.

299
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,812
Yeah, I got that. Thanks.

300
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,605
Fifteen gets you 20, pervert.

301
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:26,197
A freshman, Dave?
You old, salty dog.

302
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,696
What's the problem?
Grass on the field, play ball. Right?

303
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,778
No, Todd.

304
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:32,987
<i>Chris, your tutor's here.</i>

305
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:34,947
Chris!

306
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,166
Chris, your...

307
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,495
Holy shit.
What the hell is that?

308
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,123
My destiny.

309
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:46,338
Chris, just because your mom liked
to get a little freaky now.

310
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,382
I know what my role is in this, Javier.

311
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,806
My dad was a crime boss,
so it just makes sense.

312
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,310
I'm a supervillain.
It's evolution.

313
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,556
Come on, come on.

314
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,764
Just put those things down before you
hurt somebody, Chris.

315
00:18:58,846 --> 00:18:59,893
That's not my name.

316
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,645
Okay, okay.
Uh, Red Mist...

317
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,520
Red Mist was my superhero name.

318
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,276
Henceforth I'll be known as

319
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,358
The Motherfucker.

320
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,444
<i>After Mindy quit,</i>

321
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,656
<i>I decided to stop hitting the heavy bag
and start hitting the streets.</i>

322
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,909
Hey, Kick-Ass,
welcome back!

323
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,125
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

324
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,911
You're the best, man!

325
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:25,461
<i>Only problem, I was still on my own.</i>

326
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,084
<i>So I went online and
found a physics professor</i>

327
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,169
<i>calling himself
"Dr. Gravity."</i>

328
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,381
<i>Sure, he wasn't Hit Girl,
but I had to start somewhere.</i>

329
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:36,013
This is the zero G device that I invented.

330
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,345
Can levitate any object up to a ton.

331
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,641
For real?

332
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:43,016
Hell, no, man.
This is a baseball bat wrapped in tinfoil.

333
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,646
But it fooled you.

334
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,690
Hey, could I get a Diet
Mountain Dew, please?

335
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,313
I'm not even a physics professor.

336
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:49,943
Just a copywriter for an ad agency.

337
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,029
But that's why I love this stuff.

338
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,281
You can be anyone you want!

339
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,745
You done many
team-ups before?

340
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,290
Kind of. Yeah.
No, not really.

341
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,496
I was getting kinda nervous about
being on my own, you know?

342
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,579
Yeah, me, too.
I never even been in a fight.

343
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,500
Well, hopefully you won't have to.

344
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:12,003
I friended a guy talking about
forming a team, if you're interested.

345
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,721
I don't know how serious he is,

346
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,139
but his picture was pretty hard core.

347
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,392
Are you kidding me?
That's why I contacted you.

348
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,978
I didn't wanna freak
you out by bringing it up too soon.

349
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,522
I'll show you his profile
after I hit the men's room.

350
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,894
Your Uncle Ralph's
not gonna be happy about this, Chris.

351
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,069
That's not my name.

352
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,613
I'm not calling you that, forget it.

353
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,736
Javier, you worked for my dad.

354
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:35,864
Then you worked for my mom.
Now you work for me.

355
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,662
I'm probably the richest kid
in New York City.

356
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,156
But if you don't like that,

357
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,163
find yourself another
motherfucking job, okay?

358
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:45,794
Yo, Kick-Ass!

359
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,331
Man, am I glad to see you.

360
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,003
<i>Is there anything I can do to help, sir?</i>

361
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,760
Yeah. I was hoping you can help me
get a million hits on YouTube.

362
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,847
Come on. Come on.

363
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,033
Run, Kick-Ass, run!

364
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,834
<i>Jersey Shore</i> motherfucker!

365
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,538
Hey, what,
you not interested in a fair fight?

366
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:34,386
That is no fair fight. Team meeting tomorrow.
I'll e-mail you the address.

367
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,884
Beware Dr. Gravity!

368
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:41,017
<i>You had to admire the Doctor's enthusiasm.</i>

369
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,559
<i>I couldn't wait to meet his friends.</i>

370
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,773
Hands in the air, Spring Roll.

371
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:55,106
Empty the register and
don't do anything stupid.

372
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:58,485
Come on! Hey, where are
your security cameras?

373
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,737
- We don't have them. Too expensive.
- Seriously?

374
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,489
- What the fuck? How's this gonna go viral?
- You want to be filmed?

375
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,161
Shut up and just get on the ground!

376
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,707
And you'd better tell people
The Motherfucker was here.

377
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,080
What's wrong with you, boy?

378
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:11,501
Get on the floor, too, Gandalf,

379
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,628
or I will bust a cap in your ass.

380
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,046
You're gonna bust your own face

381
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,877
when that gun kicks
if you don't hold it properly.

382
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,929
Just get on the ground!

383
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:24,260
God, will you hurry up!

384
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,353
I told you.

385
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,532
Go! Go, go, go!

386
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:44,121
Start the car! Go, go!

387
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,949
It was amazing!

388
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:51,379
I feel so alive. I know who I am.
I know why I'm here.

389
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,714
I'm gonna fuck this world up!

390
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,133
They will know The Motherfucker's name!

391
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,379
You've gotta find me some bad-ass
MMA types to train me, okay?

392
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,631
Like a Chuck Liddell or whoever.

393
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,216
Fuck, I don't care how much it costs.

394
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,345
I just wanna be able to
kill Kick-Ass with my bare hands.

395
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,315
I gotta tweet about this.

396
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:34,084
All right.
Are you ready?

397
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,463
Um, I don't know.
Am I?

398
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,301
Yes, you are.
You look great.

399
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,295
And Barbara's daughter,
Brooke, is really nice.

400
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,676
What am I supposed to talk to them about?

401
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,635
I'd rather be water-boarded
than listen to Justin Bieber.

402
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,602
- You're gonna be fine.
- I'm gonna be a disaster.

403
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,266
How do you know that?

404
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:53,020
Because it's a slumber party,
for fuck's sake.

405
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,105
Dollar. Jar.

406
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,616
You're gonna need a bigger jar.

407
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:09,787
Pretty cool, huh?
This is how the beer gets delivered.

408
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,000
Dude. You got a secret elevator
to your underground headquarters.

409
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,169
Yeah. The guy I told you
about owns this place.

410
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,008
It's like
a real-life bat-cave.

411
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:21,586
- I know, right.
- Oh, yeah.

412
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,720
This is the single greatest thing
I've ever seen.

413
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,023
Welcome to Justice Forever.

414
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,490
Hi, Detective Williams.
This must be Mindy.

415
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,904
It is. Hi, Brooke.

416
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,245
You girls have fun and
I'll pick you up in the morning, okay?

417
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:49,614
I'll be the one with the slit wrists.

418
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:52,325
No, you're gonna be
the one that gets the awesome manicure.

419
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,793
- I am?
- Mmm-hmm. Oh, yeah.

420
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:57,379
Say "hey" to Mindy, ladies.

421
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,501
Hey.

422
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,623
I know you.

423
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:02,335
You're that freshman who took a ride on
Dave Lizewski's disco stick.

424
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,631
I did not ride his...

425
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,634
If you just blew him,
you're totes a virgin, right?

426
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:07,181
She didn't blow him, look at her.

427
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,054
Then what? Rim job?
Hand job? Fingerbang?

428
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,477
Sweet-Ryan-Seacrest,
you at least kissed him, right?

429
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:13,978
Totes.

430
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,766
You've never kissed a boy, have you?

431
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,567
Oh, my God, that is so adorable.

432
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,689
Maybe she's a dyke.

433
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,021
Maybe I'll jam my foot up your snatch.

434
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:24,277
Oh, she's super bitchy, I likes.

435
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:26,321
Then what's the big deal anyway?

436
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,778
What could be so great about
gagging on some douche-bag's tongue?

437
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,620
It's pretty fucking great.

438
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:33,742
You know how you feel
when you watch that video by Union J?

439
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,369
Holy shit, you don't know?

440
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,625
This will change your life.

441
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:42,592
<i>Don't ever say you're lonely
Just lay your problems on me</i>

442
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,385
<i>And I'll be waiting
there for you</i>

443
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:49,056
You guys love this shit more than fanboys
love Stan Lee, don't you?

444
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,553
Who's Stan Lee?

445
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:54,057
<i>I'll carry you
I'll carry you</i>

446
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:56,180
<i>I'll carry you</i>

447
00:25:57,056 --> 00:26:00,105
<i>So you know that
I'll carry you</i>

448
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,232
<i>I'll carry you</i>

449
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,484
<i>I'll carry you</i>

450
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,113
<i>Like you've been
running for hours</i>

451
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:10,820
<i>And can't catch your breath</i>

452
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:14,157
<i>The demons are screaming
so loud in your head</i>

453
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,833
<i>You're tired
You're broken</i>

454
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,957
<i>You're cut
and you're bruised</i>

455
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,288
<i>But nothing's too heavy
Just hold on</i>

456
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,377
<i>I'll carry you</i>

457
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:24,583
What the fuck was that?

458
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,339
I know, right?
I'm soaked.

459
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,428
That? That is
who you are, Mindy.

460
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:30,598
You may not dress like us or talk like us,

461
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:33,016
but when it comes to boys,
we're all the same.

462
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:36,099
<i>Twilight.</i> Channing Tatum.
Union J.

463
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:39,523
It's biology, bitch.
Don't fight it.

464
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:43,276
I, um...

465
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,103
I gotta go.

466
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,610
But we were gonna go and
get high on bath salts at Logan's house.

467
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,157
Mindy, I wanna give you a chance

468
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:52,533
that the rest of the girls
in our class would kill for.

469
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:56,328
Don't you wanna walk out the door
every day in skin-tight clothes

470
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,122
knowing that everyone worships you?

471
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:02,455
Don't you wanna sneak out at night,
raise a little hell,

472
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,256
and show the world what a strong,

473
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,210
independent woman is capable of?

474
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,507
Don't you wanna belong?

475
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:13,216
<i>So you know that
I'll carry you</i>

476
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,470
Can I wear this to Logan's?

477
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,597
Yay!

478
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,219
It's gonna be so much fun.

479
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,395
So we tried the cops
and tried the newspapers,

480
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:27,446
and even set up a, you know,
a thing on the Internet

481
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:30,237
for people to help us find Tommy.

482
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,493
Um...

483
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:36,414
But we got nothing.
We never saw our son again.

484
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:40,451
I came up with the name Remembering Tommy,

485
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:43,750
and, uh, we've been doing
this three nights a week. So...

486
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,916
Colonel Stars and Stripes found us online.

487
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:50,427
That's terrible, guys.
I'm real sorry.

488
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:54,094
I became Night Bitch after my sister
was murdered and found in a dumpster.

489
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:55,382
Holy shit.

490
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,138
Doesn't bring her back,

491
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,969
but at least I'm doing
something positive about it.

492
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,396
- Insect Man.
- Yeah, um...

493
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:05,105
I've been bullied
my whole life for being gay,

494
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:08,104
so now I stand up for the defenseless.

495
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,443
That's why I don't wear a mask.

496
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,024
Too much like being back in the closet.

497
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,364
Long as your heart's in the right place,

498
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:16,116
we don't care what you put in your mouth.

499
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,330
- Fist bump.
- Thank you. Thank you, sir.

500
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,574
Well, I became Battle Guy

501
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:24,332
after my parents were mugged and
killed coming home from the opera.

502
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,913
Did I tell you that sick bastard

503
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,748
maxed out their credit
cards on porno sites?

504
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,209
I hope we get the chance
to say hello to this guy someday

505
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:32,966
so I can personally
levitate his soul from his body.

506
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,713
Oh, my God. Marty?

507
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,512
Yeah, I knew I recognized your voice.

508
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:39,806
No, I don't know what you're talking about.

509
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,517
I don't know no Marty.
New guy.

510
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:45,266
Hey, asshole, it's me, Dave.

511
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:49,148
Dave? Why are you
dressed like Kick-Ass?

512
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:51,655
Because I'm Kick-Ass.

513
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:52,898
You two know each other?

514
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,528
Yeah, like since we were five.

515
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:58,366
What's all this bullshit
about your parents getting killed?

516
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,034
- Yeesh, language.
- What?

517
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,829
Battle Guy, care to update your résumé?

518
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,081
Uh...

519
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:07,254
I'm trying to figure out
how to explain this

520
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:10,128
without sounding like
a complete idiot right now.

521
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:12,426
Yeah, I'm not sure that's possible, Batman.

522
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:13,593
I'm not, either.

523
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:15,463
Um...

524
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,092
Okay. Well, when I found
you guys online,

525
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,766
you were all swapping
these awesome origin stories.

526
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,843
I mean, Colonel, you're ex-Mafia,
for Christ's sake.

527
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,014
Yo. Don't take
the Lord's name in vain.

528
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,727
I'm sorry.

529
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:29,898
I didn't think you'd let me join the team

530
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:32,025
unless I had a good story, too.

531
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:36,984
All right, we'll let you off
the hook this time, Battle Guy.

532
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:39,991
- Wanna see something cool?
- Yeah.

533
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,705
I thought this could be our meeting room.

534
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,200
Whoa, this is so cool.

535
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,623
Now this little renovation
was totally clandestine,

536
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:49,876
which means nobody knew about it.

537
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:54,214
Now, I know it's not much,
but this is just the beginning.

538
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,052
Together we can make a real difference.

539
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,220
Whoa!

540
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,015
If you'd consider it,
Kick-Ass,

541
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,888
we'd be honored to have you join us.

542
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,181
Hell, yeah!

543
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:09,896
That's what I like to hear.

544
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,732
Right, time for initiation.

545
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,188
Turn around and I'll unzip you.

546
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,440
I'm sorry, what?

547
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,491
Just joking.
Let's get down to business.

548
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,319
Gotcha.

549
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,492
There you are.

550
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:25,575
We saved you a seat in the caf,
but you never showed.

551
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:28,248
I usually head over
to the Olive Garden to carb load.

552
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,087
I haven't had white sugar
since my first birthday.

553
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,460
Do we need a thintervention?

554
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:35,926
Come on, best way
to tighten up a tummy is varsity dance team.

555
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,303
The sign-up sheet
just went up.

556
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:43,350
It's still blowing
my mind. Kick-Ass.

557
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:44,426
It's like finding out your best friend's

558
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,852
always been Will Smith, you know?

559
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:49,603
Hi, guys. What are you
talking about?

560
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,020
Nothing.

561
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,902
- Nothing?
- Yeah, Todd, nothing.

562
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:57,064
All right.
See you around, guys.

563
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,941
Todd, wait.

564
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,785
- Ow, watch it.
- Watch me end your life.

565
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,161
Come on. Forget it.

566
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,535
Just one of the dickheads that follows
The Motherfucker on Twitter.

567
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:07,582
Who?

568
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,829
The Motherfucker.
He's some guy

569
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:10,411
claiming to be the world's
first supervillain.

570
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,246
He's got 1,000 followers already.

571
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:13,376
What an asshole.

572
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,625
- Get some!
- Uh-huh! Yeah!

573
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,593
You got this, Motherfucker!

574
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,295
You really think he's got a shot?

575
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,097
I wouldn't take his money if I didn't.

576
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:23,845
MMA is like chess.

577
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:27,178
It's all about the moves.
And your boy really knows his stuff.

578
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,269
Time to die, asshole.

579
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,148
- You all right?
- I'm cool. Ow!

580
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:39,448
Good job.
Nice jab, buddy.

581
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:41,992
Come on, stay loose, baby.
Walk it off, walk it off.

582
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,699
- Oh!
- Shit!

583
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,155
Oh, you broke my leg!

584
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,411
- Come on. Do something.
- Let's take a break.

585
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,867
Yeah, yeah, let's take a break, guys.
Come on.

586
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,167
Street rules, bitch!

587
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,332
Chuck! Get this girl off me!

588
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,585
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing, man?

589
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,261
You all right, Chris?
You all right, buddy?

590
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,088
Get off me!
I was winning.

591
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,673
No, you were crying.

592
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:09,228
You know what?
Screw this. My super power

593
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,063
is that I'm rich as shit.

594
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:13,857
Hey, you wanna work for me, huh?

595
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,693
You wanna beat people up for me?

596
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,645
- Sure.
- All right!

597
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,446
Let's get you a mask and a costume,

598
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:23,822
and we will call you Black Death.

599
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,200
Whoa, whoa, you don't think
that's just a little bit incredibly racist?

600
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,446
I don't give a shit.

601
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,952
I want you to put the word out

602
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,704
that I'm willing to pay top dollar

603
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,000
for every hired hitter in town.

604
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,248
Come on, come on.
Just talk about it first.

605
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,374
Money talks.

606
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:37,710
You wanted me to be my own man.

607
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,257
This is what it looks like.

608
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,711
- All right, all right, I'll make some calls.
- Yes!

609
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:45,589
Anybody else wanna be a supervillain?

610
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:48,183
Promise I pay better than
Chuck-little-dick-Liddell.

611
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:49,851
- What did you call me?
- No, no, man.

612
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,928
He took a hit to the head.
Doesn't know what he's saying.

613
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:55,725
I've been studying
privately with Coach Podell.

614
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:59,604
And by studying, I mean my mom
paid her off to make me varsity.

615
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:03,403
So, if you're half decent,
I'll make sure she puts you on the team.

616
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,025
At least as an alternate.

617
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,735
You'd do that for me?

618
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:09,196
Besties stick together.

619
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:12,412
If Brooke wants a pet,
she should just get a dog.

620
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,751
She's just trying to recreate
Mindy in her own image.

621
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,912
All right, ladies, have a seat.
Let's get started.

622
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,786
Mindy Macready?

623
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:05,257
Chill. As long as you don't fall
on your face, you're in.

624
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:06,920
Go.

625
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,022
Four attackers.

626
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,605
No escape.

627
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,126
Oh, my God.
You could totally make captain.

628
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,044
That was so much better than Brooke's.

629
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,497
Oh, my God.

630
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,457
Brooke doesn't stand
a chance for captain after that.

631
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:28,544
<i>A bunch of people
with made-up names</i>

632
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,971
<i>standing around in homemade costumes,</i>

633
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:33,799
<i>searching the web for unsolved crimes.</i>

634
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:36,556
<i>The comic book heroes
all have billion-dollar bases</i>

635
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:39,850
<i>and headquarters on the moon,
but this is the real world.</i>

636
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,394
- ...scales, like a red, white and blue.
- It's awesome.

637
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,188
- What's that?
- Brick.

638
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,356
Right.

639
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,064
- What do you think?
- I think it does the job.

640
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,652
<i>People should get what they deserve.</i>

641
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,485
<i>Family living in the street
deserves a hot meal.</i>

642
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,080
An inebriated college girl
deserves to make it home safe at night.

643
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,999
And a pervert, pedophile,

644
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,170
deserves a visit from Eisenhower.

645
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,754
Schwantz!

646
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:07,423
Ouch.

647
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,046
You don't wanna hit with your closed fist.

648
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,344
You might break your hand,
then you're defenseless.

649
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:15,049
You wanna hit with open palm and pivot.
Open palm and pivot.

650
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,220
Grab the back...

651
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,098
<i>I never made varsity football</i>

652
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:21,096
<i>or got cast in the school play.</i>

653
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,432
<i>Hell, I never even made honor roll.</i>

654
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,770
Knock out, bitch!

655
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:29,521
<i>But if I had, I gotta believe it
would've felt a lot like this.</i>

656
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:32,862
When the cops can no longer
protect and serve,

657
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,656
be warned, mugger, heads up, perv.

658
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:38,200
We got the strength, we got the nerve

659
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,824
to give those in need what they deserve!

660
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,951
Justice Forever!

661
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:46,496
<i>We were in the ultimate clique.</i>

662
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,715
<i>It didn't matter that no one else knew.</i>

663
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,714
<i>We knew.
And we felt like rock stars.</i>

664
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,963
- Good night, guys.
- Nice job. Battle Guy.

665
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,720
Night, Colonel.
Thanks for everything.

666
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,180
No, son, thank you.

667
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:03,017
You showed us that every man
can make a difference.

668
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:06,312
Without Kick-Ass,
none of us would be here.

669
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,903
That's from the heart.
Don't let it go to your head.

670
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,023
So...

671
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,403
I'm not really that tired.

672
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,079
Mmm.

673
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:30,291
Mmm-mmm?

674
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:31,916
Mmm. Okay.

675
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,002
Let's leave the masks on.

676
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:36,213
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

677
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:37,468
Yeah!

678
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,552
<i>First big mission's tonight</i>

679
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,350
and it's not community service.

680
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,898
We're taking on some real bad guys.

681
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,767
What, can't your team handle it?

682
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:50,565
They're not you, Mindy.

683
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,438
Remembering Tommy
owns a dry fruit business.

684
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,864
Night Bitch teaches ballet.

685
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,449
Night Bitch?

686
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:59,243
What is she?
A superhero or a soft core porno?

687
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,328
Maybe a little bit of both.

688
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:04,666
Oh, God, you're plugging her?

689
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,706
I'm gonna vom.

690
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,123
You're like a ninja.

691
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:11,503
Can't you just sneak out
after Marcus goes to sleep?

692
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,292
You don't get it, Dave.

693
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,462
I made a promise to Marcus.

694
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,298
So break it.
You're a superhero, remember?

695
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,017
Mindy Macready's just a disguise.

696
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:26,183
Yeah, well, I don't know
what kind of superhero Night Whore is,

697
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,023
but if you really think
I'd ever break my word,

698
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,691
you obviously have no idea who I am.

699
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:33,403
I know that making dance team doesn't
make you stop being who you are.

700
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,529
I know Hit Girl couldn't give a shit

701
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,073
about what high school girls are into.

702
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:40,736
I know that you wouldn't
go on a date if your life depended on it.

703
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:41,994
Go to hell, Dave.

704
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,993
What? You know I'm right.

705
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,329
Hey! Roid Rage.

706
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,918
- Me?
- Yeah.

707
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,499
You wanna take me on a date sometime?

708
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,626
Uh, yeah.
Sure. Um...

709
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:56,092
My name's, um, Simon.

710
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,670
Great, um, Simon.

711
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:00,846
It's a date.

712
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:03,345
Mindy, I'm sorry.

713
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,516
Is there a problem, Min?

714
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:05,639
Zero.

715
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,639
Good. Because
I don't like problems.

716
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,017
<i>Dave, you been sneaking out at night?</i>

717
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,184
Mrs. Neipert said

718
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:15,236
she thought she saw
you leaving at 2:00 in the morning.

719
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,776
Miss Neipert's crazy, Dad.

720
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,029
She tried to teach her dog Spanish.

721
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,449
Are you on drugs?

722
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:24,953
Seriously?

723
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,201
I gotta ask.

724
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:29,667
You're my best bud and
you're growing up so fast.

725
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:32,541
Promise me you're not doing
anything foolish?

726
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,165
Yeah, I promise.

727
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,296
Good enough for me, pal.

728
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:41,509
You're too smart to do anything stupid.

729
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:45,801
Justice Forever!

730
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:48,683
I'm glad you got that out of your system.

731
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:53,774
Oh, Todd texted me.
Again. What a loser.

732
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:57,149
Dude, how bad-ass is
Colonel Stars and Stripes?

733
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,572
Yeah, I still can't believe
he's an ex-mob enforcer.

734
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,945
I mean, how do you go from
that to being a superhero?

735
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:03,277
He's a born-again Christian.

736
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,611
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

737
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,369
Let's hope he can handle tonight.

738
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,503
I guess we're about to find out.

739
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,344
Hey. Where's the rest
of the team?

740
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,221
Dr. Gravity has the flu,

741
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,550
and Remembering Tommy got
<i>Book of Mormon</i> tickets, so...

742
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,226
That's okay.

743
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,095
Five of us should do.

744
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:32,772
How did you say this guy
made his money, sir? Prostitution?

745
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:37,611
Not just girls. Kids.
Ships them in from villages back home.

746
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,687
Boneheads in blue take a blind eye.

747
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,697
How do you know he's here tonight?

748
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,992
Because Thursday night is poker night.

749
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,736
Same five low-lifes
every week.

750
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,446
Man with a habit ain't hard to find.

751
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,282
So what's the plan?
Are we sneaking in?

752
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,750
I thought we'd knock.
It's more polite.

753
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,077
What?

754
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,746
Stay frosty, team.

755
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,337
I used to eat punks
like this for breakfast.

756
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:03,711
Jehovah's Witness!

757
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,189
I'm sorry, I just zoned out for a second.

758
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,689
Did you say that
we're going up against five gangsters?

759
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,361
And bouncer makes six.

760
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,449
And three-quarters.

761
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:31,657
What the fuck do you want?

762
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:34,955
Good evening, young man.
We'd like a word with Jimmy Kim.

763
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,419
If it's not too inconvenient.

764
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:43,669
Get the fuck out of here
before I tear your head off, you old fuck.

765
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:45,920
I'm sorry.

766
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,431
I think we're in trouble.

767
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,808
I just don't understand
why people feel the need

768
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,802
to use that kind of language.

769
00:41:57,807 --> 00:41:59,024
Whoa!

770
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,443
There he goes.

771
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:05,069
Oh, sweet Jesus.

772
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:09,574
Battle Guy, what did I tell you
about taking the Lord's name in vain?

773
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:10,778
Sorry, sir.

774
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,281
Eisenhower, at the ready.

775
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:14,950
Insect Man, I want you right behind me.

776
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:17,456
Everybody else spread out,
catch the strays.

777
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:18,794
Oh.

778
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:22,966
And try to have fun,
otherwise what's the point?

779
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,962
Nice party.
Anybody wanna dance?

780
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:35,603
Where are you going?

781
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,569
- Very nice.
- Behind you!

782
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,400
Watch the birdie.

783
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,152
Whoo!

784
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:58,784
Don't you move.

785
00:42:58,868 --> 00:42:59,915
Night Bitch!
Behind you!

786
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,084
Wait.

787
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:09,004
Look out!

788
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,847
Okay, I got his right arm.

789
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,113
You know, you shouldn't talk
with your mouth full.

790
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,691
It's very rude.
Come on.

791
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,527
Who the hell are you?

792
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:35,412
We're the good guys.

793
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:38,287
Oh, no, you're the fucking dead guys.

794
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,666
Eisenhower! Schwantz!

795
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,752
Oh!

796
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,130
Ow!

797
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:53,214
Where are the girls?

798
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,675
Come on, man.
I've got a heart problem.

799
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:56,850
Oh, yeah?

800
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:58,678
No.

801
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,434
Do you want me to solve that for you?

802
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:02,436
Whoa, whoa!

803
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,897
Okay.
The girls are upstairs in the apartments.

804
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:10,239
My little brother, he's on the till.
He's just a college kid.

805
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:12,116
- Kick-Ass, Night Bitch.
- On it.

806
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:15,237
Ralph D'Amico is gonna end you for this.

807
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,738
Ow! It hurts!

808
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:20,083
Yeah, there's a dog on your balls.

809
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,954
You want money?
There's 50 grand on the table.

810
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,923
Please just make him stop! Please!

811
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:31,253
You think you can buy us?
Is that what you think?

812
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,550
We're not here to steal from you.

813
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:38,685
We're here to send a message to all
the other bottom-dwellers.

814
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,930
- We're shutting you down.
<i>- Come on.</i>

815
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:44,766
There's a van waiting outside
from a battered women's shelter.

816
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:47,193
It'll take you some place safe.

817
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:49,316
- Go. Go.
- We really can't leave.

818
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:51,189
We have no money.

819
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,108
Battle Guy,
how much they have on the table?

820
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:56,152
Oh, it's like 50 grand.

821
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:58,029
You got plenty now.

822
00:44:58,154 --> 00:44:59,622
Thank you.

823
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:11,960
<i>Good job, guys.</i>

824
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:14,546
Very tidy. Very tidy.

825
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,640
I can't believe you pulled
a gun on that guy.

826
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:19,391
Were you really gonna shoot him?

827
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:21,390
Let you in on a little secret.

828
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,644
Empty.
Don't tell the bad guys.

829
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:29,899
Pardon my language, Colonel,
but you have got some serious balls.

830
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:32,238
Certainly more than Mr. Kim.

831
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,736
"There's
a dog on my balls."

832
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:38,869
God damn it.

833
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,322
- Javier!
- What happened?

834
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,954
Some douche just posted
a link to a story about a whorehouse,

835
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:46,035
says that Kick-Ass'
team took them out.

836
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:47,836
What the hell?
Where's my crew?

837
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:49,126
Chris, everybody's just...

838
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:53,794
Uh, can you ladies excuse us for a second?

839
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:55,135
Uh, no, they're my sidekicks.

840
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:56,588
They can listen to what we have to say.

841
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:57,713
They're not your sidekicks, Chris.

842
00:45:57,797 --> 00:46:00,050
They're prostitutes and witnesses, come on.

843
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,017
All right.
Sorry, no offense.

844
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:05,851
Everybody's just too afraid of
your Uncle Ralph to take the job.

845
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:06,977
But he's in prison.

846
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:09,150
Doesn't matter.
He runs the family now.

847
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:11,520
And he wants everybody to lay low.

848
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:12,941
But, fortunately for you,

849
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,523
Big Tony doesn't know
how to lay low, so he's in.

850
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:17,992
- I don't remember a Big Tony. Is he huge?
- He's ironic.

851
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:21,617
<i>5 foot 4, but mean as shit.</i>

852
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,707
<i>He's got such a hard-on
for killing people.</i>

853
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:32,340
- He's little and he kills.
- Right.

854
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:34,379
Call him "The Tumor."

855
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:35,584
<i>Who's next?</i>

856
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:38,797
<i>All right, we've got,
uh, an ex-Triad member looking for work.</i>

857
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,847
Easy, "Genghis Carnage."
Come on.

858
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:44,556
You gotta quit with
the racist stereotypes, Chris.

859
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,637
Archetypes.
Keep going.

860
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,764
We got, uh, Katarina Dumbrovski.

861
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:49,974
Wait, wait. A chick?

862
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:51,100
<i>Yeah.</i>

863
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,605
<i>Seriously, you hired a chick?</i>

864
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:57,444
<i>Yeah. Former KGB. She was locked up
in the Gulag until she ate her cellmate.</i>

865
00:46:57,565 --> 00:47:00,193
Okay. "Mother Russia."

866
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:03,658
Mother Russia and Motherfucker
both on the same team?

867
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:04,830
That doesn't work, Chris.

868
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,703
I am not asking for suggestions, asshole.

869
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,956
Just get them costumes and get them ready!

870
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:11,503
Shit.

871
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:13,422
Javier, thank you.

872
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,463
I couldn't do this without you.

873
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:20,714
You're pretty much like the only
real family I have left.

874
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,716
Not a problem, man.
I got your back.

875
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:27,562
It's kinda like you're the Alfred
to my evil Bruce Wayne.

876
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,351
Did you just call me your fucking butler?

877
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:31,224
Yeah, is that not a compliment?

878
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,602
Shit. My bad.

879
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:40,150
<i>There wasn't much action most nights.</i>

880
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:43,736
<i>I mean, there was
always a little action with Night Bitch.</i>

881
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:49,792
<i>The reality of being
a superhero is lots of patrols.</i>

882
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,250
<i>But that didn't stop people
from begging to join up.</i>

883
00:47:56,374 --> 00:48:00,379
<i>With all our new members,
it seemed kinda shitty not to ask Todd.</i>

884
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,758
Stop peeking, man, you're gonna ruin it.

885
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,886
Check it out.

886
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:12,356
You can't fight crime in that.
Your pants are so tight, you got frog-eye.

887
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:14,020
What the hell's "frog-eye"?

888
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,727
- Male camel toe.
- What?

889
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:20,316
I'm not really sure about these names, either.
"Whup-Ass," "Kick-Ass-Man."

890
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,699
- "Dr. Kick-Ass"?
- Yeah.

891
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:25,821
Yeah, they all kinda seem derivative.

892
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:27,242
Let me translate that.

893
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,949
You can't just copy Dave's name,
you knob-gobbler.

894
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:32,122
Okay. Um...

895
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,036
Uh...

896
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,214
Oh, wait. Oh, I got it.

897
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:37,672
I got it. I got it.

898
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,173
"Ass Kicker."

899
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:44,134
Seriously?

900
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:45,465
You're such a dick, Marty.

901
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:47,095
I know this is why you guys aren't
texting me back,

902
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,266
I'm not an actual idiot.

903
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,515
Well, you could have
fooled me, Ass-Licker.

904
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,890
- Yeah, well, screw you guys.
- Todd...

905
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,850
No, really.
Fuck you guys.

906
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,185
I'm gonna go find my own team.

907
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,811
Todd. Wait. Come on.

908
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:03,650
<i>Todd was right, we were being dicks.</i>

909
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,109
<i>But the truth is, the only person</i>

910
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:08,071
<i>I really wanted on the team was Mindy,</i>

911
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:11,707
<i>but she was too busy
trying not to be a superhero.</i>

912
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,042
Okay, Min, he's here.

913
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,382
Your first big date.
How are you feeling?

914
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:25,467
Like the first time Big Daddy sent me into

915
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:28,220
a crack den with nothing but a penknife.

916
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:31,097
I've got some butterflies.

917
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:35,307
You just be yourself
and you let me be nervous.

918
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:39,061
Don't worry about me.
I can kill a man with his own finger.

919
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:42,192
A word of advice, I wouldn't open with that.

920
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,653
Thanks for letting me finally take you out.

921
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:49,908
Well, uh,

922
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:53,245
how else was
I gonna get you to stop calling?

923
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:55,576
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

924
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,014
Where are we going?

925
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,262
To a party.

926
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:14,227
Why is this party in the middle of nowhere?

927
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:17,603
Because that's where
keg parties usually are, right?

928
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:32,659
Guess we're the first ones here.

929
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,329
This isn't where you have a party, moron.

930
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,829
This is where you dump a dead body.

931
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:38,498
What's your problem?

932
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:39,749
I'm sorry.

933
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:43,378
I'll stop being such a bitch.

934
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,754
You actually seem like a nice guy.

935
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:48,087
So, um...

936
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,593
You wanna hook up?

937
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:51,890
And a total idiot.

938
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,888
Simon, get back in the car.

939
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:58,731
Now!

940
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:10,117
Yay, you made it.

941
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:11,744
Brooke?

942
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:15,248
This is to celebrate you.

943
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,412
Celebrate?

944
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,493
What a total loser you are.

945
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,747
And we ditch losers.

946
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,884
Poor Mindy.
What did you think?

947
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:29,837
The cool kids saw something special in you

948
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,389
and invited you to your first party

949
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,425
where you'd sip your first beer

950
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:37,478
and finally suck face for the first time?

951
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:41,019
Newsflash, you're not special.

952
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:47,112
Fuck with the queen bee
and you're gonna get stung.

953
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,862
Date ditch.

954
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:52,989
Party at my house!

955
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,160
Pathetic.

956
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:56,580
Simon, you can drive us.

957
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,210
Dave?

958
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:49,842
Oh, my God! Mindy?
Holy shit. What are you doing?

959
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:54,259
Just needed to see my Robin, I guess.

960
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:59,097
Are you okay?

961
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,512
Hey, hey, hey.

962
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:08,027
I don't know what to do.

963
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,270
Those girls, they're...

964
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:12,986
They're evil.

965
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,818
It's just high school.
Who gives a shit?

966
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:19,405
You should be out there in the
real world making it a better place.

967
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:21,699
Dave, I can't.

968
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:23,534
I know, you promised your dad.

969
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,163
But he's not here anymore.

970
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:31,800
This is your life.
You've gotta live it.

971
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:36,092
How am I supposed to face them tomorrow?

972
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:38,678
I'm so embarrassed.

973
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:39,758
Why?

974
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:44,313
You're smart.
You're beautiful. You're funny.

975
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:50,437
You're the strongest person
I've ever met. You can do anything.

976
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:52,651
And you're Hit Girl.

977
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:56,238
Doesn't matter if you're
wearing a mask or makeup,

978
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,784
it's who you really are.

979
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:02,285
So what should I do?
Cut their tongues out?

980
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:03,866
No! Definitely not.

981
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,417
I'm fucking with you.

982
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,756
Just beat them at their own game.

983
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,959
By being yourself.

984
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:24,853
<i>Well, if you really wanna be popular,</i>

985
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:29,017
consider two little words,
"sex," "tape."

986
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:48,327
Lois, you don't need these ax wounds.

987
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,913
If I can dress like them, so can you.

988
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:55,255
It's a gift from some drug dealer
who went missing.

989
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:58,386
Just because you dress like us,

990
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,468
doesn't mean you can be like one of us.

991
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:04,052
It doesn't matter what costume I wear,
yours or mine,

992
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:07,020
I'm a superhero.
That's who I am.

993
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,105
Okay,
Captain Muffin-Muncher,

994
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:10,808
have fun playing
make-believe.

995
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:11,938
This?

996
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,644
This is all make-believe,
Brooke.

997
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:16,230
The reality is you're an evil bitch

998
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:18,733
who's just as bad as
the worst criminal scum.

999
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:22,950
You wanna get real, Mindy?
In the real world, I win.

1000
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:26,165
I go to an awesome college,
I marry a hot guy

1001
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,412
and I make adorable

1002
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:30,961
babies for my nanny
to take care of while we vacay in Paris.

1003
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:34,833
My life is gonna rock
and yours is gonna suck.

1004
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:37,130
And no matter how slutty you dress,

1005
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:40,755
no boy is ever gonna wanna kiss
that hole you call a mouth.

1006
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:44,224
So why don't you spare us
all the whining and slit your wrists now?

1007
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,014
'Cause the only thing
that's gonna ruin my day

1008
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:48,892
is looking at your face one more second.

1009
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,102
- Told her.
- Damn.

1010
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:55,019
What's that?
A ghetto cell phone?

1011
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:58,447
- Gonna call for help with a come-back?
- Hmm.

1012
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:02,743
Actually, my daddy bought this from
a disgruntled DARPA employee.

1013
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:05,864
You see, it was designed for crowd control,
but deemed too severe.

1014
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:09,993
It emits a pulse that
creates spontaneous nausea and diarrhea.

1015
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:12,623
He called it
"the sick stick."

1016
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:14,587
Either your daddy got ripped off,

1017
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:16,961
or you're back in make-believe land,
sweetheart,

1018
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:19,635
because we feel fabulous.

1019
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,295
Not for long.

1020
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:32,018
Oh, my God!

1021
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:36,151
You get away from me.
Please, you win.

1022
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,820
I don't wanna win. I just want to make
the world a better place.

1023
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:56,501
Dad?

1024
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:59,257
You home? Dad?

1025
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:03,428
Is this what you've been up to

1026
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,722
while I'm out working nights
saving for your college?

1027
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,137
You've been dressing up
and fighting people?

1028
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:11,060
There is blood on these stick things.

1029
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:13,730
What are you doing in my room?

1030
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:15,682
I was looking for drugs.

1031
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:16,813
I was worried about you.

1032
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:18,064
Okay, good.
Now you can stop.

1033
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:19,986
No. Now I'm even
more worried.

1034
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:22,110
Jesus, Dave, drugs would have been better.

1035
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:23,862
This is deranged.

1036
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:25,864
Whoa. Some people
do a lot worse.

1037
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,778
- Oh, the people you hang out with?
- No.

1038
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:30,114
The people I hang out with are superheroes.

1039
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:32,291
There is no such thing, Dave.

1040
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:35,210
This is the real world
with real consequences.

1041
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,628
When are you gonna grow up?

1042
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,376
If it means turning into you, never.

1043
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,791
I don't wear the mask
because I'm ashamed of who I am.

1044
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,876
Not like you.

1045
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:44,879
What's that supposed to mean?

1046
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:47,306
If you're not at work,
you're here doing crunches.

1047
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,265
Why? So you can
look like someone else?

1048
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:51,560
Maybe get a few more years
of doing nothing?

1049
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:53,808
Your life has no meaning, Dad.

1050
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,560
When you're gone, who's gonna notice?

1051
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:56,640
Where the hell are you going?

1052
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,818
Oh, uh, I'm leaving.
That's what you do when you grow up.

1053
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:09,904
Did he say why he wanted to see me?

1054
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:12,706
When your Uncle Ralph calls,
I don't ask questions.

1055
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,128
Just the kid.

1056
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:22,417
Chris, just be cool and you'll be fine.

1057
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:28,805
<i>Hey, how you doing?</i>

1058
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,177
Good, Uncle Ralph.

1059
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:33,932
Listen, Chrissy, things have been tough
all around since your dad,

1060
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:35,103
you know.

1061
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:39,107
Well, I been trying to get
the family back on track from in here.

1062
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:40,984
They record these things.

1063
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,436
I know, it's fine.

1064
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:45,196
The warden's a pal.
Now listen to me.

1065
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:46,735
It's okay to have a bit of fun,

1066
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:48,943
but you can't go hiring
a gang of heavy hitters.

1067
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:51,028
Javier should have told you.

1068
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:52,533
No, it doesn't matter.

1069
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:56,625
Uncle Ralph, I am gonna make
Kick-Ass pay for what he did to us.

1070
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,670
Chrissy, you need to forget that punk.

1071
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:01,622
It's more important
that you stay out of this.

1072
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:04,967
You're not like me,
or your dad, you're, uh...

1073
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,131
Special.

1074
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:14,177
You can't tell me what to do anymore.

1075
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:17,145
I know who I am now.

1076
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,312
Oh, yeah?

1077
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,724
And who's that?

1078
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,184
The Motherfucker.

1079
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:30,109
You think you're the big bad guy, huh?

1080
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:35,038
Let me show you what real evil looks like.

1081
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:45,965
<i>Hello?</i>

1082
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:48,551
Javier, what's going on?

1083
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:50,261
Chris, what's up?

1084
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:51,839
What are you doing on Lou's phone, huh?

1085
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,803
<i>Drop yours in the toilet again?</i>

1086
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:55,099
Everything okay?

1087
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:22,411
Thank you for that.
I needed it.

1088
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:25,292
For what comes next.

1089
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:26,840
Don't be stupid, Chris.

1090
01:00:26,915 --> 01:00:30,135
Just get out of town for a while.
Go to college or something.

1091
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:33,760
Why? You just taught me
everything I needed to know.

1092
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,647
<i>Voila!</i>

1093
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:48,570
Presto and elegant, damn.
Them boys designed a very tasty logo.

1094
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:55,782
What's the matter, girl?
You hear something?

1095
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,743
Come on, let's go see.
Come on!

1096
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,663
Anybody out here?

1097
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,924
I don't see anything.

1098
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:14,839
Gonna have to stay in there
until you calm down, you lunatic.

1099
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:21,477
I wonder what's bothering you.

1100
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:24,936
I know. Tonight you die.

1101
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:28,143
Ladies first.

1102
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:29,978
You will not shoot me.

1103
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:34,821
You are superhero.
You help people. You do not hurt them.

1104
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:37,698
That's supervillain territory.

1105
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,199
Or as I like to call my little gang,

1106
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:40,698
the Toxic Mega-Cunts.

1107
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,123
Hi.

1108
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:50,544
Yeah, like your head.

1109
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:02,761
Yay!

1110
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:04,471
Ooh, it's gotta hurt!

1111
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:20,487
I did my homework on you, Colonel.

1112
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:23,498
You used to be Sal Bertolini, didn't you?

1113
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:27,498
Did a few jobs for my dad back in the day,
before you got "born again."

1114
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:30,922
I used to hang with a lot of losers.

1115
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:36,545
Is this how you thought you'd die, Sal?
Dressed like an idiot?

1116
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:40,098
Who are you supposed to be?

1117
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:42,016
I'm The Motherfucker!

1118
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:45,512
And I'm here to end Kick-Ass.
Not just kill him.

1119
01:02:45,637 --> 01:02:49,187
I am gonna shit on
everything that he loves.

1120
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:52,145
Let's trash this place, guys.

1121
01:02:59,651 --> 01:03:01,369
"Miranda Swedlow"?

1122
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:05,995
Who's that, Sal?
She one of the whores on your team?

1123
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:23,638
Night Bitch all
snuggled up to Kick-Ass.

1124
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:26,186
Looks like our boy's got a new hot pocket.

1125
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,144
Want me to kill his dog?

1126
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:33,352
The dog? Jesus Christ,
I'm not that evil.

1127
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:37,188
Cut the old man's head off.

1128
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:39,487
You guys hungry?
I'm starving. Come on.

1129
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:41,694
Pizza, can we get pizza?

1130
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:42,777
We're getting pizza.

1131
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:45,660
Don't worry, I kill you first.

1132
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:51,036
Justice For...

1133
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:52,662
...ever.

1134
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:55,750
<i>A Brooklyn resident
was found decapitated last night.</i>

1135
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,834
<i>According to Twitter, a man claiming to be</i>

1136
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,885
<i>the world's first supervillain...</i>

1137
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:02,760
I told you, no TV.
You're grounded, remember?

1138
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,508
Marcus, I know I made you a promise,

1139
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:06,976
but I can't keep being someone I'm not.

1140
01:04:07,052 --> 01:04:08,895
When I see evil, I have to stop it.

1141
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:12,232
Mindy, what you did to
those girls at school was unacceptable.

1142
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:14,317
- You could have really hurt them.
- You're right, I could have,

1143
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:16,277
but instead I sent them home
with tummy-aches.

1144
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:17,946
Boo-fucking-hoo.

1145
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:21,150
I don't get it. This obsession
that you have with revenge is not healthy.

1146
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:23,117
If you don't let me
and the police do our jobs,

1147
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:25,036
there is gonna be nothing
that I can do for you.

1148
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:26,613
You're never gonna have a normal life

1149
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,164
and you'll probably
end up like your father.

1150
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:29,957
Marcus, they cut a guy's head off.

1151
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:31,956
Who else is going to stop them?

1152
01:04:32,077 --> 01:04:34,125
Kick-Ass? You?

1153
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:37,336
You go to your room and do your homework.

1154
01:04:46,925 --> 01:04:48,097
Now!

1155
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:55,688
Hey, guys, we're signing
a sympathy card for the Colonel's sister.

1156
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:59,689
You wanna go 5 bucks each
so we can send flowers from the team?

1157
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:03,408
Did you guys see
The Motherfucker's Twitter page?

1158
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:05,619
Who is this guy?
And what's his problem with us?

1159
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:08,363
I don't know, but he has
got some elephant-sized balls.

1160
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:11,082
He's been bragging on the web about
what they did to the Colonel.

1161
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:12,576
Can that be traced?

1162
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:15,412
I tried.
His IP address is masked.

1163
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:18,211
All right, here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna organize a fight.

1164
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:20,550
There are a lot of guys online
who said they're in if we need them.

1165
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:22,719
Are you kidding me?
This isn't <i>West Side Story.</i>

1166
01:05:22,794 --> 01:05:24,671
We didn't join up to be in a gang.

1167
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,131
We did this so we could help people.

1168
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:28,350
Shannon's right.
We need to leave this to the cops.

1169
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:29,968
We better start walking in pairs.

1170
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:33,976
Motherfucker's tweeted that the Colonel
was just the beginning.

1171
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:35,978
Anybody seen Night Bitch?

1172
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:49,036
Are you sure she's on that team?

1173
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:53,288
Stupid gash posted on her
superhero page that she's dating Kick-Ass.

1174
01:05:53,408 --> 01:05:55,456
So, yeah, I'm damn sure.

1175
01:05:59,414 --> 01:06:00,757
Hello, Night Bitch!

1176
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:02,084
Hey.

1177
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:06,004
Oh, she wants to take the party upstairs.

1178
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:08,257
We're gonna have a party.

1179
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,224
She closed the door.

1180
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:17,603
Don't worry, darling,
I'm not gonna kill you.

1181
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:20,318
I want you to give a message
to your boyfriend.

1182
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:23,772
Come on, wriggly.

1183
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:25,069
Let go!

1184
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:27,943
You're done banging superheroes, baby.

1185
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:30,695
It's time to see what evil dick feels like.

1186
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:39,708
Shit.

1187
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:41,668
What's wrong?

1188
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:45,927
What are you doing?

1189
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,130
Come on!

1190
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:54,435
God, okay, I'm just...
I'm not in the mood.

1191
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:56,680
I guess evil dick feels limp.

1192
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,766
Hurt her. Bad!

1193
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:03,353
Cops are coming.

1194
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:06,906
Leave it to Mother Russia.
She makes 10 times what we do.

1195
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:10,744
Fifty thousand a week.
Plus expenses.

1196
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:13,617
Hey, watch out!

1197
01:07:22,622 --> 01:07:23,965
Wow!

1198
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:36,636
Reverse it! Reverse it!

1199
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:46,905
Don't move! Freeze!

1200
01:07:53,111 --> 01:07:55,330
Fifty thousand.
She's worth it.

1201
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:05,916
Whoa, whoa!
Why are they backing up?

1202
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:07,842
Why is there a lawnmower on the trunk?

1203
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:12,760
Wow!

1204
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:21,397
We need back-up,
eight men down.

1205
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,267
I think you mean 10.

1206
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:37,831
Let's bounce! Put the word out
I'm building an evil army.

1207
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:40,203
All psychopaths
and ex-cons welcome.

1208
01:08:40,325 --> 01:08:43,545
I don't think you're gonna have a problem
when people hear about this.

1209
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:50,172
They just disappeared?

1210
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:51,965
All they have to do is
take off their masks,

1211
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:54,468
no one's gonna recognize them once
they're back in their street clothes.

1212
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:56,424
Your attention, please!

1213
01:08:56,549 --> 01:09:00,895
Feds traced the IP addresses
for all those other costumed freaks.

1214
01:09:01,012 --> 01:09:02,480
We got every law enforcement agency

1215
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:04,774
in the state working to hit them at once!

1216
01:09:04,891 --> 01:09:06,643
Why is Kick-Ass
on this list?

1217
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:07,773
His crew does community service.

1218
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:11,023
I don't give a shit.
Anyone wearing a mask is getting detained.

1219
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:13,528
We're putting an end to this tonight!

1220
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:17,571
<i>A lot of people said the cops were
too heavy-handed that night.</i>

1221
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:20,452
<i>But you gotta put it into context.</i>

1222
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:24,331
<i>The police didn't mind
our real life superhero stuff</i>

1223
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:25,832
<i>as long as we were picking up litter</i>

1224
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:27,630
<i>or helping old ladies cross the street.</i>

1225
01:09:29,374 --> 01:09:31,877
<i>But suddenly it was serious.</i>

1226
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:36,264
<i>Suddenly we represented
everything that was wrong with society.</i>

1227
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:38,095
Freeze!

1228
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:42,138
<i>Dad had warned me that
the real world had real consequences.</i>

1229
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:45,895
<i>As they pulled up, he must
have been feeling pretty damn vindicated.</i>

1230
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:51,154
Oh, shit, Dave.
What have you done?

1231
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:56,735
Police, open up.

1232
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:02,532
Hey.

1233
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:03,616
Hi.

1234
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:06,787
Uh, uh, it's me, Kick-Ass.

1235
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:10,961
Wow.

1236
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:13,877
You're actually pretty cute
under that mask.

1237
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:18,306
I'm so sorry about what happened.

1238
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:19,883
Don't be.

1239
01:10:20,842 --> 01:10:22,640
It's my own fault.

1240
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:25,430
We're gonna find these assholes
and make this right.

1241
01:10:25,513 --> 01:10:27,231
What's the point?

1242
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:31,060
I mean, we're really superheroes

1243
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:32,817
about as much as we're really dating.

1244
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:36,028
We don't even know each other's names.

1245
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:39,736
I think it's time to get back
to the real world.

1246
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:43,619
I thought we were trying
to make it a better place.

1247
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,993
Then why is it worse?

1248
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:50,872
<i>Maybe Night Bitch was right,</i>

1249
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:53,332
<i>which means Dad was, too.</i>

1250
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:57,337
<i>I mean, things had gotten out of hand.</i>

1251
01:10:57,837 --> 01:11:00,215
<i>Maybe it was time
for me to stop crashing at Marty's</i>

1252
01:11:00,298 --> 01:11:02,175
<i>and start apologizing.</i>

1253
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:13,068
Dad?

1254
01:11:13,728 --> 01:11:15,526
Whoa, whoa.
That's my dad.

1255
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:17,156
- Your dad's Kick-Ass?
- What?

1256
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:18,858
Yeah, he just gave himself up.

1257
01:11:20,568 --> 01:11:23,367
You don't understand.
He's doing this to protect me.

1258
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:24,740
Dad!

1259
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:26,703
Dad!

1260
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:45,434
- <i>Mindy?</i>
- Dave?

1261
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:47,098
I need your help.
My dad's been arrested.

1262
01:11:47,178 --> 01:11:49,306
They think he's Kick-Ass.
Can you talk to Marcus?

1263
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:51,231
- I'm grounded.
<i>- So?</i>

1264
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:53,192
So that means I can't get involved.

1265
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:54,894
- Look. Wait a second.
- <i>I wish I could help.</i>

1266
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:57,314
Mindy!
Are you on the phone?

1267
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:58,522
Look, I gotta go, okay?

1268
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:00,282
<i>I'm sorry, Dave.</i>

1269
01:12:00,358 --> 01:12:01,484
Mindy, wait, wait.

1270
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,798
<i>Hey, what the hell were you thinking?</i>

1271
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:17,838
Yeah, I could ask you the same thing.

1272
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:19,965
I can't believe you lied to them.

1273
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:21,671
I wasn't gonna do nothing
while you went to jail.

1274
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:25,008
I chose this.
You should let me deal with the consequences.

1275
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:26,559
I thought you wanted me to grow up.

1276
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:29,854
Yeah? When you get a kid of
your own one day, you'll understand.

1277
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:30,930
I'm gonna tell them the truth.

1278
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,107
No. Hey...
It'll just make things worse.

1279
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:35,189
Look, I spoke to my attorney.

1280
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:37,111
He said they gotta let me out by tomorrow.

1281
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:39,648
No actual crime was committed.

1282
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:44,778
There are people out there
who wanna kill Kick-Ass.

1283
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:48,122
Well, the cops are out
there looking for them,

1284
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:52,043
so the safest place for
Kick-Ass is right here, locked away.

1285
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:54,503
I don't know how you got
into all this shit, but

1286
01:12:54,579 --> 01:12:58,800
you gotta promise me you will never
dress up in that outfit again.

1287
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,797
Do you hear me?

1288
01:13:08,259 --> 01:13:09,761
I promise.

1289
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:21,321
This evil lair owns!

1290
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,482
Do people still say that, "own"?

1291
01:13:23,608 --> 01:13:25,406
Yeah, of course.

1292
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:27,612
Your shark.
Something's wrong.

1293
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:29,239
Think you used the wrong kind of water.

1294
01:13:29,322 --> 01:13:30,494
What the hell, Eyal?

1295
01:13:30,615 --> 01:13:32,913
It's fine, Chris. They're supposed to
lie at the bottom of the tank.

1296
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:34,790
It's just their way of, how you say,

1297
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:36,086
settling into their environment.

1298
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:38,005
Don't screw me on this, okay?

1299
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,252
You said we'd be ready in two days,

1300
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:40,584
we don't even have a men's room yet.

1301
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:41,918
Don't worry.

1302
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:43,924
What's with the bags of shit?

1303
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:45,801
It's fertilizer for the bombs.

1304
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:49,267
You're not a supervillain if you don't
have a plan to destroy the city.

1305
01:13:49,342 --> 01:13:51,765
It will not work.
You need a chemical kind.

1306
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:55,189
Do I have to do everything myself?
Just fix it!

1307
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:59,194
You must relax.
Everything is going as planned.

1308
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:01,779
Mmm, no. No.
Except it's not, okay?

1309
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:04,865
That sad sack
is not Kick-Ass.

1310
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:07,364
I've seen Kick-Ass,
he's like my age.

1311
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,366
Guy's old enough to be his father.

1312
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:10,867
No shit, right.

1313
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,874
I'm sorry, who are you?

1314
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:17,162
I, uh, volunteered
for your evil army, like the others.

1315
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:20,711
Right. I appreciate that.
Thanks for joining the cause.

1316
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:24,343
This is the VIP area for the core group.

1317
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,134
I just thought it was funny you said that.

1318
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:28,715
Because he is
Kick-Ass' father.

1319
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:29,848
Who?

1320
01:14:29,924 --> 01:14:32,018
Mr. Lizewski.
He's Kick-Ass' dad.

1321
01:14:32,802 --> 01:14:35,055
Shut up!

1322
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,978
Yeah. You're not
gonna tell anyone, are you?

1323
01:14:38,057 --> 01:14:39,400
No.

1324
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:41,982
But you, my friend, have just earned

1325
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:44,610
life-time access
to my VIP area.

1326
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:46,566
Go take a little seat.

1327
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:47,866
Hey, get the kid a Frappuccino,

1328
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:50,578
then put his little punk ass back to work.

1329
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:57,375
Okay.

1330
01:14:58,244 --> 01:14:59,587
Come on.

1331
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,676
Can I help you?

1332
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:16,888
The Motherfucker wants us to
take a picture with you.

1333
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,728
It helps that my dad
is a really good lawyer.

1334
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:21,442
Because I don't think my beautiful ass

1335
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:23,603
would last too long in prison.

1336
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:27,699
Whoa, that's weird.
Chris D'Amico just texted me a picture.

1337
01:15:27,815 --> 01:15:30,864
Red Mist? Whatever
happened to that guy?

1338
01:15:37,575 --> 01:15:39,043
What is it?

1339
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:40,544
Dude, what's wrong?

1340
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:46,004
What is it?

1341
01:16:00,848 --> 01:16:03,601
<i>The next few days passed in a fog.</i>

1342
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:08,864
<i>It didn't matter that I told
the police about Chris,</i>

1343
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:11,192
<i>they couldn't find him.</i>

1344
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:14,825
<i>The cops did show up at Dad's funeral,</i>

1345
01:16:15,196 --> 01:16:16,413
<i>not out of respect,</i>

1346
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:19,709
<i>but because they were scared
something would happen.</i>

1347
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:22,537
<i>My dad was a decent man.</i>

1348
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:25,669
<i>All he ever did was try
and give me a good life,</i>

1349
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:28,963
<i>and I told him no one
would notice when he was gone.</i>

1350
01:16:30,044 --> 01:16:31,842
I love you, pal.

1351
01:16:32,505 --> 01:16:34,724
I love you, too, Dad.

1352
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:42,977
You guys came.

1353
01:16:43,057 --> 01:16:46,903
We'd love to help you track down this
Chris D'Amico d-bag, but

1354
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:49,317
we just got out on parole.

1355
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:50,818
No, that's fine.

1356
01:16:51,398 --> 01:16:53,400
I'm not looking for revenge.

1357
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:56,996
Last thing I promised my dad was that
I was gonna give this up.

1358
01:16:57,363 --> 01:16:59,582
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

1359
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:01,416
But you started this.

1360
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:03,831
Now I'm ending it.

1361
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:17,346
Dave, I'm so sorry.
Do you hate me for not helping?

1362
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:19,468
No, not even a little bit.

1363
01:17:19,844 --> 01:17:22,768
You were right.
You gave it up.

1364
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:27,686
If I had, too, my dad would still be alive.

1365
01:17:29,854 --> 01:17:32,573
The only person I blame is myself.

1366
01:17:46,287 --> 01:17:47,960
Let's do this!

1367
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:51,834
Get down!

1368
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:57,757
Mindy!

1369
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:01,059
Spread out!

1370
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:11,228
Keep your head down!

1371
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:23,032
Come on!

1372
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:27,369
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1373
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:30,248
Get him!

1374
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:32,925
Get that van over here!

1375
01:18:35,294 --> 01:18:36,796
Hurry up!

1376
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:40,432
Mindy?

1377
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:41,892
Mindy!

1378
01:18:50,851 --> 01:18:52,148
Mindy?

1379
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:00,328
You gotta put this on.

1380
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:06,743
I'm not gonna do it.

1381
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:11,418
There's nothing left you can do to hurt me.

1382
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:15,426
You wanna bet?

1383
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:19,509
Whoa! Whoa!

1384
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:23,133
Game on, cocksuckers!

1385
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:29,147
There's a girl on the roof!

1386
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:44,071
She's still up there!

1387
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:02,590
- I think I got her!
- Go check!

1388
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:13,892
Get out there!

1389
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:31,627
Come on!
Move your head.

1390
01:21:00,314 --> 01:21:01,816
Pull over, pube-face.

1391
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:08,789
We know Chris D'Amico is The Motherfucker.
Where is he hiding?

1392
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,865
Eat a dick.

1393
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:11,165
You're gonna eat yours
if you don't start talking.

1394
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:13,460
Go ahead and shoot me, you little bitch.

1395
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:16,129
There's nothing you can do that
would make me talk.

1396
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:20,794
Look, hold on. I can't do this right now.
It's my dad's funeral.

1397
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:23,880
Dave, your father loved you.

1398
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:30,432
Just like my daddy loved me.
And I know it hurts, but maybe,

1399
01:21:31,095 --> 01:21:34,474
maybe that's the real meaning
of being a superhero.

1400
01:21:34,765 --> 01:21:38,360
Is taking that pain
and turning it into something good.

1401
01:21:39,436 --> 01:21:40,688
Something right.

1402
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:43,903
Remember what you told me?

1403
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:47,615
This is your life.
You've gotta live it.

1404
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:53,080
Now help me find some pliers.
I'm gonna make this guy eat his own dick.

1405
01:21:53,992 --> 01:21:55,209
Seriously?

1406
01:21:58,163 --> 01:21:59,710
- Hello?
<i>- Marcus?</i>

1407
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:01,834
Mindy. What's going on?
Are you okay?

1408
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:02,918
<i>I'm fine.</i>

1409
01:22:03,043 --> 01:22:05,171
We know where The Motherfucker's hiding.

1410
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:07,844
He's recruiting an army of supervillains
and making homemade bombs.

1411
01:22:07,965 --> 01:22:09,888
<i>Marcus, he wants to burn the city down.</i>

1412
01:22:09,967 --> 01:22:11,059
You promised me.

1413
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:16,478
I know you see me as this little girl,
but I'm not and I never was.

1414
01:22:17,099 --> 01:22:18,271
<i>You're right.</i>

1415
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:20,569
<i>Daddy did take my childhood away,</i>

1416
01:22:20,644 --> 01:22:22,396
<i>but I'm not so sure that was a bad thing.</i>

1417
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:24,402
Marcus, he gave me a gift,

1418
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:26,904
a gift that I can't escape
no matter how hard I try.

1419
01:22:27,484 --> 01:22:29,737
<i>And I don't need to spend
the next four years of my life</i>

1420
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:31,197
<i>trying to figure out who I am</i>

1421
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:34,283
because I already know.

1422
01:22:37,077 --> 01:22:38,750
I'm Hit Girl.

1423
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:46,003
I posted the address.
Do you think they'll show?

1424
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:48,304
Chris has an army.

1425
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:49,973
These real life super dweebs

1426
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:52,392
have been waiting
their whole lives for a call like this.

1427
01:23:02,853 --> 01:23:04,150
Are you okay?

1428
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:06,277
What? Yeah, no...
I'm fine.

1429
01:23:06,773 --> 01:23:07,865
Here.

1430
01:23:08,275 --> 01:23:09,868
Take this.

1431
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:12,697
"Last resort" really isn't my style.

1432
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:17,494
Dave, this isn't a comic book.
Real people are going to die tonight.

1433
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:20,129
My daddy was prepared for anything.

1434
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:22,089
Are you?

1435
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:28,803
Yeah.

1436
01:23:30,631 --> 01:23:31,974
I am.

1437
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:42,772
They should be back by now!

1438
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:43,852
It's definitely dead.

1439
01:23:43,936 --> 01:23:47,190
Says on the Internet
you're supposed to keep them in fresh water.

1440
01:23:47,272 --> 01:23:50,993
It is just hungry.
We must feed it.

1441
01:23:51,985 --> 01:23:53,953
Why are you looking at me?

1442
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:55,781
We gotta get this shit started.

1443
01:23:56,281 --> 01:24:00,377
<i>Oh, yeah. Have I got
a show for you bitches!</i>

1444
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:09,045
Motherfucker, Motherfucker...

1445
01:24:09,503 --> 01:24:11,801
<i>All right, party people!</i>

1446
01:24:12,214 --> 01:24:14,808
<i>We are gonna
kill Kick-Ass,</i>

1447
01:24:14,925 --> 01:24:18,646
<i>the very first superhero, together.</i>

1448
01:24:18,762 --> 01:24:23,768
<i>We are gonna cut him up into little pieces,
feed that shit to MC Shark</i>

1449
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:27,104
<i>and post it all over YouTube.
For real!</i>

1450
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:30,114
He's kidding, right?

1451
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:31,442
Motherfucker don't kid.

1452
01:24:31,525 --> 01:24:35,155
<i>That's not it.
I'm gonna give each and every one of you</i>

1453
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:37,828
<i>party favor fertilizer bombs!</i>

1454
01:24:37,948 --> 01:24:39,495
<i>And we are gonna get our riot on!</i>

1455
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:41,498
<i>That's what it means to be evil.</i>

1456
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:44,834
<i>We, my friends, are the real 1%,</i>

1457
01:24:44,997 --> 01:24:48,843
<i>and tonight we are gonna fuck this city up
or my name is not...</i>

1458
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:50,965
Chris D'Amico!

1459
01:24:52,254 --> 01:24:54,348
<i>That is not my name!</i>

1460
01:24:56,717 --> 01:25:00,438
No, you're right.
Your new name's Little Bitch.

1461
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:06,268
<i>Oh, this is perfect.</i>

1462
01:25:07,227 --> 01:25:09,855
<i>Are you really that stupid?</i>

1463
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:15,244
<i>There's two of you and a whole army of us.</i>

1464
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,994
<i>Do you really have
such a hard-on to die?</i>

1465
01:25:20,407 --> 01:25:21,704
No.

1466
01:25:21,825 --> 01:25:24,294
That's why we brought our friends.

1467
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:58,244
What's the matter, Chris?
Shit hit your shorts?

1468
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:02,871
Yeah, and I'm gonna
wipe my ass with your face.

1469
01:26:04,451 --> 01:26:07,751
You're gonna pay for
what you did to my dad.

1470
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:12,085
Your dad?
You blew up my dad with a bazooka.

1471
01:26:18,632 --> 01:26:19,929
Oh!

1472
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:48,041
Are you ready to die, little girl?

1473
01:26:48,245 --> 01:26:52,341
I might be if I have to keep looking
at that shit-stain you call a face.

1474
01:27:02,134 --> 01:27:03,135
Chris!

1475
01:27:59,316 --> 01:28:03,037
Hold him down.
I wanna see what his guts look like.

1476
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:08,867
That's enough from you boys!

1477
01:28:12,871 --> 01:28:14,873
Nicely done, sweetheart.

1478
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:24,640
That all you got?

1479
01:28:24,716 --> 01:28:27,515
No, I got my lethal zero G device.

1480
01:28:27,594 --> 01:28:28,641
Bullshit.

1481
01:28:30,263 --> 01:28:31,515
No shit.

1482
01:28:47,697 --> 01:28:48,664
Are you okay?

1483
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:53,583
Yeah. Thanks.
Ass Kicker.

1484
01:28:56,248 --> 01:28:57,374
Nice.

1485
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:06,822
Jesus, you are such a pussy.

1486
01:30:06,985 --> 01:30:09,659
What is the point of wearing a mask
if you can't do what you want?

1487
01:30:16,494 --> 01:30:18,246
We want to do good.

1488
01:30:18,371 --> 01:30:20,294
No, people want to win the lottery.

1489
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:24,590
People want to fuck Scarlett Johansson.

1490
01:30:35,055 --> 01:30:38,776
You think you can kill me
with little needle?

1491
01:30:57,452 --> 01:30:59,454
That's not what it's for.

1492
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:05,051
It's called adrenaline, bitch.

1493
01:31:07,045 --> 01:31:08,672
What was that, some cheap shot?

1494
01:31:08,755 --> 01:31:10,382
That was for the Colonel.

1495
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:14,761
Ahh!

1496
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:18,306
That's for Night Bitch.

1497
01:31:26,064 --> 01:31:27,566
And that's for my dad.

1498
01:32:03,935 --> 01:32:05,858
What the hell are you doing?

1499
01:32:06,271 --> 01:32:07,773
Saving your whiny ass!

1500
01:32:07,856 --> 01:32:08,857
No!

1501
01:32:08,982 --> 01:32:12,452
I won't let you have this.
I'd rather die!

1502
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:16,623
What is wrong with you, dude?
This is not a comic book, it's real life!

1503
01:32:16,948 --> 01:32:20,293
When you're dead, it's done.
There's no sequel.

1504
01:32:20,452 --> 01:32:25,174
You made this real.
You started it! And I'm gonna finish it.

1505
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:28,885
I'll be immortal, like an evil Jesus.

1506
01:32:39,345 --> 01:32:40,346
Wait!

1507
01:32:52,942 --> 01:32:55,240
I'm alive.

1508
01:32:55,361 --> 01:32:56,658
Dave, I'm so sorry.

1509
01:33:05,955 --> 01:33:08,208
<i>The feeling was indescribable.</i>

1510
01:33:08,666 --> 01:33:10,885
<i>Chris D'Amico, dead.</i>

1511
01:33:12,045 --> 01:33:15,345
<i>His wannabe supervillains, defeated.</i>

1512
01:33:16,883 --> 01:33:19,727
<i>But did we make the world a better place?</i>

1513
01:33:20,678 --> 01:33:25,354
Or did we just finish something
that began when I first put on this mask?

1514
01:33:28,186 --> 01:33:30,188
The cops are coming.

1515
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:32,357
They'll take care of the bad guys.

1516
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:35,364
We better skedaddle before they get here.

1517
01:33:35,985 --> 01:33:36,986
We did it.

1518
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:38,071
Fuck, yeah.

1519
01:33:38,154 --> 01:33:39,872
Hey, language.

1520
01:33:40,365 --> 01:33:44,871
You're right, if we're gonna
dress like heroes, we should act like heroes.

1521
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:48,043
He'd be proud of you, Dave.

1522
01:33:48,706 --> 01:33:50,925
He'd be proud of all of us.

1523
01:33:52,836 --> 01:33:55,259
You know we can never do this again, right?

1524
01:33:57,298 --> 01:33:58,641
It's over.

1525
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:04,389
One last time.
Come on.

1526
01:34:08,309 --> 01:34:11,654
What do you say,
Hit Girl? Are you in?

1527
01:34:13,398 --> 01:34:15,241
Why the hell not?

1528
01:34:17,068 --> 01:34:19,070
Justice Forever!

1529
01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:33,589
Thanks for the ride.

1530
01:34:34,085 --> 01:34:36,133
I'll see you at school.

1531
01:34:37,922 --> 01:34:40,095
I'm leaving New York, Dave.

1532
01:34:40,717 --> 01:34:44,221
I can't go home.
I can't put Marcus in that position.

1533
01:34:44,429 --> 01:34:47,433
Why? He won't arrest you.
You just saved the city.

1534
01:34:47,599 --> 01:34:50,603
Yeah, well,
I also killed six guys with a cop's gun.

1535
01:34:50,727 --> 01:34:53,105
Vigilantes don't get a free pass.

1536
01:34:53,771 --> 01:34:57,401
You can't go.
People need you.

1537
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:00,362
- They've got you now.
- Mindy...

1538
01:35:02,989 --> 01:35:04,536
I'm not like you.

1539
01:35:04,657 --> 01:35:08,127
You don't have to be a bad-ass
to be a superhero, Dave.

1540
01:35:10,163 --> 01:35:12,291
You just have to be brave.

1541
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:25,352
What was that?

1542
01:35:28,556 --> 01:35:30,479
That was my first kiss.

1543
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:35,822
Be nice or I'll rip your ass
out through your mouth.

1544
01:35:42,779 --> 01:35:44,076
<i>When Mindy left,</i>

1545
01:35:44,781 --> 01:35:48,126
<i>that's when I finally understood
where my life was going.</i>

1546
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:51,754
<i>Just like it had to eventually happen,</i>

1547
01:35:51,829 --> 01:35:54,924
<i>that real people would
try to be superheroes.</i>

1548
01:35:55,541 --> 01:35:58,260
<i>Eventually it had to end, too.</i>

1549
01:36:14,811 --> 01:36:18,611
<i>Superheroes can't exist
in the real world for a reason.</i>

1550
01:36:18,731 --> 01:36:22,736
<i>It's because the real world
needs real heroes.</i>

1551
01:36:23,486 --> 01:36:26,740
<i>And not some punk
in a wet-suit playing dress-up,</i>

1552
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:31,749
<i>but a genuine bad-ass
who can really kick ass.</i>

1553
01:42:18,341 --> 01:42:19,684
<i>Hello?</i>

1554
01:42:20,468 --> 01:42:22,971
<i>Please. Don't go.</i>

1555
01:42:23,804 --> 01:42:25,351
<i>Don't go.</i>

1556
01:42:26,724 --> 01:42:28,476
Is anybody there?

1557
01:42:31,646 --> 01:42:32,989
Hello?

1558
01:42:37,151 --> 01:42:39,574
Some help, please?

1559
01:42:39,737 --> 01:42:43,367
A shark bit my fucking dick off
and I can't get some water?
