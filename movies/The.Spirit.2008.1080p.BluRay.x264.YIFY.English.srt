1
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,564
<i>I am Death, Denny Colt.</i>

2
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:26,704
<i>You are the only man who has
ever escaped my cold embrace.</i>

3
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,067
<i>But I am never far away.</i>

4
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,661
<i>Yes.</i>

5
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:37,494
<i>I'm always with you.</i>

6
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:18,364
- Yeah.
- Something big is breaking down...

7
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:19,932
...by the mudflats, Spirit.

8
00:02:20,133 --> 00:02:21,760
<i>By the wreck of an old cargo ship.</i>

9
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,466
Word on the street
is The Octopus might be in on it.

10
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:25,656
<i>I'd call it in...</i>

11
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:29,467
...but who knows
how far his tentacles spread?

12
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,100
<i>Who we can trust?</i>

13
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,562
I'm on my way.

14
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:49,698
<i>My city. She's always there for me.</i>

15
00:03:51,734 --> 00:03:55,602
<i>Every lonely night, she's there for me.</i>

16
00:03:55,933 --> 00:04:00,370
<i>She's not some tarted-up fraud
all dressed up like a piece of jailbait.</i>

17
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:02,593
<i>No. She's an old city...</i>

18
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,530
<i>... old and proud of her every pock
and crack and wrinkle.</i>

19
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:10,661
<i>She's my sweetheart, my plaything.</i>

20
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:14,901
<i>She doesn't hide what she is,
what she's made of:</i>

21
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,831
<i>Sweat, muscle
and blood of generations.</i>

22
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,258
<i>She sleeps.</i>

23
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:31,925
<i>After midnight and until dawn,
only shadows move in the silence.</i>

24
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:33,930
There she is!

25
00:04:34,266 --> 00:04:36,200
<i>- Get her.
- Damn, I've got no time for this.</i>

26
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,964
<i>My city screams. She needs me.</i>

27
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:46,632
<i>She is my love. She is my life.</i>

28
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,733
<i>And I am her Spirit.</i>

29
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:17,757
Don't worry, you're safe now.
Try to catch your breath.

30
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:20,434
- Here, let's get you to your feet.
- Police!

31
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:21,930
Over here, MacReady.

32
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:24,795
This is a good man, you can trust him.
Tell him everything.

33
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:27,433
- I will.
- Call your shrink if you got one.

34
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,698
What are you?

35
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,300
That's The Spirit.

36
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,161
God bless him.

37
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,791
<i>She provides for me, my city does.</i>

38
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:14,801
<i>She gives me everything I need.</i>

39
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,225
Move it over, Liebowitz. I'm driving.

40
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,494
Sussman called.

41
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:18,724
Something's going down here.
Could be big.

42
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:20,901
- How big?
- Octopus big.

43
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,398
- Jesus! We better call for backup.
- Not just yet.

44
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,330
Sussman wants this one
kept under the radar for now.

45
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:29,434
<i>Yes. Come closer. Come home to me.</i>

46
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:31,532
You hear that, boss?

47
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,300
Every goddamn night.

48
00:07:33,866 --> 00:07:38,735
Lorelei. The angel of death.
She's never far away. Not from me.

49
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:41,834
They say only sailors and cops
can hear her.

50
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:44,792
Well, I'm not a sailor.

51
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,263
And I'm not a cop.

52
00:07:57,033 --> 00:07:58,660
- Officer down.
<i>- Roger that, I copy.</i>

53
00:07:58,866 --> 00:08:00,299
Get an ambulance. Call Dolan.

54
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,400
<i>- Commissioner...
- Not Commissioner Dolan.</i>

55
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:04,032
<i>- Dr. Dolan.</i>
- Still breathing.

56
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,066
- Spirit says he's still breathing.
<i>- Keep me advised.</i>

57
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:08,699
Hurts like a son of a bitch.

58
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:10,523
Take it easy. We'll get you home.

59
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:13,760
That broad.

60
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:16,662
- You should have seen her.
- Broad?

61
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:18,697
A beautiful broad.

62
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,161
She was beautiful.

63
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,665
Keep him talking. Keep him awake.

64
00:08:22,866 --> 00:08:25,130
You look for more footprints,
Liebowitz.

65
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,359
Yeah. She was beautiful.

66
00:10:12,632 --> 00:10:14,827
If this is the wrong box,
I'll kill you myself.

67
00:10:15,033 --> 00:10:17,331
Just get us out of here.
It's The Octopus.

68
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:19,227
You know what he can do.

69
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:21,833
Shut up and bleed.

70
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,824
You look for more footprints,
Liebowitz.

71
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:36,126
She was beautiful.

72
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:39,097
And she wasn't looking
for a fight, either.

73
00:10:40,632 --> 00:10:41,621
Easy, now.

74
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,801
Just breathe through your nose
if you can.

75
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,560
Getting dizzy.

76
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:50,462
Steady. Steady.

77
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:55,891
Heads up!

78
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,992
Take it home, boys.

79
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,603
When me and The Spirit get together,
we like to party all night.

80
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:29,499
There is nothing I like better
than kicking your ass all night long.

81
00:11:31,433 --> 00:11:33,025
Except maybe eggs.

82
00:11:36,866 --> 00:11:37,855
Where's the truck?

83
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:39,727
Silken Floss is the most
beautiful woman.

84
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,730
How do we find our way home
without her?

85
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:43,992
Silken Floss is the most beautiful
woman ever.

86
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,462
She was supposed to be here.

87
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,463
How do we find our way home
without her?

88
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,293
Where's the truck?

89
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:50,932
I found the truck!

90
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:54,762
Silken Floss
is the most beautiful woman ever.

91
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,530
Load up the box and pile in,
specimens.

92
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:04,327
You've done your
petri dishes proud.

93
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:10,026
No need to wait for the boss
if that's The Spirit back there.

94
00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:14,366
The Octopus always finds his nemesis
so distracting.

95
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:17,399
It is The Spirit. He had his hat on.
We was watching.

96
00:12:17,866 --> 00:12:19,800
Well, then, they'll be at it all night.

97
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:23,059
- Yeah, boss said so.
- Boss said so. We was watching.

98
00:12:23,266 --> 00:12:26,702
Oh, God. Yeah. I heard.

99
00:12:28,866 --> 00:12:32,393
Silken Floss is the most beautiful...

100
00:12:55,466 --> 00:12:57,297
You're giving me a headache,
Octopus.

101
00:12:59,566 --> 00:13:02,057
It's gonna get worse
before it gets better, pretty boy.

102
00:13:02,266 --> 00:13:03,733
You're right about that.

103
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:26,864
Come on!

104
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,168
Toilets are always funny.

105
00:14:50,266 --> 00:14:51,460
I was watching.

106
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:05,568
That's enough.
Let's get out of here.

107
00:15:06,966 --> 00:15:08,900
Pretty boy.

108
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:12,060
Tough boy.

109
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:15,595
I'll be seeing you again...

110
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:16,823
...real soon.

111
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:19,393
I'm gonna be the death of you,
Octopus.

112
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:21,891
Death?

113
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,625
Not for me, brother. Death, he says.

114
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,994
I'm gonna kill you all kinds of dead.

115
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,033
I had you beat like eggs.

116
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:32,030
Heck you did.

117
00:15:32,233 --> 00:15:35,327
Anybody watching could've seen
I had you right where I wanted you.

118
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:37,466
In your dreams.

119
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:39,624
You're an accident.

120
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,494
You never should've happened.

121
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:44,224
Your mind ain't right, Octopus.

122
00:15:44,432 --> 00:15:48,459
You're talking crazy.
You're talking crazy talk.

123
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,464
We're the only two like us, pretty boy.

124
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,861
- I'm nothing like you.
- Nothing like me?

125
00:15:55,866 --> 00:15:59,734
Well, you sure can take
a lot of punishment, sweetheart.

126
00:15:59,933 --> 00:16:01,195
Just like me.

127
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:04,023
You ever wonder why?

128
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,627
Never even crossed my mind.

129
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,994
Well, I'll be learning you!

130
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,068
I'll be learning you real soon.

131
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,029
I'll be learning you.

132
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:26,066
Oh, well, look who's here.

133
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:28,734
Boss, we better get out of here.

134
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:45,160
<i>Such pain.</i>

135
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:47,829
<i>Such suffering.</i>

136
00:16:49,265 --> 00:16:50,960
<i>Sleep.</i>

137
00:16:54,432 --> 00:16:56,764
<i>Come on, come on, come on.</i>

138
00:16:56,966 --> 00:16:58,524
<i>Wake up.</i>

139
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:01,326
Wake up.

140
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:04,893
Wake up.

141
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,465
Hey, baby.

142
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,497
- Ellen.
- You're a mess.

143
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:10,694
Three bullets across the deltoid.

144
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:13,265
They went straight through me.
Hardly took any meat.

145
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,559
Major contusions on any visible skin.

146
00:17:15,766 --> 00:17:17,597
Oh, come on, Ellen.
They never last long.

147
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:20,791
Evidence of a profusely bleeding
cranial wound.

148
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,092
No, that's nothing. That's just a bump.

149
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:25,130
Yeah, you're a mess, all right.

150
00:17:25,332 --> 00:17:27,698
- Really, I'm okay.
- No, this is serious.

151
00:17:27,899 --> 00:17:30,299
For God's sake,
you can't keep taking these chances.

152
00:17:30,499 --> 00:17:33,491
- I'll be fine.
- You're bleeding out of your head.

153
00:17:38,366 --> 00:17:41,426
- It's gone all sticky. It'll stop.
- You need to be admitted.

154
00:17:41,632 --> 00:17:44,726
No. You know how much I hate that.
It takes forever.

155
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:48,300
- Don't fight me this time.
- I'll be all right. It's just...

156
00:17:48,499 --> 00:17:51,195
I'm missing something.
It's really important.

157
00:17:52,699 --> 00:17:54,428
- Do you know where you are?
- Sure.

158
00:17:54,632 --> 00:17:57,192
- What city?
- Central City, U.S.A.

159
00:17:57,399 --> 00:17:58,764
What year is it?

160
00:17:58,966 --> 00:18:00,558
This year.

161
00:18:00,766 --> 00:18:02,825
- Do you know who you are?
- The Spirit.

162
00:18:03,033 --> 00:18:05,501
- I beat up bad guys.
- And sometimes they beat you up.

163
00:18:05,699 --> 00:18:08,668
And it really hurts when that happens,
but I always get better.

164
00:18:08,866 --> 00:18:12,199
I don't know why. You don't know why.
But The Octopus knows something.

165
00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:13,388
Why do you say that?

166
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:15,396
Because he told me
he knows something.

167
00:18:16,366 --> 00:18:18,664
- You're delirious. Come on.
- No.

168
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:21,530
Oh, golly, will you look at that.

169
00:18:22,332 --> 00:18:23,390
That was close, buddy.

170
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:25,897
I was looking all over for you.

171
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:29,860
There. That's better.

172
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:32,296
Yup. That's better.

173
00:18:33,366 --> 00:18:34,697
That tears it.

174
00:18:34,899 --> 00:18:36,025
You're delusional.

175
00:18:36,232 --> 00:18:37,699
- Tuska, over here!
- Ellen!

176
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:42,530
Dr. Ellen Dolan! Over here, right now!

177
00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:48,366
I can hear fluid in his chest.

178
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:50,227
It's faint, but I swear it's there.

179
00:18:56,766 --> 00:18:58,893
I got it. He's got blood
in both his lungs.

180
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,658
Stabilize him, get him on Pegasus.

181
00:19:00,866 --> 00:19:03,061
- Go back to the helicopter.
- I'll flip him over.

182
00:19:03,265 --> 00:19:05,961
No, leave him flat. Get me new gloves.
Gauze.

183
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:14,635
Hurry it up. If you can't move any faster,
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

184
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,233
- You find anything?
- No, sir.

185
00:19:17,432 --> 00:19:19,798
I'm just feeling dizzy
from all the action, I guess.

186
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:22,297
- Yeah, we're all damn impressed.
- Thanks.

187
00:19:22,499 --> 00:19:24,967
You're doing this town no good
with your hot-dogging.

188
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,326
- I don't follow you.
- We're flat on our asses...

189
00:19:27,532 --> 00:19:29,796
...happy to clean up
after your dog-and-pony show.

190
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:31,694
Not this again. You know the score.

191
00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:33,833
I thought I did.
Go ahead and enlighten me.

192
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:35,227
Bring me up to speed.

193
00:19:35,432 --> 00:19:37,957
Sussman wanted things kept quiet.
Leave it at that.

194
00:19:38,165 --> 00:19:39,757
He thinks I don't run a tight ship?

195
00:19:39,966 --> 00:19:43,367
Suspected a leak in your department.
Didn't want The Octopus getting away.

196
00:19:43,566 --> 00:19:46,626
So you're Internal Affairs now, huh?
I must have missed that memo.

197
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,393
Come on, it was a judgment call.
I gave it my best shot.

198
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:52,796
I got one officer an inch from dying,
another, his head yanked off...

199
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:55,467
...because you went off half-cocked
after The Octopus.

200
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:58,157
You're damn right
I'm going after The Octopus!

201
00:19:58,366 --> 00:20:00,630
And you're going through my men
like toilet paper.

202
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,425
You been to Dropsie Avenue and C?

203
00:20:02,632 --> 00:20:04,122
- Have you seen those girls?
- Yeah.

204
00:20:04,332 --> 00:20:07,961
Some just learning how to ride a bike,
there they are, selling their souls...

205
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,292
...slaves to The Octopus
and his poison.

206
00:20:10,499 --> 00:20:15,163
Maybe you and your force
could use a little obsession, Dolan.

207
00:20:15,366 --> 00:20:18,893
Maybe you and your force
could work a little harder.

208
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,627
Ellen's right. You're off your rocker,
talking about cops like that.

209
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,233
Maybe if you and your force
could find The Octopus...

210
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:28,196
...I wouldn't have to play it solo.
- Solo, huh?

211
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:29,423
Solo?

212
00:20:29,632 --> 00:20:31,532
That wasn't our deal, hotshot.

213
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:34,566
Well, then maybe we don't have a deal
anymore, commissioner.

214
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:36,388
<i>Why, you...</i>

215
00:20:43,332 --> 00:20:45,493
You're living at the edge of a cliff, son.

216
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:49,692
And all you got is a tired old man
trying to hold you back.

217
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,559
Look, we're both tired.

218
00:20:55,632 --> 00:20:57,099
Yeah.

219
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:00,466
- Yeah.
- Just give me 10 minutes.

220
00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:04,696
Hell, I don't know why I even bother
to try and talk to you anymore.

221
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:07,265
Just give me 10 minutes.

222
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,990
Just to clear my head.

223
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:11,394
Right. Sure.

224
00:21:12,699 --> 00:21:16,465
What's 10 minutes
in a man's life anyway?

225
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:18,123
Spirit?

226
00:21:18,332 --> 00:21:19,856
Sir.

227
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,802
That cliff I was talking about?

228
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,030
There's no bottom.

229
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:29,194
Don't jump.

230
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:38,564
<i>"What are you?"
That's what the woman asked me.</i>

231
00:21:38,766 --> 00:21:40,700
<i>It's a good question.</i>

232
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,333
<i>I wish I had an answer for her.</i>

233
00:21:43,532 --> 00:21:45,796
<i>Am I a crazy man?</i>

234
00:21:46,132 --> 00:21:48,623
<i>Or am I a man at all?</i>

235
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,460
<i>Some nights, like this one...</i>

236
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:54,863
<i>... when the wind bites deep,
bone deep...</i>

237
00:21:55,066 --> 00:21:59,230
<i>... and even my city
seems to leave me behind, I wonder:</i>

238
00:21:59,432 --> 00:22:01,263
<i>Am I some sort of ghost?</i>

239
00:22:01,466 --> 00:22:04,060
<i>Some sort of Flying Dutchman?</i>

240
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:06,733
<i>If the wind picked up
hard enough...</i>

241
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:09,126
<i>... would I just blow away?</i>

242
00:22:09,766 --> 00:22:11,290
<i>I'm not a cop.</i>

243
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:13,364
<i>Not anymore.</i>

244
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:16,232
<i>Not even a dead man.</i>

245
00:22:17,265 --> 00:22:19,529
<i>Not even a spirit.</i>

246
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,299
We made it, boss.
Just like you said we would.

247
00:22:28,866 --> 00:22:29,992
You still here?

248
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:34,592
Of course I'm still here. I'm your trigger.
I blowed holes right through The Spirit.

249
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,165
You're a trigger, Pathos.

250
00:22:37,366 --> 00:22:38,492
Just look at you.

251
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,500
Quick Draw McGraw himself.

252
00:22:41,699 --> 00:22:43,997
I'll be great.
I don't have any bones sticking out.

253
00:22:44,199 --> 00:22:46,360
A couple of splints, I'll be good to go.

254
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:50,229
Yeah, just hop right over to St. Alice's,
get fixed up all nice and new.

255
00:22:50,432 --> 00:22:53,196
I'll have to explain why
a criminal mastermind like myself...

256
00:22:53,399 --> 00:22:55,924
...doesn't provide his employees
with medical insurance.

257
00:22:56,132 --> 00:22:58,566
That'd be egg on my face, Pathos.

258
00:22:58,766 --> 00:23:03,226
You know I don't like
egg on my face.

259
00:23:03,432 --> 00:23:05,059
- Hadn't thought of that.
- No.

260
00:23:05,265 --> 00:23:08,564
Using your brain?
That, you weren't built for.

261
00:23:08,766 --> 00:23:10,631
Just tell me
where the emergency room is.

262
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:14,291
I'll tell them I'm one of the homelesses.
They don't make them pay.

263
00:23:14,499 --> 00:23:16,626
Homelesses always get hurt.
Because it's free.

264
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:18,528
- That'll work!
- So will this.

265
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:26,760
No egg on my face!

266
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,631
Not a glob!

267
00:23:32,065 --> 00:23:33,965
Not a glob.

268
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,634
Any other case, little buddy.

269
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,892
Any other job.

270
00:23:47,232 --> 00:23:49,792
If it were anyone but her.

271
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:54,560
Sand.

272
00:23:55,366 --> 00:23:58,199
Sand Saref.

273
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:08,527
Where's your bike?

274
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:11,031
You scrape your knee,
or are you scared for a race?

275
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:13,200
No, I got sick of that stupid bike.

276
00:24:13,399 --> 00:24:16,266
You got sick of losing races to me
is more like it.

277
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:17,822
Where'd you put it?

278
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,559
I pawned it over at Fellman's.

279
00:24:20,766 --> 00:24:23,599
- I got a few bucks for it.
- Pawned it?

280
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:28,890
Look there.

281
00:24:29,899 --> 00:24:31,332
I bet those are real diamonds.

282
00:24:32,899 --> 00:24:35,026
You see how they catch the light,
Denny?

283
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,226
Only real ones do that.

284
00:24:44,499 --> 00:24:46,364
What's with you?

285
00:24:47,332 --> 00:24:48,731
Nothing much.

286
00:24:48,933 --> 00:24:51,993
- He's not drinking again, is he?
- No, no, he's not drinking.

287
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,826
What's got you needing money, then?

288
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,701
Just something that I saw
over at the window at Kurtzman's.

289
00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:00,332
Is it a badge, like my dad's?

290
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:01,965
No, no. It wasn't a badge.

291
00:25:02,165 --> 00:25:03,962
Good, you ain't hardly
earned a badge.

292
00:25:04,165 --> 00:25:07,623
Well, it was something
that I thought that, you know...

293
00:25:09,032 --> 00:25:13,059
...you might like seeing
as how you like shiny things and all.

294
00:25:19,065 --> 00:25:23,525
It opens up too.
You can take it and look at the picture.

295
00:25:24,965 --> 00:25:28,264
If you don't like it, old man Kurtzman
said he'd take it back.

296
00:25:32,733 --> 00:25:34,325
Do you like it?

297
00:25:41,532 --> 00:25:43,523
So you want me to be your girl?

298
00:25:45,132 --> 00:25:48,124
Yeah, sure. I mean, if...

299
00:25:48,332 --> 00:25:50,061
You know, if it's all the same to you.

300
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:53,063
Well, I suppose I can wear it
now and then.

301
00:25:55,766 --> 00:25:59,429
- But that doesn't make me your girl.
- Yeah. Doesn't make...

302
00:26:12,532 --> 00:26:15,501
Yeah, we had us a time, all right.

303
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,326
The way only city kids could.

304
00:26:17,932 --> 00:26:19,024
I love it!

305
00:26:32,932 --> 00:26:35,696
It says here Heracles himself
fought with the Argonauts.

306
00:26:36,332 --> 00:26:39,233
Imagine Jason and Heracles
back-to-back.

307
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:42,458
- Yeah.
- Jason gleaming in his Golden Fleece.

308
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:44,861
Yeah. Yeah.

309
00:27:02,199 --> 00:27:05,657
Then everything went right
straight to hell.

310
00:27:06,866 --> 00:27:09,835
<i>My Uncle Pete was
a has-been fighter.</i>

311
00:27:10,032 --> 00:27:13,832
<i>Sand's dad, a beat cop who was
always looking out for dumb old Pete.</i>

312
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:17,524
Hey, Pete! What's all this?
What's all...?

313
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:30,864
<i>My Uncle Pete did the only thing
his punch-battered brain...</i>

314
00:27:31,065 --> 00:27:33,033
<i>... could tell him to do.</i>

315
00:27:37,332 --> 00:27:40,665
<i>Sand got there
a few minutes before me.</i>

316
00:27:43,532 --> 00:27:44,521
Come on.

317
00:27:44,733 --> 00:27:47,361
<i>I tried to be strong for both of us.</i>

318
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:49,532
Come on.

319
00:27:50,766 --> 00:27:54,668
<i>I said some stuff.
I can't remember what.</i>

320
00:27:55,865 --> 00:27:58,527
<i>And then that jerk reporter
latched onto us.</i>

321
00:27:58,733 --> 00:27:59,791
Sol, I can't miss this.

322
00:27:59,998 --> 00:28:02,091
So, kids, just how does this
make you feel?

323
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:03,391
Are you scared?

324
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,693
- We ain't talking, so leave us alone.
- You gotta give me something.

325
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:08,860
<i>I'll give you something.</i>

326
00:28:09,065 --> 00:28:11,033
<i>I'll give you three words.</i>

327
00:28:11,699 --> 00:28:13,394
<i>I hate cops.</i>

328
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:15,032
Just leave us alone, will you?

329
00:28:18,733 --> 00:28:21,361
I know you're heartbroke, Sand.

330
00:28:21,932 --> 00:28:23,866
So am I,
but you didn't mean what you said.

331
00:28:24,065 --> 00:28:25,464
Leave me alone, stay away.

332
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:27,395
- Give it a while.
- Give it a while?

333
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:30,659
- What? What, us?
- Well, yeah, that's what I mean.

334
00:28:30,865 --> 00:28:33,732
So, sure, we grow up
and we have kids in this sinkhole?

335
00:28:33,932 --> 00:28:35,559
You're just not talking straight.

336
00:28:35,766 --> 00:28:38,792
And you become a cop
just like you always wanted to.

337
00:28:39,632 --> 00:28:41,896
Yeah. Yeah, maybe I do.

338
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:45,967
Yeah, and then some punched-out
drunk of an old boxer shoots you dead?

339
00:28:46,165 --> 00:28:48,360
- Do you think I want that?
- It wasn't Pete!

340
00:28:48,566 --> 00:28:51,660
- It was that guido, and you know that.
- Who cares?

341
00:28:51,865 --> 00:28:54,026
You know what?
I don't want your world.

342
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:57,360
I want diamonds,
and I want sports cars...

343
00:28:57,566 --> 00:29:00,967
...and I want long dresses
and I want money. And I want lots of it.

344
00:29:01,165 --> 00:29:03,998
And where are you going to find
all that, Sand?

345
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:07,191
I'm not gonna find it here.
Not in this toilet of a town.

346
00:29:07,566 --> 00:29:10,967
So you're too good for me?
You're too good for all of us? Is that it?

347
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:16,535
I am too good for you,
and I am too good for this dump.

348
00:29:17,199 --> 00:29:19,565
- I'm going away, I'm going far away.
- All right.

349
00:29:19,766 --> 00:29:21,859
I'm gonna go
all over the world, become rich...

350
00:29:22,065 --> 00:29:25,091
...and no one is ever gonna know
that I came from this hole!

351
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:26,891
No one.
And I am never coming back.

352
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:28,766
Then do whatever you want, Sand!

353
00:29:30,232 --> 00:29:33,224
I don't care about you neither.
I never even wanna see you again!

354
00:29:33,432 --> 00:29:35,525
I hate you, Sand.

355
00:29:41,699 --> 00:29:43,826
<i>I never saw her again.</i>

356
00:29:44,965 --> 00:29:47,433
<i>Word is she took off for Europe.</i>

357
00:29:48,432 --> 00:29:51,367
I never knew if she was alive or dead.

358
00:29:53,265 --> 00:29:55,256
Until now.

359
00:29:57,466 --> 00:30:00,435
There's only one way this locket
ended up in poor Sussman's hand.

360
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,601
She was there. She was wearing it.
She is implicated.

361
00:30:03,798 --> 00:30:05,732
If she's doing business
with The Octopus...

362
00:30:05,932 --> 00:30:07,627
...then my feelings
don't mean a damn.

363
00:30:07,832 --> 00:30:10,266
I must find Sand Saref...

364
00:30:10,466 --> 00:30:12,366
...and bring her in.

365
00:30:21,366 --> 00:30:23,596
My beautiful Sand Saref.

366
00:30:23,798 --> 00:30:26,062
Are you missing something, my love?

367
00:30:27,032 --> 00:30:29,091
Nothing important.

368
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:34,330
Just something I lost a long time ago.

369
00:30:43,932 --> 00:30:46,332
Mark this moment, all of you.

370
00:30:46,532 --> 00:30:48,864
A new age begins.

371
00:30:49,065 --> 00:30:51,124
An age of great deeds.

372
00:30:51,332 --> 00:30:55,291
An age of great power.

373
00:30:55,499 --> 00:30:57,592
Yes.

374
00:30:57,932 --> 00:31:00,423
All mine.

375
00:31:00,932 --> 00:31:04,561
The blood of Heracles is mine.

376
00:31:30,332 --> 00:31:33,233
I am sorely disappointed.

377
00:31:35,199 --> 00:31:36,723
Which one of you brought me this?

378
00:31:36,932 --> 00:31:38,593
I guess that'd be me.

379
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:41,762
- On your knees, then.
- Sure thing.

380
00:31:43,265 --> 00:31:45,199
What happened?
What went wrong?

381
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:47,196
Nothing went wrong,
thanks for asking.

382
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:50,163
Where's my vase? I'm supposed
to have a vase full of blood.

383
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:53,563
- It's supposed to be in that box.
- Must've been in the other box.

384
00:31:53,765 --> 00:31:54,891
What other box?

385
00:31:55,099 --> 00:31:57,226
Must've been in the other box.

386
00:31:57,432 --> 00:31:59,297
What other box, you fart?

387
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:02,494
The one the pretty lady run off with.
We was watching.

388
00:32:02,698 --> 00:32:03,995
Sand Saref.

389
00:32:04,332 --> 00:32:07,665
I thought I scared her off
with time to spare.

390
00:32:08,232 --> 00:32:10,359
What's she doing in Central City,
anyway?

391
00:32:10,566 --> 00:32:16,027
It didn't occur to you doorstops to
mention that there was a second box?

392
00:32:16,232 --> 00:32:19,463
Nope, but it looked just like this one.
We was watching.

393
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:24,591
Seppuku across the stomach,
left to right.

394
00:32:27,165 --> 00:32:28,826
That tickles.

395
00:32:29,065 --> 00:32:31,863
With the sword, toe cheese.

396
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:38,466
So Sand Saref has the blood.

397
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:42,158
You know, you could've offed her
and brought back both boxes.

398
00:32:42,366 --> 00:32:44,561
That would've simplified things
considerably.

399
00:32:44,765 --> 00:32:47,029
Oh, I'm supposed
to do everything around here?

400
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:49,159
Now, that'll wake you up.

401
00:32:49,366 --> 00:32:51,357
You have to do something
about Sand Saref.

402
00:32:51,566 --> 00:32:53,966
Don't worry about Sand Saref.

403
00:32:54,165 --> 00:32:57,362
That lady's got a thing for the bling.

404
00:32:57,698 --> 00:33:01,395
She was after that other box
and whatever it is that's inside of it.

405
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:04,159
It's kind of creepy
the way it glows like that.

406
00:33:04,366 --> 00:33:07,358
So the situation's hardly a debacle.

407
00:33:07,566 --> 00:33:10,865
Sand Saref has
the blood of Heracles, yes.

408
00:33:11,065 --> 00:33:14,057
But we have what she wants.

409
00:33:14,265 --> 00:33:17,257
- All right, you fatheads listening to me?
- We sure are, boss.

410
00:33:17,466 --> 00:33:21,129
Find Sand Saref, find her now.
Tell her I have no problem with her.

411
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,460
She can have her creepy,
blingy thingy.

412
00:33:25,765 --> 00:33:27,562
Get me that blood.

413
00:33:27,765 --> 00:33:28,857
And keep it safe!

414
00:33:29,065 --> 00:33:31,795
Spill one drop
and I'll turn you all into hamburger.

415
00:33:31,998 --> 00:33:35,456
Don't forget about The Spirit.
He's someone to contend with.

416
00:33:35,665 --> 00:33:40,398
He's like a piece of gum stuck to the
bottom of your shoe that won't let go.

417
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:41,998
You know what I mean?

418
00:33:42,199 --> 00:33:45,362
The kind you step on in the summer
that just won't let go.

419
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:47,397
Am I doing this right?

420
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:49,032
Yeah, looks good.

421
00:33:49,232 --> 00:33:51,325
I was just wondering,
because it really smarts.

422
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:53,466
I hate stepping on gum,
even in winter.

423
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:55,656
Makes you step funny.

424
00:33:56,132 --> 00:33:59,829
We're gonna kill The Spirit,
and we're gonna kill him now.

425
00:34:00,032 --> 00:34:01,294
Or sometime soon.

426
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:03,126
He doesn't publish his address.

427
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,732
We're not going to look for him.

428
00:34:05,932 --> 00:34:08,162
He's gonna come to us. Real soon.

429
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:10,698
You have a plan.

430
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:15,062
I left the man a clue
that will lead him right to us.

431
00:34:15,265 --> 00:34:17,825
Right soon, I promise.

432
00:34:18,032 --> 00:34:20,193
What's the hurries, anyway?

433
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,924
If The Spirit drinks the blood...

434
00:34:23,132 --> 00:34:26,499
...if he so much as realizes
what it could do to him...

435
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:29,132
...what it could turn him into,
then we're finished.

436
00:34:29,532 --> 00:34:31,193
And because I said so.

437
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:33,629
I am a man of my word, Ms. Saref.

438
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,294
Are you?

439
00:34:37,499 --> 00:34:40,764
Take the promises you made
to your lovely new wife.

440
00:34:40,965 --> 00:34:42,933
"Forsaking all others," and all that.

441
00:34:43,132 --> 00:34:45,225
Let's not get personal, shall we?

442
00:34:45,432 --> 00:34:48,094
Oh, we shall.

443
00:34:48,299 --> 00:34:51,791
I commissioned you to find a certain
treasure for me, Mr. Donenfeld.

444
00:34:51,998 --> 00:34:55,024
It was to mark the climax of my career.

445
00:34:55,765 --> 00:34:57,926
Its crown jewel.

446
00:34:58,132 --> 00:35:01,727
The lost treasure of the Argonauts.

447
00:35:01,932 --> 00:35:05,698
And it was even worth me
coming back to this horrid city...

448
00:35:06,332 --> 00:35:08,129
...just to touch it.

449
00:35:08,332 --> 00:35:09,629
To hold it.

450
00:35:09,832 --> 00:35:11,891
To have it be mine.

451
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:16,001
The shiny thing
to end all shiny things.

452
00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:20,029
And I paid you a fortune for it.

453
00:35:20,232 --> 00:35:24,362
And it would've been worth
every nickel, but you screwed me.

454
00:35:24,566 --> 00:35:27,330
So now we're gonna take
every last one of those nickels...

455
00:35:27,532 --> 00:35:29,932
...and transfer them
into another bunch of accounts.

456
00:35:30,132 --> 00:35:32,191
What on earth are you talking about?

457
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:34,299
You're gonna be
quite the philanthropist.

458
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:39,028
Oh, type the numbers in for him,
darling. He seems a tad dyspeptic.

459
00:35:39,232 --> 00:35:42,224
I'm going to need your password,
sweetheart.

460
00:35:50,798 --> 00:35:52,288
All right.

461
00:35:52,499 --> 00:35:53,966
All right.

462
00:35:54,665 --> 00:35:56,326
It's robin.

463
00:35:56,532 --> 00:35:58,466
R-O-B-l-N. Like the bird.

464
00:35:58,665 --> 00:36:00,189
Or like the kid sidekick.

465
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:04,631
You know, the one with the cute
little tights and the tight little derrière.

466
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:07,399
It's going through.

467
00:36:08,798 --> 00:36:09,992
Transfer complete.

468
00:36:11,898 --> 00:36:13,832
Why the devil are you
doing this to me?

469
00:36:14,032 --> 00:36:15,795
You sold me out.

470
00:36:15,998 --> 00:36:18,523
- I didn't have any choice.
- Imagine my surprise...

471
00:36:18,732 --> 00:36:21,792
...when I show up at the drop point
and ran smack into The Octopus.

472
00:36:22,399 --> 00:36:24,458
I mean, what are the odds of that?

473
00:36:25,665 --> 00:36:29,692
Unless you sold
the Argo's treasure twice...

474
00:36:29,898 --> 00:36:33,231
...making a perfect ass of yourself.

475
00:36:35,232 --> 00:36:37,530
A perfect ass.

476
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:40,163
Well, he didn't give me any choice.

477
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:43,123
- He's The Octopus, he threatened my...
- Your family.

478
00:36:44,332 --> 00:36:46,630
Take a good look at those pictures.

479
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:51,098
They'll reach your family and every
news service on the planet...

480
00:36:51,299 --> 00:36:53,927
...unless you render them irrelevant.

481
00:36:57,265 --> 00:36:59,733
At least die bravely...

482
00:37:00,299 --> 00:37:01,994
...rodent.

483
00:37:17,965 --> 00:37:20,024
Hold all calls.

484
00:37:21,466 --> 00:37:23,457
Excuse me, got any change?

485
00:37:28,299 --> 00:37:30,290
What can I say?

486
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,865
Last night you were 20 minutes
from the morgue, and now look at you.

487
00:37:35,032 --> 00:37:36,590
Just look at you.

488
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:42,300
I'd recommend three days' bed rest,
but why waste my breath?

489
00:37:42,498 --> 00:37:44,625
Look who's talking.
You take the night off.

490
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,494
Yeah, I'm sure Mrs. Mahoney's
heart transplant can wait.

491
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:52,135
And we might as well just hold off and
see if old Spankowitz's liver explodes.

492
00:37:52,332 --> 00:37:55,563
You need to have some fun.
Put your feet up, relax.

493
00:37:55,765 --> 00:37:57,357
Maybe go see a show.

494
00:37:59,399 --> 00:38:01,492
What about you, big man?

495
00:38:02,832 --> 00:38:05,426
- What's on your agenda tonight?
- Oh, I don't know.

496
00:38:05,631 --> 00:38:08,122
Things stay quiet,
I'd be up for anything.

497
00:38:08,565 --> 00:38:10,465
- Anything?
- Sure, anything.

498
00:38:10,665 --> 00:38:11,654
Dinner, movie.

499
00:38:12,232 --> 00:38:13,859
Anything.

500
00:38:15,165 --> 00:38:17,531
- So long as things stay quiet?
- Yeah.

501
00:38:17,732 --> 00:38:20,326
- So long as things stay quiet.
- Sure.

502
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:23,591
Like every crook in Central City
goes on sabbatical?

503
00:38:23,965 --> 00:38:27,025
Or maybe if I break the rules.

504
00:38:28,698 --> 00:38:31,030
I feel like breaking all kinds of rules.

505
00:38:31,232 --> 00:38:33,029
- Lower the blinds.
- They're all down.

506
00:38:33,232 --> 00:38:34,927
Oh, fast hands.

507
00:38:35,132 --> 00:38:36,326
And quiet.

508
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:38,863
- And sneaky.
- We'll keep things quiet, all right.

509
00:38:39,232 --> 00:38:40,859
Very, very quiet.

510
00:38:42,698 --> 00:38:46,361
Keep the mask on. Something tells me
it might be better that way.

511
00:38:56,531 --> 00:38:57,896
Oh, Ellen, I lo...

512
00:38:58,099 --> 00:39:01,660
You're in love with every woman
you meet, Mr. Spirit.

513
00:39:03,366 --> 00:39:05,129
You say lovely things to all of us...

514
00:39:06,132 --> 00:39:09,397
...and you mean every word you say.
Every time.

515
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:12,032
Ellen, it's only you.

516
00:39:13,765 --> 00:39:15,596
But we don't even know
your real name.

517
00:39:16,998 --> 00:39:18,898
I'll tell you my name.

518
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:24,565
Someday I'd love to do
your autopsy.

519
00:39:24,765 --> 00:39:26,198
Oh, thanks for the thought.

520
00:39:26,399 --> 00:39:27,866
I'd make a fortune.

521
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:30,192
Spirit! Front and center!

522
00:39:31,665 --> 00:39:34,634
- He's all yours. Fresh as a daisy.
- You should get some sleep.

523
00:39:34,832 --> 00:39:36,993
- You look like hell.
- Love you too, Daddy.

524
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:40,293
It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Spirit.
I'm Morgenstern.

525
00:39:40,498 --> 00:39:43,023
Rookie, fresh from Baltimore.

526
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,160
Good to have you aboard,
Morgenstern.

527
00:39:48,299 --> 00:39:50,494
Come on,
we haven't got the whole day.

528
00:39:57,498 --> 00:40:00,331
- Dr. Dolan, I can't thank you enough.
- Just doing my job, sir.

529
00:40:04,631 --> 00:40:05,757
Bastard.

530
00:40:11,531 --> 00:40:13,431
- Marry me.
- Just doing my job, sir.

531
00:40:13,631 --> 00:40:15,030
And what a job it is.

532
00:40:15,232 --> 00:40:17,462
Central City's own masked manhunter.

533
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,326
You're worshipped by the kids.

534
00:40:19,531 --> 00:40:21,522
Anything you'd care
to share with them?

535
00:40:21,732 --> 00:40:24,701
Play it straight, youngsters.
Don't be too tough on your parents.

536
00:40:24,898 --> 00:40:27,025
<i>They work hard. And remember...</i>

537
00:40:27,232 --> 00:40:28,756
<i>... brush your teeth.</i>

538
00:40:28,965 --> 00:40:30,296
Every word a pearl of wisdom.

539
00:40:30,498 --> 00:40:32,830
<i>Don't forget to remind them
to take their vitamins.</i>

540
00:40:33,032 --> 00:40:34,294
<i>And for the ladies?</i>

541
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:36,489
You know,
we hang on your every word.

542
00:40:36,865 --> 00:40:39,629
<i>Well, I don't think I could say anything
other than thanks...</i>

543
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:43,600
...for being such amazing,
lovely creatures.

544
00:40:43,798 --> 00:40:44,958
<i>No two alike.</i>

545
00:40:48,398 --> 00:40:50,127
<i>Jesus!</i>

546
00:40:51,665 --> 00:40:54,498
- Ever meet a skirt you didn't chase?
- Just trying to be nice.

547
00:40:54,698 --> 00:40:56,131
You've been nice to my daughter.

548
00:40:56,332 --> 00:40:58,493
When will you break her heart,
lounge lizard?

549
00:40:58,698 --> 00:41:01,861
- Lounge lizard? Where do you get off?
- I'll call you anything I want.

550
00:41:02,065 --> 00:41:04,056
I don't know
why I bother talking with you.

551
00:41:04,265 --> 00:41:07,166
Because we fight crime,
and right now we got our hands full.

552
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:11,131
You noticed, have you? Thought with
all the tail you chase, you'd forgotten.

553
00:41:11,332 --> 00:41:12,560
It's The Octopus.

554
00:41:12,765 --> 00:41:15,233
Again with The Octopus.

555
00:41:16,065 --> 00:41:18,590
He's up to something big
and it's got to do with me.

556
00:41:18,798 --> 00:41:20,732
He said some weird stuff
about him and me.

557
00:41:20,932 --> 00:41:23,526
I gotta find out what he's talking about.
It's important.

558
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:25,063
Hold it.

559
00:41:27,665 --> 00:41:29,758
Can we forget about The Octopus
for one minute?

560
00:41:29,965 --> 00:41:31,796
Just one minute?

561
00:41:32,065 --> 00:41:35,228
Now, we got us a hot case
and a murder suspect...

562
00:41:35,431 --> 00:41:37,695
...who's hauling her butt
to the airport.

563
00:41:37,898 --> 00:41:39,525
- Her?
- Name is Sand Saref.

564
00:41:39,732 --> 00:41:41,563
- Sand Saref?
- Sand Saref.

565
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:43,426
- Local girl.
- Only picture of her.

566
00:41:43,631 --> 00:41:44,825
It's over 15 years old.

567
00:41:45,032 --> 00:41:47,000
Father was a cop.
Took one in the face.

568
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:49,133
Disappeared following
her father's murder...

569
00:41:49,332 --> 00:41:51,493
Told some snoop reporter
that she hated cops.

570
00:41:51,698 --> 00:41:54,462
- Right on TV, she said she hated cops.
- She hated cops.

571
00:41:54,665 --> 00:41:56,394
- That's what I said.
- Moved to Europe.

572
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:59,795
Eight marriages later, runs every
jewelry heist this side of Bulgari.

573
00:41:59,998 --> 00:42:01,260
Except for in Central City.

574
00:42:01,465 --> 00:42:03,524
- She never came back.
- You never heard of her.

575
00:42:03,732 --> 00:42:07,190
- You never heard of her, right?
- She never came home.

576
00:42:07,631 --> 00:42:09,929
You on drugs or something?

577
00:42:11,798 --> 00:42:13,356
Come on.

578
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:15,592
Behind the lines, folks.

579
00:42:15,798 --> 00:42:17,561
Behind the lines.

580
00:42:19,365 --> 00:42:21,492
- Commissioner.
- Sand Saref.

581
00:42:21,698 --> 00:42:23,928
She's overseen
hundreds of jewelry robberies...

582
00:42:24,132 --> 00:42:27,499
...and in not one case was
a police officer so much as wounded.

583
00:42:27,698 --> 00:42:29,723
Now, what are the odds
of that, huh?

584
00:42:29,932 --> 00:42:31,524
Sounds like an Electra complex.

585
00:42:31,732 --> 00:42:34,223
- What's that?
- Electra complex. Plain as your face.

586
00:42:34,431 --> 00:42:35,989
Honey, I'm just an <i>alter cocker.</i>

587
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:37,632
Give me something to work with.

588
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:39,622
Old fart.

589
00:42:39,832 --> 00:42:42,426
Jews today. Can't take time
to learn their own language.

590
00:42:42,631 --> 00:42:44,622
Electra complex.

591
00:42:44,832 --> 00:42:48,097
It's like an Oedipal complex
except it's for girls.

592
00:42:48,298 --> 00:42:49,925
She doesn't hate cops.

593
00:42:50,132 --> 00:42:52,191
She's just angry she lost her daddy.

594
00:42:52,398 --> 00:42:55,196
Electra complex, plain and simple.

595
00:42:55,765 --> 00:42:58,666
Damn. This girl's gonna
make detective in no time.

596
00:42:58,865 --> 00:43:00,264
Thank you, sir.

597
00:43:01,298 --> 00:43:04,062
- You like her new jacket?
- Excuse me?

598
00:43:04,265 --> 00:43:06,995
You can't take your
eyes off the ladies.

599
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:10,930
There's no chance in hell you haven't
noticed Morgenstern's new flak jacket.

600
00:43:11,132 --> 00:43:14,761
- Even if you are on drugs.
- I'm not on drugs.

601
00:43:17,132 --> 00:43:19,293
State of the art, these jackets.

602
00:43:19,498 --> 00:43:21,295
We had us a shipment
of these babies...

603
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:23,830
...but we couldn't pay for them
until today...

604
00:43:24,032 --> 00:43:27,195
...when we got a very generous
private donation to the force.

605
00:43:27,398 --> 00:43:29,628
One hundred million dollars
generous.

606
00:43:29,832 --> 00:43:30,821
A lot of money.

607
00:43:31,032 --> 00:43:34,433
You're damn straight it is.
It was like a bolt out of the blue.

608
00:43:34,631 --> 00:43:37,327
An online donation. Anonymous.

609
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:39,021
Yeah, sure, anonymous.

610
00:43:39,232 --> 00:43:42,531
Took our brain boys all of an hour
to track it right back here.

611
00:43:42,732 --> 00:43:45,997
To the offices of an expert
in ancient artifacts.

612
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:49,259
Yeah, who turned said artifacts
into a fortune.

613
00:43:49,465 --> 00:43:51,865
You might say he was a purveyor
of stolen property...

614
00:43:52,065 --> 00:43:55,193
...or, as we put it in the vernacular,
a fence.

615
00:43:55,398 --> 00:43:59,334
A world-class fence
by the name of Donenfeld.

616
00:43:59,531 --> 00:44:00,520
Yeah.

617
00:44:00,732 --> 00:44:06,398
But <i>quelle surprise,</i> old Donenfeld,
he ain't looking so good.

618
00:44:07,099 --> 00:44:09,329
And my good buddy Seth here...

619
00:44:09,965 --> 00:44:11,762
...he says the old man had a visitor...

620
00:44:11,965 --> 00:44:14,331
...just about the same time
he got the hard goodbye.

621
00:44:14,531 --> 00:44:16,761
What did you say her name was
again there?

622
00:44:16,965 --> 00:44:19,195
Sand. Sand Saref.

623
00:44:19,398 --> 00:44:20,956
She didn't have an appointment.

624
00:44:21,165 --> 00:44:24,760
Sand Saref. Some moniker, huh?

625
00:44:24,965 --> 00:44:26,796
Yeah, it's a strange name.

626
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:29,489
- It's one of a kind.
- Yeah.

627
00:44:30,698 --> 00:44:32,393
And my good buddy Seth here...

628
00:44:32,598 --> 00:44:36,056
...he couldn't be bothered
to even call it in.

629
00:44:36,264 --> 00:44:38,323
My hands were tied, officer.

630
00:44:38,531 --> 00:44:40,863
Mr. Donenfeld had a standing order.

631
00:44:41,065 --> 00:44:43,932
I was never to come into his office
unless he called me in.

632
00:44:44,132 --> 00:44:45,690
Never.

633
00:44:45,898 --> 00:44:47,957
Never, ever, ever.

634
00:44:48,165 --> 00:44:50,156
Yeah. Sure, kid.

635
00:44:50,365 --> 00:44:53,664
Morgenstern, get his number.

636
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:58,329
No. Not murder, not her.

637
00:44:58,531 --> 00:45:00,158
It's not possible.

638
00:45:04,598 --> 00:45:07,066
- So you do know her.
- No.

639
00:45:07,264 --> 00:45:09,562
<i>- If you're holding back on me...</i>
- I'm not.

640
00:45:09,765 --> 00:45:12,131
Your whole theory,
it doesn't make any sense.

641
00:45:12,331 --> 00:45:15,994
Hey, it fits together like goddamn
<i>macramé</i> once you factor in her...

642
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:17,928
What'd you call it again there?

643
00:45:18,264 --> 00:45:20,858
- Electra complex.
- Yeah, that.

644
00:45:21,065 --> 00:45:22,327
It's psychobabble.

645
00:45:22,698 --> 00:45:24,666
Trying to hang a murder rap
on that woman...

646
00:45:24,865 --> 00:45:26,457
...over some piece
of psychobabble?

647
00:45:26,665 --> 00:45:30,533
Her name is Sand Saref and you
know her and you're covering for her.

648
00:45:30,732 --> 00:45:33,758
- I never heard of any Sand Saref.
- You're lying!

649
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:36,627
- Get your hand off my arm, Dolan.
- You're lying to me.

650
00:45:36,832 --> 00:45:40,063
Let go of my arm
before I break yours.

651
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:46,327
Orders, sir?

652
00:45:47,665 --> 00:45:48,654
Tail him.

653
00:45:50,431 --> 00:45:52,262
He's lying.

654
00:45:54,965 --> 00:45:58,128
You did a neat little job
up there, Sand.

655
00:45:58,331 --> 00:46:00,356
You shouldn't have signed it.

656
00:46:16,198 --> 00:46:20,862
Officer Morgenstern, you wanna help,
find me a lead to The Octopus.

657
00:46:27,398 --> 00:46:29,059
I will see it.

658
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:32,829
- There.
- I'm in.

659
00:46:38,498 --> 00:46:41,797
And the aces have it.

660
00:46:54,431 --> 00:46:56,524
This I keep as a souvenir.

661
00:46:56,732 --> 00:47:00,293
The rest goes to the man who can
get a message to The Octopus.

662
00:47:11,164 --> 00:47:15,191
<i>I thought I was closing in,
putting it all together.</i>

663
00:47:15,398 --> 00:47:18,231
<i>That three years on,
here in my second life...</i>

664
00:47:18,431 --> 00:47:20,922
<i>... I had a pretty good idea
of what I had to do.</i>

665
00:47:21,131 --> 00:47:23,691
<i>It all got down to me
and The Octopus.</i>

666
00:47:23,898 --> 00:47:25,729
<i>We were headed for a showdown.</i>

667
00:47:25,932 --> 00:47:28,230
<i>I was finally gonna scrub
the city clean of him...</i>

668
00:47:28,431 --> 00:47:29,420
<i>... once and for all.</i>

669
00:47:29,631 --> 00:47:31,496
<i>It wasn't pretty
but it was simple enough.</i>

670
00:47:31,698 --> 00:47:34,064
<i>Then you come along like
a sack of rocks to my face.</i>

671
00:47:34,264 --> 00:47:37,062
<i>What's the story, Sand?
What the heck is going on?</i>

672
00:47:37,264 --> 00:47:39,562
<i>All night, I've been rolling it around
in my skull.</i>

673
00:47:39,765 --> 00:47:42,734
<i>You and The Octopus?
You and murder?</i>

674
00:47:42,932 --> 00:47:44,263
<i>Dolan's gotta be wrong.</i>

675
00:47:44,465 --> 00:47:47,525
<i>There's gotta be more to this,
some explanation.</i>

676
00:47:47,732 --> 00:47:49,700
<i>Not murder, not you.</i>

677
00:47:49,898 --> 00:47:52,264
<i>Can't believe that about you.</i>

678
00:47:52,465 --> 00:47:54,228
<i>You were tough, Sand,
on the outside...</i>

679
00:47:54,431 --> 00:47:56,092
<i>... but inside, you were warm.</i>

680
00:47:56,298 --> 00:47:58,391
<i>And soft.</i>

681
00:47:58,598 --> 00:48:00,964
<i>All woman.</i>

682
00:48:01,565 --> 00:48:03,624
<i>One thing I'd bet
my bottom dollar on:</i>

683
00:48:03,832 --> 00:48:06,323
<i>You wouldn't be caught dead
hiding out in a fleabag...</i>

684
00:48:06,531 --> 00:48:09,056
<i>... like any ordinary
criminal would. No.</i>

685
00:48:09,264 --> 00:48:11,926
<i>No, your taste was
always first-class.</i>

686
00:48:12,865 --> 00:48:14,730
<i>All the way.</i>

687
00:48:18,198 --> 00:48:19,290
<i>Weird.</i>

688
00:48:21,264 --> 00:48:23,459
That's just plain damn weird.

689
00:48:23,665 --> 00:48:26,896
Sir, you promised the new
hyper-addictive synapse accelerant...

690
00:48:27,098 --> 00:48:29,225
...would be ready by last week.

691
00:48:29,431 --> 00:48:32,400
Don't you think
that's plain damn weird?

692
00:48:37,698 --> 00:48:41,134
Yes, sir. Just plain damn weird.

693
00:48:41,331 --> 00:48:43,765
Also, our profits
are down 20 percent.

694
00:48:43,965 --> 00:48:47,366
Good. I was beginning to think
it was just me.

695
00:48:47,565 --> 00:48:49,032
That's plain damn weird.

696
00:48:49,498 --> 00:48:50,522
Yes, sir.

697
00:48:50,732 --> 00:48:53,166
I was trying to make us a smart one...

698
00:48:53,365 --> 00:48:55,663
...and this thing
just sort of popped out.

699
00:48:55,865 --> 00:48:58,595
Twenty percent across the board.

700
00:48:59,932 --> 00:49:03,197
Reduce the price on the old stuff,
we'll make it up in units.

701
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:05,992
Word has hit the streets
about the side effects.

702
00:49:06,198 --> 00:49:09,258
No one likes having their teeth
turned into graham crackers.

703
00:49:10,298 --> 00:49:13,597
How can I get anything done
with all this time on my hands?

704
00:49:13,798 --> 00:49:16,528
Besides, when my buddies here
find Sand Saref...

705
00:49:16,732 --> 00:49:18,791
...I won't need profits,
I'll have the blood.

706
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:21,193
Then if I want something,
I'll just take it.

707
00:49:21,398 --> 00:49:23,298
That's what gods do.

708
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:31,294
He is really damn little.

709
00:49:32,164 --> 00:49:33,392
I mean...

710
00:49:33,598 --> 00:49:35,225
...it's really little.

711
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:38,195
- They can't find her.
- Yeah, we can't find her.

712
00:49:38,398 --> 00:49:40,730
- We looked everywhere.
- Except where she was.

713
00:49:40,932 --> 00:49:42,866
- We should've looked there.
- We did look.

714
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:44,964
- Where's that?
- Kill them all, please.

715
00:49:45,164 --> 00:49:46,426
Just kill them all.

716
00:49:46,631 --> 00:49:47,791
We can't spare them.

717
00:49:47,998 --> 00:49:49,124
- We're running low.
- Yeah.

718
00:49:49,331 --> 00:49:51,265
- You're running low on us.
- Floss said so.

719
00:49:51,465 --> 00:49:53,330
We was listening.

720
00:49:53,531 --> 00:49:55,556
I'm depressed.

721
00:49:56,665 --> 00:49:59,862
I wish The Spirit would come so
I could get me some real killing done.

722
00:50:00,064 --> 00:50:04,763
I told you already,
that's going to be complex.

723
00:50:13,431 --> 00:50:16,662
Spirit thinks he can't stay hurt.

724
00:50:17,365 --> 00:50:21,324
That stuff I put in him and me
is unstable.

725
00:50:21,732 --> 00:50:24,030
Might not last.

726
00:50:24,231 --> 00:50:26,859
The blood will take care of that.

727
00:50:27,398 --> 00:50:32,335
Meanwhile, I'm getting
El Espirito dead while I still can.

728
00:50:32,665 --> 00:50:34,496
To that end...

729
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:37,189
...I got us another opinion.

730
00:50:37,631 --> 00:50:38,859
Brought in a specialist.

731
00:50:40,164 --> 00:50:43,793
Someone to seal the deal.

732
00:51:02,865 --> 00:51:04,332
You speak to my soul, monsieur.

733
00:51:06,198 --> 00:51:09,099
The black-eyed Venus
is in Suite 1510.

734
00:51:12,498 --> 00:51:15,228
Long time no see, Sand.

735
00:51:21,331 --> 00:51:24,528
You gonna arrest me? Or do you have
something else in mind?

736
00:51:24,732 --> 00:51:26,290
I'm bringing you in.

737
00:51:26,498 --> 00:51:28,022
Hands behind your head.

738
00:51:29,832 --> 00:51:30,821
You sure about that?

739
00:51:31,198 --> 00:51:32,665
Don't make me repeat myself.

740
00:51:32,865 --> 00:51:34,662
Hands behind your head.

741
00:51:34,865 --> 00:51:37,231
Your wish is my command.

742
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,356
Okay.

743
00:51:42,565 --> 00:51:45,193
Put a robe on or something
but no tricks.

744
00:51:45,398 --> 00:51:48,026
Yes, sir, Mr. Spirit, sir.

745
00:51:51,798 --> 00:51:54,028
Oh, watch out for my husband,
you'll trip.

746
00:51:56,264 --> 00:51:58,255
Why this?

747
00:51:59,131 --> 00:52:02,225
It's not like I killed him.
He did it to himself about an hour ago.

748
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:04,797
It's all the fault
of this goddamned vase.

749
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:07,329
He tasted the stuff
and, well, see for yourself.

750
00:52:07,531 --> 00:52:10,125
- It's stolen.
- Oh, yeah.

751
00:52:10,331 --> 00:52:12,765
You are a common criminal.

752
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:14,693
There's nothing common about me.

753
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:19,062
You're a criminal. I'm bringing you in
for the murder of a fence, Donenfeld.

754
00:52:19,264 --> 00:52:20,891
If you're gonna lock me up...

755
00:52:21,098 --> 00:52:24,124
...do it over something
I am actually guilty of, stupid.

756
00:52:24,331 --> 00:52:25,593
Oh, you're guilty of a lot.

757
00:52:26,298 --> 00:52:29,927
I could burn a priest's ears
confessing the half of it.

758
00:52:30,131 --> 00:52:32,531
But this time, my hands are clean,
crime fighter.

759
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:35,292
So run on home,
wait for the forensics report.

760
00:52:35,498 --> 00:52:37,864
I haven't shot anybody in days.

761
00:52:38,064 --> 00:52:41,158
There probably isn't a law
on the books that you wouldn't break.

762
00:52:41,365 --> 00:52:43,526
Do I look like a good girl?

763
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:45,855
You don't care who you've hurt?

764
00:52:47,031 --> 00:52:49,022
What's that got to do with anything?

765
00:52:49,231 --> 00:52:53,531
Sand, The Octopus, that fence
and you?

766
00:52:55,031 --> 00:52:57,465
<i>Now, after all of these...</i>

767
00:53:00,598 --> 00:53:02,759
Nothing fits together.

768
00:53:02,964 --> 00:53:05,489
There's that crazy talk
from The Octopus about him and...

769
00:53:05,698 --> 00:53:07,529
Listen, mister...

770
00:53:07,732 --> 00:53:08,721
...I don't care.

771
00:53:08,931 --> 00:53:11,866
I don't even care about people
that I like and I don't know you.

772
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:15,795
No, of course you don't.
But things, now, those you care about.

773
00:53:17,865 --> 00:53:20,299
I don't see what use
I could possibly be to you.

774
00:53:20,498 --> 00:53:23,160
I have nothing to offer
this rotten little town of yours.

775
00:53:23,365 --> 00:53:26,232
As a matter of fact, I despise it.

776
00:53:26,431 --> 00:53:30,026
There's one thing between that river
and that ocean that I came here for.

777
00:53:30,231 --> 00:53:32,290
What? That stupid vase?

778
00:53:32,498 --> 00:53:34,489
It wasn't supposed to be a vase.

779
00:53:34,698 --> 00:53:38,065
It was supposed to be worth
something more than jewels.

780
00:53:38,732 --> 00:53:41,565
Something a little girl's dreams
are made of.

781
00:53:41,964 --> 00:53:44,797
I knew a little girl like that once.

782
00:53:46,131 --> 00:53:48,031
You don't know anything. Get out.

783
00:53:48,231 --> 00:53:51,098
She was a very sweet girl
but the world broke her heart.

784
00:53:51,298 --> 00:53:52,993
She wasn't after any vase.

785
00:53:53,198 --> 00:53:55,962
She was looking for a hero.
Weren't you, little girl?

786
00:53:56,164 --> 00:53:58,189
You were looking for a hero
and his armor.

787
00:53:58,398 --> 00:54:00,696
The only man who would know that
is dead.

788
00:54:00,897 --> 00:54:03,457
The Fleece. The Golden Fleece.

789
00:54:03,665 --> 00:54:04,927
Jason's Golden Fleece.

790
00:54:05,131 --> 00:54:08,259
He's dead.
You're dead. You're dead.

791
00:54:25,298 --> 00:54:27,357
- Will you look at that?
- Don't that beat all?

792
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:28,822
Hey, it's The Spirit.

793
00:54:29,231 --> 00:54:31,699
- He's street pizza.
- He looks stupid.

794
00:54:31,897 --> 00:54:34,923
- Wanker.
- You'll believe a man can't fly.

795
00:54:35,131 --> 00:54:36,496
Jump already.

796
00:54:36,698 --> 00:54:38,359
<i>Jump, jump, jump</i>

797
00:54:38,565 --> 00:54:40,362
<i>Jump, jump, jump</i>

798
00:54:48,864 --> 00:54:51,162
Get me the hell out of here.

799
00:55:02,031 --> 00:55:03,623
Not right now. I'm kind of busy.

800
00:55:03,832 --> 00:55:06,027
It's Morgenstern.
I might have a lead for you.

801
00:55:06,231 --> 00:55:08,165
<i>Nobody noticed all of that salt.</i>

802
00:55:08,365 --> 00:55:09,696
It was right under our noses.

803
00:55:09,897 --> 00:55:12,991
- Could you pick up the pace?
- Salt. Industrial salt.

804
00:55:13,198 --> 00:55:16,065
One of The Octopus' henchmen,
we found him dead near the flats.

805
00:55:16,264 --> 00:55:17,697
Remember where Sussman got shot?

806
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:21,162
Industrial salt,
it was caked all over his shoes.

807
00:55:21,365 --> 00:55:23,663
Dolan was right.
you'll make detective in no time.

808
00:55:23,864 --> 00:55:25,195
Thank you, sir.

809
00:55:25,598 --> 00:55:27,327
I gotta go.

810
00:56:02,331 --> 00:56:03,559
I'll buy you a drink.

811
00:56:03,765 --> 00:56:06,325
All right, folks, show's over.
Time to move on.

812
00:56:06,531 --> 00:56:09,796
Yeah, well, Sand,
that went great, didn't it?

813
00:56:09,997 --> 00:56:13,592
Reunions between old sweethearts
will have to wait.

814
00:56:13,798 --> 00:56:16,892
I got bigger fish to fry.
I'm coming after you, Octopus...

815
00:56:17,098 --> 00:56:20,465
...but before I kill you, you're gonna
answer me some questions.

816
00:56:29,131 --> 00:56:33,568
<i>Morgenstern said there was salt on
his shoes. There's plenty of it here.</i>

817
00:56:35,398 --> 00:56:38,162
<i>Plenty of bad guys too.</i>

818
00:56:38,365 --> 00:56:40,526
<i>All the enemy has
is guns and knives.</i>

819
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:44,891
<i>I have an entire city as my weapon.</i>

820
00:56:50,131 --> 00:56:51,428
<i>My arsenal:</i>

821
00:56:51,631 --> 00:56:54,122
<i>Iron-jawed fire escapes.</i>

822
00:56:54,665 --> 00:56:56,189
<i>Man-made lightning.</i>

823
00:56:57,964 --> 00:56:59,363
<i>Unforgiving pavement.</i>

824
00:57:19,864 --> 00:57:21,923
<i>She provides for me.</i>

825
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:24,664
<i>She protects me.</i>

826
00:57:27,498 --> 00:57:30,262
<i>She is my mother, my city is.</i>

827
00:57:32,331 --> 00:57:33,662
<i>She's a good mother.</i>

828
00:57:36,398 --> 00:57:38,457
<i>She always shows me the way.</i>

829
00:57:46,897 --> 00:57:49,457
What a fine detective.

830
00:57:49,665 --> 00:57:53,157
You followed the breadcrumbs
right to us.

831
00:58:02,031 --> 00:58:04,693
You're not doing anybody good
by falling asleep on the job.

832
00:58:04,897 --> 00:58:07,923
So why don't you go home,
get yourself some proper rest?

833
00:58:08,131 --> 00:58:10,292
You look like something
that the cat dragged in.

834
00:58:10,498 --> 00:58:12,466
So sweet of you to come by, Daddy.

835
00:58:12,665 --> 00:58:16,328
I was just checking in on Sussman.
They wouldn't let me see him. Twits.

836
00:58:16,531 --> 00:58:19,830
Sussman's still in critical,
they're trying to save his spine.

837
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:23,296
Yeah? What's the odds
of him walking again?

838
00:58:23,498 --> 00:58:24,965
Hard to tell.

839
00:58:25,164 --> 00:58:26,597
Miracles do happen.

840
00:58:28,698 --> 00:58:30,427
Damn Spirit.

841
00:58:30,631 --> 00:58:32,656
- He's over the edge.
- Don't go there, Daddy.

842
00:58:32,864 --> 00:58:35,594
- He's a goddamn menace.
- He's something the world needs.

843
00:58:35,797 --> 00:58:36,991
He's a hero.

844
00:58:37,198 --> 00:58:39,962
He's a goddamn menace and my
own daughter's in love with him.

845
00:58:40,164 --> 00:58:42,291
He's why you're killing yourself,
waiting up.

846
00:58:42,498 --> 00:58:45,296
Yes. He's why I'm still here tonight.

847
00:58:45,498 --> 00:58:47,989
Yeah. Just in case
they wheel him in here...

848
00:58:48,198 --> 00:58:50,359
...one more goddamn time.
- Just in case.

849
00:58:50,565 --> 00:58:53,159
So you can lose your youth
stapling his parts back?

850
00:58:53,565 --> 00:58:57,001
I'm not a child.
And I rarely use staples on anybody.

851
00:58:57,598 --> 00:59:00,999
- Can't you see what you're doing?
- I know exactly what I'm doing.

852
00:59:01,198 --> 00:59:03,098
I'm giving him exactly what he needs.

853
00:59:03,298 --> 00:59:05,562
- He's using you.
- He needs me.

854
00:59:05,764 --> 00:59:08,858
I'm the only one who knows his body.

855
00:59:09,064 --> 00:59:10,725
How to treat him.

856
00:59:12,598 --> 00:59:16,056
Plenty of dames who know all about
his body, from what I hear.

857
00:59:16,264 --> 00:59:17,356
That's not what I meant.

858
00:59:17,565 --> 00:59:20,591
Plenty of broads he's stretched across
a gurney or what have you...

859
00:59:20,797 --> 00:59:22,059
...knowing just what to say.

860
00:59:22,264 --> 00:59:24,323
So this is why you came here tonight.

861
00:59:24,531 --> 00:59:26,590
Melting them like butter
with his fingers...

862
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:28,059
That's enough.

863
00:59:28,697 --> 00:59:31,063
Don't make me ask you to leave.

864
00:59:32,997 --> 00:59:35,989
Honey, I don't know
how to talk about this stuff.

865
00:59:37,064 --> 00:59:39,225
You surely don't.

866
00:59:39,665 --> 00:59:44,034
Why do you think I spend my nights
knocking around that house all alone?

867
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:46,929
Guess she had her reasons.

868
00:59:51,465 --> 00:59:53,865
You're married to your job.

869
00:59:54,264 --> 00:59:55,253
So am I.

870
00:59:56,331 --> 00:59:58,026
So is he.

871
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:04,500
You were so much happier
in the old days with Denny.

872
01:00:06,198 --> 01:00:07,631
Denny's dead.

873
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:10,255
Yeah.

874
01:00:11,864 --> 01:00:13,491
Yeah, Denny Colt is dead.

875
01:00:13,697 --> 01:00:16,564
- Sweet kid.
- Yes, he was.

876
01:00:16,864 --> 01:00:19,799
And I'll never forget him
but we keep going.

877
01:00:22,098 --> 01:00:24,293
I lost my Boy Scout.

878
01:00:26,764 --> 01:00:29,597
Yeah. Yeah...

879
01:00:30,231 --> 01:00:32,529
...and I lost my little prom queen, huh?

880
01:00:34,331 --> 01:00:36,993
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Daddy.

881
01:00:37,198 --> 01:00:39,792
I just hope that son of a bitch
knows how lucky he is.

882
01:00:40,864 --> 01:00:42,491
He doesn't.

883
01:00:52,131 --> 01:00:54,292
<i>I can feel you.</i>

884
01:00:54,498 --> 01:00:56,557
<i>You're so weary.</i>

885
01:00:56,764 --> 01:01:01,258
<i>Let me hold you.</i>

886
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:06,325
What smells dental?

887
01:01:10,864 --> 01:01:13,196
Dental and Nazi.

888
01:01:13,398 --> 01:01:14,626
Great.

889
01:01:16,431 --> 01:01:18,126
Oh, no.

890
01:01:22,331 --> 01:01:24,458
Oh, brother.

891
01:01:30,664 --> 01:01:34,828
I've known some pretty strange women
in my time, some darn strange women.

892
01:01:35,031 --> 01:01:36,396
But this one...

893
01:01:36,598 --> 01:01:40,329
...if she is who I think she is,
she's got the final word on strange.

894
01:01:54,565 --> 01:01:57,864
I am Plaster. Plaster of Paris.

895
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:16,628
I will stick to my man.

896
01:02:20,997 --> 01:02:23,557
Till death do us part.

897
01:02:29,697 --> 01:02:31,289
Death.

898
01:02:33,264 --> 01:02:35,824
Death. Death, death.

899
01:02:37,531 --> 01:02:40,523
It's just about all we think about,
isn't it?

900
01:02:40,931 --> 01:02:42,398
We eat...

901
01:02:42,597 --> 01:02:43,825
...so we won't die.

902
01:02:44,031 --> 01:02:47,558
We mate so that
our seed will live on.

903
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:50,232
Create art and build skyscrapers...

904
01:02:50,431 --> 01:02:54,128
...so that our names
will be remembered for centuries.

905
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:06,327
Mr. Long, my good friend,
how are you?

906
01:03:06,531 --> 01:03:08,522
What can I do for you?

907
01:03:08,731 --> 01:03:09,823
A message?

908
01:03:10,031 --> 01:03:12,397
And from whom would that be?

909
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:16,831
Sand Saref. Oh, yes, I know her.

910
01:03:17,098 --> 01:03:20,067
Well, you should've known better
than to play cards with her.

911
01:03:20,264 --> 01:03:22,357
And what would her message be?

912
01:03:22,731 --> 01:03:24,528
The projects?

913
01:03:24,864 --> 01:03:26,661
Out off that old main drag, oh.

914
01:03:26,864 --> 01:03:29,298
Hell, yeah, I know it.

915
01:03:29,498 --> 01:03:30,556
Tomorrow night, then.

916
01:03:31,064 --> 01:03:32,725
Let's say...

917
01:03:32,931 --> 01:03:34,796
...after dinner.

918
01:03:35,564 --> 01:03:37,896
<i>Zai jian,</i> my honored friend.

919
01:03:40,831 --> 01:03:42,799
- Where was I?
- Death.

920
01:03:42,997 --> 01:03:44,089
Death, yes.

921
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:48,158
We live our short...

922
01:03:48,365 --> 01:03:51,493
...frantic, fearful lives,
twisting this way and that.

923
01:03:52,697 --> 01:03:54,460
Music and ambition.

924
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:58,657
Making up gods, afterlives,
all to keep our eyes off...

925
01:03:58,864 --> 01:04:02,527
...that immovable, impassable,
diamond-hard retaining wall...

926
01:04:02,731 --> 01:04:07,566
...that is death,
realizing it will splatter our brains...

927
01:04:07,897 --> 01:04:09,125
...like eggs.

928
01:04:09,331 --> 01:04:11,492
Pardon me,
but is there a point to all this?

929
01:04:11,697 --> 01:04:14,393
Because I'm getting old
just listening to you.

930
01:04:15,098 --> 01:04:17,658
Man, you are really thick.

931
01:04:17,964 --> 01:04:21,400
You just don't get it.

932
01:04:21,597 --> 01:04:24,498
We're two of a kind, you and me.

933
01:04:25,064 --> 01:04:26,725
Ain't neither one of us getting old.

934
01:04:26,931 --> 01:04:29,729
Well, I sure as heck can get bored.

935
01:04:31,731 --> 01:04:34,825
You keep teasing about
how we're two of a kind.

936
01:04:35,031 --> 01:04:37,022
So how's that?

937
01:04:37,497 --> 01:04:39,328
What are we, Octopus?

938
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:41,293
I'm getting to that.

939
01:04:41,497 --> 01:04:42,725
Well, move it along.

940
01:04:42,931 --> 01:04:45,456
Do you remember your death,
pretty boy?

941
01:04:45,664 --> 01:04:47,564
Not the sort of thing a guy forgets.

942
01:04:55,298 --> 01:04:56,595
Yeah, I remember.

943
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:07,200
When they wheeled you in,
you were stone-cold dead.

944
01:05:07,398 --> 01:05:09,923
<i>Not a breath of life in you.</i>

945
01:05:11,131 --> 01:05:13,099
<i>You were perfect.</i>

946
01:05:13,931 --> 01:05:16,957
<i>Dead as Star Trek.</i>

947
01:05:17,164 --> 01:05:20,600
<i>And I was your coroner.</i>

948
01:05:20,797 --> 01:05:25,666
<i>But I was, oh, so much, much
more than that.</i>

949
01:05:25,864 --> 01:05:27,593
I'd built up a righteous drug trade.

950
01:05:27,797 --> 01:05:30,265
It's amazing how much a hospital
doesn't miss.

951
01:05:30,464 --> 01:05:34,059
All you have to do is water it down,
spruce it up and <i>achtung.</i>

952
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:35,253
Swiss bank accounts.

953
01:05:35,664 --> 01:05:38,224
But mere money was never
what The Octopus was after.

954
01:05:39,031 --> 01:05:42,228
All right, so I give up.
What were you after?

955
01:05:43,231 --> 01:05:45,893
Immortality.

956
01:05:46,098 --> 01:05:48,931
All five sweet syllables of it.

957
01:05:49,131 --> 01:05:51,531
There had to be a better way
to keep someone alive...

958
01:05:51,731 --> 01:05:54,598
...other than cutting them open
like some free-range chicken.

959
01:05:54,797 --> 01:05:57,857
Free-range chickens with their big,
brown, ugly-ass eggs.

960
01:05:58,064 --> 01:05:59,053
They piss me off.

961
01:05:59,264 --> 01:06:03,462
Every time I think about those big,
brown eggs, they piss me off.

962
01:06:03,664 --> 01:06:06,189
Or pills.
They're just another way to stall death.

963
01:06:06,398 --> 01:06:08,423
Cling on for a heartbeat.
Hardly the answer.

964
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:10,598
- I got down to basics.
- The essence of life.

965
01:06:10,797 --> 01:06:11,957
- I cracked code.
- Genetics.

966
01:06:12,164 --> 01:06:15,600
- That's how smart I am.
- Yeah, you're a real smart fella.

967
01:06:15,797 --> 01:06:17,992
Thank you. But it wasn't that easy.

968
01:06:18,198 --> 01:06:20,792
And I've got a freezer
full of stray beagles to prove it.

969
01:06:20,997 --> 01:06:24,694
Oh, what that serum did
to those poor dogs...

970
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:26,626
...was just plain wrong.

971
01:06:27,664 --> 01:06:30,258
But when I got it right,
well, I had to try it out.

972
01:06:30,464 --> 01:06:33,763
I wasn't about to try it on myself.
I might've come out looking funny.

973
01:06:33,964 --> 01:06:35,659
I needed a human.

974
01:06:35,864 --> 01:06:37,422
And there I was.

975
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:39,393
And there you was.

976
01:06:39,597 --> 01:06:42,657
I gave you a modest injection
and I waited.

977
01:06:56,597 --> 01:06:59,395
<i>Your second life
began that very night.</i>

978
01:06:59,597 --> 01:07:00,928
<i>Do you remember?</i>

979
01:07:05,964 --> 01:07:07,727
Oh, yeah, I remember.

980
01:07:10,564 --> 01:07:12,623
<i>Somewhere in the midst
of all that praying...</i>

981
01:07:12,831 --> 01:07:14,389
<i>... and whimpering and sniveling...</i>

982
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:17,464
<i>... you must have found
something sharp.</i>

983
01:07:32,365 --> 01:07:34,526
You know, I always wanted to ask:

984
01:07:34,731 --> 01:07:36,722
Where did you go when you got out?

985
01:07:38,098 --> 01:07:40,430
I took a walk.

986
01:07:44,198 --> 01:07:47,099
<i>I had myself a think.</i>

987
01:07:49,530 --> 01:07:51,293
<i>I visited an old friend.</i>

988
01:07:51,497 --> 01:07:55,490
I don't know what happened,
but I still move, I still breathe.

989
01:07:55,697 --> 01:07:58,131
It's impossible, but I'm still alive.

990
01:07:58,931 --> 01:08:01,092
All my life, all I wanted to be
was a good cop.

991
01:08:01,298 --> 01:08:03,129
That's all changed.
Everything's changed.

992
01:08:03,331 --> 01:08:05,925
They're winning, sir.
The bad guys are winning.

993
01:08:06,131 --> 01:08:09,123
I think I've got something more
to fight back with now.

994
01:08:09,530 --> 01:08:12,192
I'm something else now.

995
01:08:12,397 --> 01:08:14,991
I can go places, I can do things
they won't let cops do.

996
01:08:15,198 --> 01:08:18,759
But I can't have any weaknesses.
No name. No friends.

997
01:08:18,964 --> 01:08:20,955
I have to stay dead
in everybody's eyes.

998
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:23,325
Even Ellen's.

999
01:08:23,864 --> 01:08:25,422
But I could be your spy.

1000
01:08:25,931 --> 01:08:28,092
I could work with your men.

1001
01:08:28,298 --> 01:08:31,165
Behind them, in the shadows.

1002
01:08:31,364 --> 01:08:35,300
I could be
the city's protector, its... Its...

1003
01:08:36,231 --> 01:08:37,755
Its spirit.

1004
01:08:38,997 --> 01:08:41,795
Exit hero cop, enter The Spirit.

1005
01:08:42,231 --> 01:08:45,098
Pain in the ass. Tough as nails.

1006
01:08:45,298 --> 01:08:48,324
Eureka!

1007
01:08:48,931 --> 01:08:53,095
So I shot myself up, and we became
brothers under the skin.

1008
01:08:53,298 --> 01:08:56,495
So, what the hell are we, Octopus?

1009
01:08:57,031 --> 01:08:58,896
You're works in progress.

1010
01:08:59,231 --> 01:09:01,791
And once he has the vase
and its contents...

1011
01:09:01,997 --> 01:09:05,262
...its mystic contents,
lost over millennia...

1012
01:09:05,464 --> 01:09:07,830
...he'll drink of it
and he'll become immortal.

1013
01:09:08,031 --> 01:09:09,931
Don't tease.

1014
01:09:10,131 --> 01:09:12,964
Seeing as how I'm gonna die anyway,
clue me in.

1015
01:09:13,164 --> 01:09:14,825
What's in the vase?

1016
01:09:15,031 --> 01:09:17,397
- Thor's hammer?
- No.

1017
01:09:17,831 --> 01:09:19,128
Better.

1018
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:21,457
The DNA...

1019
01:09:21,664 --> 01:09:24,690
...of a god.
- Not a god. Not exactly.

1020
01:09:24,897 --> 01:09:28,799
Yeah, because, you know, humans
and gods, well, they don't mix very well.

1021
01:09:28,997 --> 01:09:33,229
The only route to take is to find the
connection between man and god...

1022
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:35,557
...the child of an immortal
and a human.

1023
01:09:35,764 --> 01:09:39,700
See, Zeus couldn't keep it in his pants,
so he made bags and bags of heroes.

1024
01:09:39,897 --> 01:09:42,229
Now, the greatest of them all
was Heracles.

1025
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:44,557
And we found his ass.

1026
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:47,289
Well, his blood anyway.
He left some blood around.

1027
01:09:47,497 --> 01:09:48,794
And we know where it is.

1028
01:09:48,997 --> 01:09:53,627
So that's the missing link
between science and magic.

1029
01:09:53,831 --> 01:09:58,131
Now, once Heracles' blood mixes
with Octopus' formula...

1030
01:09:58,330 --> 01:10:01,424
- I become a god.
- Or the next best thing.

1031
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:03,461
I become a god.

1032
01:10:03,664 --> 01:10:06,656
And you'll be just one more
sad little byproduct.

1033
01:10:07,164 --> 01:10:09,098
One of his many, many, many failures.

1034
01:10:09,464 --> 01:10:11,932
Come on, now.
Rome wasn't built in a day.

1035
01:10:12,664 --> 01:10:16,293
Besides, look at all the lovely buddies
I've made along the way.

1036
01:10:16,497 --> 01:10:17,486
We was easy to make.

1037
01:10:17,697 --> 01:10:19,528
Yeah, the boss says
we was easy to make.

1038
01:10:19,731 --> 01:10:21,790
But your failures were several.

1039
01:10:21,997 --> 01:10:24,295
And unpleasant.

1040
01:10:24,831 --> 01:10:27,800
Yeah, you know,
you get so much as one little drop...

1041
01:10:27,997 --> 01:10:30,465
...the wrong temperature,
and everything just...

1042
01:10:31,031 --> 01:10:32,623
Let me show you.

1043
01:10:33,098 --> 01:10:34,827
It's kind of sad...

1044
01:10:35,031 --> 01:10:37,431
...but it's really kind of cool too.

1045
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:38,892
This is Muffin.

1046
01:10:40,164 --> 01:10:41,995
She's my favorite.

1047
01:11:10,664 --> 01:11:12,393
We have to have people over
more often.

1048
01:11:12,597 --> 01:11:14,121
I like this.

1049
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:20,355
The cat.

1050
01:11:22,964 --> 01:11:25,865
She is all the reason I need.

1051
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:27,495
I will kill you.

1052
01:11:28,764 --> 01:11:32,131
- Oh, no, you have to die, Spirit.
- Yeah, because you got the juice, man.

1053
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:35,766
Your system's been prepared.
You're the only one the blood won't kill.

1054
01:11:35,964 --> 01:11:38,330
One sip and you could be rendered
as immortal as he.

1055
01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:40,122
The Octopus can be the only one.

1056
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:42,696
There can be no competition
once he's world ruler.

1057
01:11:42,897 --> 01:11:45,127
Yes, then everyone
will have to do what I say.

1058
01:11:45,330 --> 01:11:50,768
They will all have to do what I say
because I will be the ruler of the world.

1059
01:11:50,964 --> 01:11:53,228
Then everything
will start to make sense.

1060
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:55,398
Yes, everything will make sense.

1061
01:11:55,597 --> 01:11:58,065
Everything will start to make sense.

1062
01:11:59,131 --> 01:12:00,826
Let's get back to business.

1063
01:12:01,031 --> 01:12:02,396
Yes, back to business.

1064
01:12:03,530 --> 01:12:05,088
Back to killing your ass.

1065
01:12:06,164 --> 01:12:08,962
Now, here's where things
become a little tricky.

1066
01:12:09,164 --> 01:12:10,927
It's all about integration.

1067
01:12:11,131 --> 01:12:13,759
Now, in your current state,
you heal very quickly.

1068
01:12:13,964 --> 01:12:15,955
Your wounds mend in moments.

1069
01:12:16,164 --> 01:12:20,430
The only solution, it turns out, is to
affect your systemic disintegration.

1070
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:22,530
In short...

1071
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:27,891
...to render you into
so many different parts spread so far...

1072
01:12:28,098 --> 01:12:30,760
...that reintegration
would be impossible.

1073
01:12:32,397 --> 01:12:34,456
And being the man that I am...

1074
01:12:34,664 --> 01:12:38,930
...I like to start from the bottom
and work my way up.

1075
01:12:39,131 --> 01:12:42,066
Floss, bring me those bags.

1076
01:12:47,098 --> 01:12:50,158
I'm going to mail your ass
all over the country.

1077
01:12:51,364 --> 01:12:52,922
Plaster...

1078
01:12:53,131 --> 01:12:54,291
...bring me his toes.

1079
01:12:58,197 --> 01:12:59,596
Plaster.

1080
01:13:13,697 --> 01:13:15,096
Enough of this frog talk.

1081
01:13:15,297 --> 01:13:16,457
I don't understand it.

1082
01:13:17,764 --> 01:13:19,129
Paris...

1083
01:13:19,330 --> 01:13:21,389
...give me his toes.

1084
01:13:21,597 --> 01:13:24,088
That's an order.

1085
01:13:28,364 --> 01:13:29,558
I hate you.

1086
01:13:37,497 --> 01:13:38,794
This is for Sand.

1087
01:13:40,297 --> 01:13:41,457
This is for me.

1088
01:13:41,664 --> 01:13:44,258
And this one's for Muffin.

1089
01:13:52,263 --> 01:13:54,060
That all you got?

1090
01:14:01,263 --> 01:14:02,821
Who is this Sand?

1091
01:14:04,197 --> 01:14:06,563
Not now. Let's go.

1092
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:30,693
The Spirit.

1093
01:14:31,163 --> 01:14:32,824
Plaster.

1094
01:14:44,931 --> 01:14:47,832
And this is for Sand.

1095
01:14:52,797 --> 01:14:56,164
I am Plaster of Paris.

1096
01:14:56,764 --> 01:14:59,699
The toast of Montmartre.

1097
01:15:00,764 --> 01:15:02,823
I will stick to my man.

1098
01:15:03,031 --> 01:15:05,295
Till death do us part.

1099
01:15:10,564 --> 01:15:12,930
<i>You're close now.</i>

1100
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:16,424
<i>Very, very close.</i>

1101
01:15:24,364 --> 01:15:26,798
<i>You can't fight me.</i>

1102
01:15:26,997 --> 01:15:29,625
<i>You. You are mine. Mine. Mine.</i>

1103
01:15:48,330 --> 01:15:50,161
Hey, man, I know the feeling.

1104
01:15:50,364 --> 01:15:52,798
You should meet my wife.

1105
01:15:54,664 --> 01:15:58,259
Just put one foot in front of the other.

1106
01:16:30,297 --> 01:16:32,993
<i>Here we go again.</i>

1107
01:16:33,864 --> 01:16:36,264
<i>I'm dead again.</i>

1108
01:16:38,897 --> 01:16:41,491
<i>The fight's gone out of me.</i>

1109
01:16:44,697 --> 01:16:46,562
<i>I'm ready for you, Lorelei.</i>

1110
01:16:46,764 --> 01:16:48,288
<i>Come.</i>

1111
01:16:48,497 --> 01:16:51,091
<i>Come. Come. Come.</i>

1112
01:16:51,297 --> 01:16:52,696
<i>Come.</i>

1113
01:16:52,897 --> 01:16:55,058
<i>It is time.</i>

1114
01:16:55,330 --> 01:16:57,389
<i>Come. Come.</i>

1115
01:16:58,063 --> 01:17:00,429
<i>No more pain.</i>

1116
01:17:00,831 --> 01:17:03,231
<i>No more suffering.</i>

1117
01:17:04,864 --> 01:17:07,526
<i>Give up the last of it, Denny.</i>

1118
01:17:09,864 --> 01:17:12,264
<i>Give up the ghost.</i>

1119
01:17:13,397 --> 01:17:15,058
<i>Give up the spirit.</i>

1120
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:17,489
<i>Yes, my darling. Yes.</i>

1121
01:17:38,197 --> 01:17:39,630
<i>No.</i>

1122
01:17:41,497 --> 01:17:42,896
<i>It is done.</i>

1123
01:17:43,097 --> 01:17:45,691
<i>It is done. It is done.</i>

1124
01:17:45,897 --> 01:17:47,865
<i>What's it they say about
when you die...</i>

1125
01:17:48,063 --> 01:17:50,463
<i>... about your whole life
flashing before your eyes?</i>

1126
01:17:50,664 --> 01:17:51,926
<i>Forget all that.</i>

1127
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:53,620
<i>All I see are women.</i>

1128
01:17:53,831 --> 01:17:58,666
<i>My sweet Ellen, always there to put
my ragged pieces back together.</i>

1129
01:17:58,864 --> 01:18:00,832
<i>And Sand.</i>

1130
01:18:01,464 --> 01:18:03,227
<i>That poor lost soul.</i>

1131
01:18:05,397 --> 01:18:08,798
<i>Beautiful, beautiful Sand.</i>

1132
01:18:17,797 --> 01:18:21,665
<i>It's so funny my last thought
would be of Sand.</i>

1133
01:18:30,297 --> 01:18:32,060
<i>No.</i>

1134
01:18:32,263 --> 01:18:34,527
<i>Lorelei, you're not for me just yet.</i>

1135
01:18:34,731 --> 01:18:36,995
<i>No, not again.</i>

1136
01:18:37,197 --> 01:18:39,529
<i>They need me. I gotta go back.</i>

1137
01:18:39,731 --> 01:18:42,529
<i>I will always be with you, Denny Colt.</i>

1138
01:18:42,731 --> 01:18:45,723
<i>You won't escape me forever.</i>

1139
01:18:46,197 --> 01:18:48,392
<i>They need me.</i>

1140
01:19:18,931 --> 01:19:20,762
Sand...

1141
01:19:21,097 --> 01:19:22,621
...at the projects.

1142
01:19:24,330 --> 01:19:26,594
Octopus.

1143
01:19:27,831 --> 01:19:30,026
Pieces.

1144
01:19:31,330 --> 01:19:33,662
Pieces of Sand.

1145
01:19:36,797 --> 01:19:38,264
Pieces.

1146
01:19:38,464 --> 01:19:40,227
Pieces of Octopus.

1147
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:42,261
You son of a bitch, Octopus.
You're mine.

1148
01:19:42,464 --> 01:19:43,658
Always with The Octopus.

1149
01:19:43,864 --> 01:19:46,298
- Excuse me, but wasn't he, like...?
- Not right now.

1150
01:19:46,497 --> 01:19:49,398
But three hours with no vitals.
Shouldn't he ought to be dead?

1151
01:19:49,597 --> 01:19:50,791
It's a long story.

1152
01:19:50,996 --> 01:19:53,692
Somebody get me a tie.
And it sure as hell better be red.

1153
01:19:53,897 --> 01:19:56,297
- This time, you better know your place.
- Hold on.

1154
01:19:56,497 --> 01:19:58,795
You're supposed to be my spy,
not some vigilante.

1155
01:19:58,996 --> 01:20:02,261
If you go all cowboy on me again,
I am gonna blast you in half myself.

1156
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:04,455
- You got that?
- I got an idea.

1157
01:20:04,797 --> 01:20:07,698
- I'm atwitter.
- No, it's good.

1158
01:20:07,897 --> 01:20:09,125
I promise.

1159
01:20:14,897 --> 01:20:18,663
Hey, you keep that thing pointed
at The Octopus.

1160
01:20:18,864 --> 01:20:21,059
When I give you the word,
you blow his head off.

1161
01:20:21,263 --> 01:20:23,959
Then it's on with our wedding night,
huh, baby?

1162
01:20:24,163 --> 01:20:26,893
Yeah, baby. Our wedding night.

1163
01:21:19,930 --> 01:21:21,659
Who the hell are you?

1164
01:21:21,864 --> 01:21:25,095
- You The Octopus' girlfriend?
- Oh, no, it's not like that.

1165
01:21:26,130 --> 01:21:27,893
- I mean, this is fun for me.
- Fun?

1166
01:21:28,097 --> 01:21:30,622
We show up here,
we look fabulous doing it...

1167
01:21:30,831 --> 01:21:32,458
...we swap things, then we leave.

1168
01:21:32,664 --> 01:21:35,861
- You're looking to get yourself killed.
- Would you lighten up?

1169
01:21:36,063 --> 01:21:37,792
- Should we start shooting?
- Don't know.

1170
01:21:37,996 --> 01:21:39,964
- No shooting.
- No shooting, you polyp.

1171
01:21:40,364 --> 01:21:42,525
No sign of The Octopus.

1172
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:45,393
Hell of a waste of time
if he didn't show up.

1173
01:21:45,597 --> 01:21:50,091
Whenever he does, sir,
we are locked and loaded.

1174
01:21:50,297 --> 01:21:52,265
That cannon could take out the moon,
rookie.

1175
01:21:52,564 --> 01:21:53,861
Sir, I'm an excellent shot.

1176
01:21:54,063 --> 01:21:56,327
Is every goddamn woman
in this goddamn hellhole...

1177
01:21:56,530 --> 01:22:00,227
...out of her goddamn mind?
- No, sir, we're just equipped.

1178
01:22:00,430 --> 01:22:02,295
Sweetie, he's just using you.

1179
01:22:02,497 --> 01:22:06,797
Sure he is. I run a very lucrative
operation and I'm great eye candy.

1180
01:22:06,996 --> 01:22:09,430
I walk away,
I have my Ph.D. all paid for.

1181
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:11,996
Fine. Tell lug nuts over there
to give me the box.

1182
01:22:12,197 --> 01:22:14,665
And you, you start that walking.

1183
01:22:14,863 --> 01:22:17,491
As far away from that animal
as you possibly can.

1184
01:22:17,697 --> 01:22:21,064
He will kill you. He kills everything.

1185
01:22:21,497 --> 01:22:25,991
All right, fine. I just think you're taking
this way too seriously, that's all.

1186
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:07,464
Give them the vase.

1187
01:23:15,764 --> 01:23:17,629
Boss said I start shooting now.

1188
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:23,991
Get in the truck.

1189
01:23:27,697 --> 01:23:29,289
Nobody goes anywhere.

1190
01:23:30,697 --> 01:23:31,994
Floss...

1191
01:23:32,197 --> 01:23:33,858
...fetch me that vase, please.

1192
01:23:34,063 --> 01:23:35,087
Get in the truck.

1193
01:23:35,530 --> 01:23:39,159
Give me the blood of Heracles, now.

1194
01:23:39,364 --> 01:23:40,626
Walk.

1195
01:23:40,830 --> 01:23:41,888
Heracles?

1196
01:23:44,297 --> 01:23:46,629
I always thought it was "Hercules."

1197
01:23:47,896 --> 01:23:49,523
You.

1198
01:24:09,930 --> 01:24:13,058
Sand, you found your armor.

1199
01:24:13,263 --> 01:24:14,560
Use it.

1200
01:24:14,764 --> 01:24:16,129
What is it with you and women?

1201
01:24:19,996 --> 01:24:21,827
Octopus...

1202
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:23,793
...you were right.

1203
01:24:23,996 --> 01:24:25,588
We're mistakes.

1204
01:24:25,796 --> 01:24:27,388
We never should have happened.

1205
01:24:39,697 --> 01:24:41,665
- Sir, this is crazy.
- Hold your horses.

1206
01:24:41,863 --> 01:24:44,161
He doesn't want any cops
getting killed.

1207
01:24:48,397 --> 01:24:50,991
You're not making this easy.

1208
01:24:58,364 --> 01:24:59,490
Come on, kid.

1209
01:25:09,530 --> 01:25:11,259
It ends tonight.

1210
01:25:12,830 --> 01:25:14,092
You got that right.

1211
01:25:14,564 --> 01:25:16,225
I'm The Octopus.

1212
01:25:16,430 --> 01:25:17,795
I got eight of everything.

1213
01:25:40,464 --> 01:25:42,557
There's shot to hell.

1214
01:25:42,763 --> 01:25:44,390
And shot to hell.

1215
01:25:45,130 --> 01:25:47,928
And there's just plain ridiculous.

1216
01:25:48,397 --> 01:25:50,194
Now.

1217
01:26:10,364 --> 01:26:11,922
You idiot, Octopus.

1218
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:15,622
All we needed was to flush you
and your gunsels out.

1219
01:26:19,664 --> 01:26:21,325
Move, move.

1220
01:26:26,863 --> 01:26:28,262
Give it to him, boys.

1221
01:27:29,330 --> 01:27:31,161
Commissioner Dolan,
your daughter's here.

1222
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:34,092
We need more men over there.

1223
01:27:34,297 --> 01:27:37,061
- Baby, you don't wanna be here.
- You're joking, right, Daddy?

1224
01:27:37,263 --> 01:27:39,993
Have you forgotten what I do
for a living? He might need me.

1225
01:27:40,197 --> 01:27:42,427
You'll be in his way,
he doesn't want you here.

1226
01:27:42,630 --> 01:27:43,790
You don't know that.

1227
01:27:43,996 --> 01:27:47,295
You don't know him.
You don't know a damn thing.

1228
01:27:47,497 --> 01:27:49,260
Stop her. Pull her back.

1229
01:27:49,630 --> 01:27:50,722
Yes, sir.

1230
01:27:56,464 --> 01:27:58,295
Runny eggs.

1231
01:28:10,530 --> 01:28:13,021
Finally. Yes.

1232
01:28:13,230 --> 01:28:14,254
Yes.

1233
01:28:14,464 --> 01:28:18,195
Yeah!

1234
01:28:27,530 --> 01:28:28,895
Wha...?

1235
01:28:34,597 --> 01:28:36,622
Nice investment, Sand.

1236
01:28:36,830 --> 01:28:38,422
Passes its first field test.

1237
01:28:45,996 --> 01:28:47,224
Let's die.

1238
01:28:57,596 --> 01:28:59,723
Oh, God. Oh, God, no.

1239
01:29:00,596 --> 01:29:02,086
No. Oh, God.

1240
01:29:04,263 --> 01:29:05,594
Mother.

1241
01:29:32,963 --> 01:29:35,454
I guess it's time
to finally drop your armor, Sand.

1242
01:29:39,896 --> 01:29:41,989
You lost something.

1243
01:29:45,763 --> 01:29:48,163
Old man Kurtzman said
he'd take it back.

1244
01:29:53,629 --> 01:29:55,062
Well...

1245
01:29:56,063 --> 01:29:58,088
...maybe I'll wear it now and then.

1246
01:29:58,297 --> 01:30:00,561
But it doesn't mean I'm your girl.

1247
01:30:39,197 --> 01:30:41,961
Ellen. Ellen, are you all right?

1248
01:31:12,163 --> 01:31:13,391
Goodbye, Sand.

1249
01:31:14,863 --> 01:31:16,626
Goodbye, Denny.

1250
01:31:40,730 --> 01:31:42,527
Goodbye, Spirit.

1251
01:31:46,097 --> 01:31:47,997
- Is that Saref?
- Give me this one, Dolan.

1252
01:31:48,197 --> 01:31:49,425
Just let her go.

1253
01:31:49,629 --> 01:31:52,325
She saved me.
She saved the world.

1254
01:31:52,529 --> 01:31:55,692
Yeah, well,
you had something to do with it.

1255
01:31:55,896 --> 01:31:58,364
All right. All right.
Just stay out of my face.

1256
01:32:04,197 --> 01:32:06,791
So who the hell was that back there?
Who is she?

1257
01:32:06,996 --> 01:32:08,258
Just an old flame.

1258
01:32:08,464 --> 01:32:10,432
Yeah, she looks old.

1259
01:32:10,629 --> 01:32:13,393
- It's you I love, baby. With all my heart.
- Yeah.

1260
01:32:13,596 --> 01:32:15,860
Me and every other woman
you meet.

1261
01:32:17,163 --> 01:32:19,631
You are amazing.

1262
01:32:19,830 --> 01:32:21,422
Neat work yourself, rookie.

1263
01:32:23,863 --> 01:32:25,763
Bastard.

1264
01:32:50,596 --> 01:32:52,962
We start from scratch.

1265
01:33:02,230 --> 01:33:04,460
Who knows what I'll do?

1266
01:33:12,197 --> 01:33:15,394
<i>She wakes. Grouchy as always.</i>

1267
01:33:16,629 --> 01:33:18,597
<i>Endlessly noisy.</i>

1268
01:33:19,596 --> 01:33:21,962
<i>Endlessly alive.</i>

1269
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:25,364
<i>She's all I really have.</i>

1270
01:33:25,996 --> 01:33:28,260
<i>My only hope.</i>

1271
01:33:29,063 --> 01:33:31,258
<i>My only constant.</i>

1272
01:33:32,996 --> 01:33:35,396
<i>The secrets of The Octopus
died with him.</i>

1273
01:33:38,097 --> 01:33:40,224
<i>I don't know what I am
or how long I got.</i>

1274
01:33:40,429 --> 01:33:42,624
<i>Heck, maybe I'll live forever.</i>

1275
01:33:42,830 --> 01:33:44,354
<i>I hope not.</i>

1276
01:33:44,563 --> 01:33:46,428
<i>That's nothing any man
ought to have.</i>

1277
01:33:46,629 --> 01:33:49,063
<i>That's nothing any man
ought to want.</i>

1278
01:33:49,429 --> 01:33:52,227
<i>Denny Colt is dead.
I'm something else now...</i>

1279
01:33:52,429 --> 01:33:55,364
<i>... and I can never give my heart
to anyone but her.</i>

1280
01:33:55,563 --> 01:33:59,226
<i>She will always be mine
and I will always be hers.</i>

1281
01:33:59,429 --> 01:34:02,125
<i>She owns me, body and soul.</i>

1282
01:34:02,330 --> 01:34:04,924
<i>She is the love of my life.</i>

1283
01:34:05,529 --> 01:34:07,793
<i>She is my city.</i>

1284
01:34:09,796 --> 01:34:11,593
<i>And I...</i>

1285
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:14,126
<i>... am her Spirit.</i>
