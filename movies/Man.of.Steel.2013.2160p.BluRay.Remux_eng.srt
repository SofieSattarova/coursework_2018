1
00:00:57,517 --> 00:00:59,019
Hurry!

2
00:02:10,023 --> 00:02:13,971
Do you not understand?
Krypton's core is collapsing.

3
00:02:14,194 --> 00:02:17,539
We may only have a matter of weeks.
I warned you.

4
00:02:17,797 --> 00:02:21,301
Harvesting the core was suicide.
It has accelerated...

5
00:02:21,534 --> 00:02:24,276
- ...the process of implosion.
- Our energy reserves...

6
00:02:24,504 --> 00:02:26,882
...were exhausted.
What would you have us do, El?

7
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,553
Look to the stars, like our ancestors did.

8
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,690
There are habitable worlds within reach.
We can begin by using the old outposts.

9
00:02:34,948 --> 00:02:38,657
Are you seriously suggesting
that we evacuate the entire planet?

10
00:02:38,885 --> 00:02:42,332
No. Everybody here is already dead.

11
00:02:43,156 --> 00:02:46,694
Give me control of the Codex.
I will ensure the survival of our race.

12
00:02:47,661 --> 00:02:48,731
There is still hope.

13
00:02:48,995 --> 00:02:51,498
I have held that hope in my hands.

14
00:03:06,413 --> 00:03:08,552
This council has been disbanded.

15
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:10,892
On whose authority?

16
00:03:11,251 --> 00:03:12,389
Mine.

17
00:03:17,157 --> 00:03:20,434
The rest of you will be tried
and punished accordingly.

18
00:03:22,429 --> 00:03:25,000
- What are you doing, Zod? This is madness.
- What I should have done...

19
00:03:25,231 --> 00:03:25,902
...years ago.

20
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,201
These lawmakers...

21
00:03:27,434 --> 00:03:28,767
...with their endless debates...

22
00:03:28,768 --> 00:03:29,928
...have lead Krypton to ruin.

23
00:03:33,273 --> 00:03:34,946
And if your forces prevail...

24
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,848
- ...you'll be the leader of nothing.
- Then join me.

25
00:03:38,078 --> 00:03:41,184
Help me save our race. We'll start anew.

26
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:42,449
We'll sever...

27
00:03:42,716 --> 00:03:45,458
...the degenerative bloodlines
that led us to this state.

28
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:48,962
And who will decide
which bloodlines survive, Zod?

29
00:03:50,523 --> 00:03:51,365
You?

30
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:55,600
Don't do this, El.

31
00:03:55,862 --> 00:03:58,308
The last thing I want
is for us to be enemies.

32
00:03:58,565 --> 00:04:01,205
You have abandoned the principles
that bound us together.

33
00:04:01,434 --> 00:04:02,555
You've taken up the sword...

34
00:04:02,702 --> 00:04:04,909
...against your own people.

35
00:04:05,472 --> 00:04:08,385
I will honor the man you once were, Zod...

36
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:10,788
...not this monster you've become.

37
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,423
Take him away.

38
00:04:21,588 --> 00:04:22,931
Sir? Is everything all right?

39
00:04:23,156 --> 00:04:24,464
Out of the way.

40
00:04:25,325 --> 00:04:25,928
I said...

41
00:04:42,809 --> 00:04:43,844
Get me Lara.

42
00:04:45,178 --> 00:04:47,351
Jor. Behind you.

43
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:53,253
Lara, you have to ready the launch.

44
00:04:53,486 --> 00:04:55,159
I'll be with you as soon as I can.

45
00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:11,141
H'Raka!

46
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:23,984
Hyah!

47
00:05:50,577 --> 00:05:53,319
- Can you see the Codex?
- It's just beneath the central hub.

48
00:05:53,546 --> 00:05:54,746
But I'm compelled to warn you.

49
00:05:54,914 --> 00:05:57,224
Breaching the genesis chamber
is a Class-B crime...

50
00:05:57,483 --> 00:06:01,056
Nobody cares anymore, Kelex.
The world is about to come to an end.

51
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:08,893
Jor-El, by the
authority of General Zod...

52
00:07:09,122 --> 00:07:10,999
...surrender the Codex.

53
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:27,607
Unh!

54
00:07:49,262 --> 00:07:50,332
Ahhh!

55
00:07:59,005 --> 00:08:00,541
Easy, H'Raka.

56
00:08:21,494 --> 00:08:22,734
Did you find a world?

57
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:25,649
- We have.
- Orbiting a main sequence yellow star...

58
00:08:25,865 --> 00:08:27,173
...just as you said it would.

59
00:08:28,868 --> 00:08:30,472
A young star.

60
00:08:30,837 --> 00:08:32,510
His cells will drink its radiation.

61
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:37,882
It's a seemingly intelligent population.

62
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:39,881
He'll be an outcast.

63
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,325
A freak.

64
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,357
They'll kill him.

65
00:08:44,584 --> 00:08:46,029
How?

66
00:08:46,886 --> 00:08:48,092
He'll be a god to them.

67
00:08:50,423 --> 00:08:52,562
What if the ship doesn't make it?

68
00:08:53,526 --> 00:08:54,527
He'll die out there...

69
00:08:55,928 --> 00:08:57,271
...alone.

70
00:08:59,065 --> 00:09:00,840
I can't do it.

71
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:02,444
I thought I could, but...

72
00:09:02,702 --> 00:09:04,443
- Lara.
...now that he's here...

73
00:09:04,904 --> 00:09:06,611
Krypton is doomed.

74
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,683
It's his only chance now.

75
00:09:10,376 --> 00:09:11,946
It's our people's only hope.

76
00:09:13,413 --> 00:09:14,619
What is it, Kelex?

77
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:16,861
Five attack ships
converging from the east.

78
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,427
Citadel's defenses
are being scanned and evaluated.

79
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:20,595
I'll upload the Codex.

80
00:09:21,354 --> 00:09:22,765
No, wait.

81
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:24,231
Lara.

82
00:09:24,457 --> 00:09:27,370
Just let me look at him.

83
00:09:30,763 --> 00:09:33,266
We'll never get to see him walk.

84
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,612
Never hear him say our names.

85
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:44,453
But out there...

86
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,621
...amongst the stars...

87
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,482
...he will live.

88
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,848
Goodbye, my son.

89
00:10:50,176 --> 00:10:52,713
Our hopes and dreams travel with you.

90
00:11:31,417 --> 00:11:34,227
Concentrate fire on the main doors.

91
00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:50,547
Lady Lara.

92
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,842
- The phantom drives are coming online.
- Proceed to ignition.

93
00:11:54,607 --> 00:11:55,608
General.

94
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:59,254
We have identified an engine ignition
within the citadel.

95
00:12:00,213 --> 00:12:01,624
A launch.

96
00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:05,194
Hold this platform, commander.

97
00:12:17,597 --> 00:12:19,543
I know you stole the Codex, Jor-El.

98
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,701
Surrender it...

99
00:12:21,934 --> 00:12:23,936
...and I'll let you live.

100
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:27,107
This is a second chance
for all of Krypton...

101
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:29,717
...not just the bloodlines you deem worthy.

102
00:12:31,244 --> 00:12:32,416
What have you done?

103
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:34,955
We've had a child, Zod.

104
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:37,325
A boy child.

105
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:40,587
Krypton's first natural birth in centuries.

106
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:43,261
And he will be free.

107
00:12:43,756 --> 00:12:46,236
Free to forge his own destiny.

108
00:12:47,093 --> 00:12:48,572
Heresy.

109
00:12:50,463 --> 00:12:51,134
Destroy it.

110
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:01,174
Ah!

111
00:13:44,617 --> 00:13:45,618
Lara...

112
00:13:45,785 --> 00:13:47,162
...listen to me.

113
00:13:47,386 --> 00:13:51,027
The Codex is Krypton's future.

114
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,736
Abort the launch.

115
00:14:12,912 --> 00:14:14,687
No!

116
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,884
Your son, Lara...

117
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:49,090
...where have you sent him?

118
00:14:52,585 --> 00:14:54,360
His name...

119
00:14:54,587 --> 00:14:55,691
...is Kal...

120
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:58,198
...son of El.

121
00:15:01,293 --> 00:15:03,637
And he's beyond your reach.

122
00:15:14,273 --> 00:15:15,775
Bring that ship down.

123
00:15:24,116 --> 00:15:25,493
Target locked.

124
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:38,830
Lay down your weapons.

125
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:41,002
Your forces are surrounded.

126
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,589
General Zod...

127
00:15:52,812 --> 00:15:55,588
...for the crimes
of murder and high treason...

128
00:15:55,815 --> 00:15:59,024
...the Council has sentenced you
and your fellow insurgents...

129
00:16:00,186 --> 00:16:03,656
...to three hundred cycles
of somatic reconditioning.

130
00:16:05,157 --> 00:16:06,966
Do you have any last words?

131
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:11,343
You won't kill us yourself!

132
00:16:12,698 --> 00:16:14,837
You wouldn't sully your hands!
But you'll damn us...

133
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,273
...to a black hole for eternity!

134
00:16:19,338 --> 00:16:20,373
Jor-El was right.

135
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,314
You're a pack of fools,
every last one of you.

136
00:16:25,211 --> 00:16:26,383
And you.

137
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:30,559
You believe your son is safe?

138
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:32,990
I will find him.

139
00:16:33,219 --> 00:16:36,530
I will reclaim
what you have taken from us.

140
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,528
I will find him.

141
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,832
I will find him, Lara.

142
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:49,470
I will find him!

143
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:01,052
Argh!

144
00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:33,809
Lady Lara, shouldn't
you find refuge?

145
00:18:34,607 --> 00:18:37,588
There is no refuge, Kelor.

146
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,490
Jor-El was right.

147
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:44,326
This is the end.

148
00:18:56,362 --> 00:18:59,275
Make a better world than ours, Kal.

149
00:20:31,423 --> 00:20:32,925
Watch it, dumb-ass!

150
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:35,695
Keep your eyes open
or you're gonna get squashed.

151
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:40,142
Where the hell did they find you,
greenhorn?

152
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:41,878
Let's get this trap in the air.

153
00:20:42,101 --> 00:20:43,637
Gentlemen, secure the deck.

154
00:20:43,902 --> 00:20:46,906
We just got a distress call
from a rig due west of us.

155
00:20:47,139 --> 00:20:48,447
Secure the deck.

156
00:20:53,145 --> 00:20:54,715
All civilian boats, stand clear.

157
00:20:54,947 --> 00:20:57,621
The sub-sea valves failed
and the rig is about to explode.

158
00:20:57,883 --> 00:21:00,323
Roger, Coast Guard.
What about the men left inside?

159
00:21:00,452 --> 00:21:02,796
- Forget them. They're dead.
- Greenhorn...

160
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:05,092
...fetch me my binoculars.

161
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:07,968
Greenhorn.

162
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:19,839
This is the last of the oxygen. I don't
know how much longer we can hold out.

163
00:21:30,182 --> 00:21:32,982
This is Coast Guard 6510.
We'll make one more pass then get out.

164
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:37,859
Wait, wait.
I got some guys on the helipad.

165
00:21:38,123 --> 00:21:38,763
Right here!

166
00:21:44,263 --> 00:21:46,140
Come on, come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

167
00:21:46,331 --> 00:21:48,140
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

168
00:21:58,677 --> 00:21:59,957
Get that last guy loaded.

169
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:01,489
We have got to go.

170
00:22:01,713 --> 00:22:03,386
Hey, let's go. What are you doing?

171
00:22:09,521 --> 00:22:10,625
Go! Go!

172
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:13,826
Argh!

173
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,002
Argh!

174
00:22:48,527 --> 00:22:50,564
...when Kansas
became a territory?

175
00:22:52,764 --> 00:22:53,742
Clark.

176
00:22:55,734 --> 00:22:56,734
Are you listening, Clark?

177
00:23:01,907 --> 00:23:03,853
I asked if you could tell me who first...

178
00:23:04,076 --> 00:23:05,111
...settled Kansas.

179
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:19,529
Are you all right, Clark?

180
00:23:27,966 --> 00:23:29,377
Clark.

181
00:23:30,602 --> 00:23:31,910
Clark.

182
00:23:35,474 --> 00:23:36,077
Clark!

183
00:23:40,078 --> 00:23:41,614
Clark, come out of there.

184
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,223
Leave me alone.

185
00:23:44,249 --> 00:23:45,819
Clark, I have called your mother.

186
00:23:47,152 --> 00:23:48,222
Clark?

187
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:51,159
Ah!

188
00:23:51,323 --> 00:23:52,324
I'm here.

189
00:23:52,591 --> 00:23:54,571
Clark, honey, it's Mom.

190
00:23:56,962 --> 00:23:57,997
Will you open the door?

191
00:23:58,263 --> 00:24:00,464
- What's wrong with him?
- He's such a freak.

192
00:24:00,465 --> 00:24:01,307
Crybaby.

193
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:04,012
His parents won't even let him play
with other kids.

194
00:24:04,269 --> 00:24:05,270
I know.

195
00:24:05,504 --> 00:24:06,346
Sweetie.

196
00:24:07,506 --> 00:24:09,645
How can I help you if you won't let me in?

197
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:12,252
The world's too big, Mom.

198
00:24:12,477 --> 00:24:14,115
Then make it small.

199
00:24:16,481 --> 00:24:17,755
Just, um...

200
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:21,689
...focus on my voice.

201
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:26,202
Pretend ifs an island...

202
00:24:26,358 --> 00:24:28,269
...out in the ocean.

203
00:24:29,795 --> 00:24:31,103
Can you see it?

204
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,835
I see it.

205
00:24:37,169 --> 00:24:39,171
Then swim towards it, honey.

206
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:54,294
What's wrong with me, Mom?

207
00:24:56,888 --> 00:24:58,390
Clark.

208
00:24:58,657 --> 00:25:00,159
Clark.

209
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,697
- Did you get everything I need?
- Yep.

210
00:25:30,922 --> 00:25:32,595
Hold it, hold it.

211
00:26:22,441 --> 00:26:23,977
Hey, ass-wipe.

212
00:26:24,543 --> 00:26:26,216
What do you think? You see the game?

213
00:26:26,445 --> 00:26:28,948
- Leave him alone, Pete.
- What are you, his girlfriend?

214
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:30,887
I wanna hear what he has to say.

215
00:26:33,251 --> 00:26:33,922
Come on...

216
00:26:34,152 --> 00:26:34,823
...dick-splash.

217
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,821
My son was there.

218
00:28:17,055 --> 00:28:19,262
He was in the bus.

219
00:28:19,524 --> 00:28:22,334
- He saw what Clark did.
- I know he did.

220
00:28:23,261 --> 00:28:27,266
- I'm sure what he thought he saw was...
- Was an act of God, Jonathan.

221
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,711
This was providence.

222
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:36,510
I think you're blowing
it out of proportion.

223
00:28:36,741 --> 00:28:40,018
No, I'm not. Lana saw it too.

224
00:28:40,245 --> 00:28:41,246
And the Fordham boy.

225
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:42,719
This isn't the first time...

226
00:28:42,948 --> 00:28:44,894
...Clark's done something like this.

227
00:29:00,232 --> 00:29:02,075
I just wanted to help.

228
00:29:02,534 --> 00:29:05,276
I know you did, but we talked about this.

229
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:06,811
Right?

230
00:29:07,272 --> 00:29:09,980
Right? We talked about this. You have...

231
00:29:10,475 --> 00:29:13,922
Clark, you have to keep this side
of yourself a secret.

232
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:18,259
What was I supposed to do?
Just let them die?

233
00:29:23,054 --> 00:29:24,465
Maybe.

234
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:30,396
There's more at stake here than just our
lives, Clark, or the lives of those around us.

235
00:29:33,331 --> 00:29:34,742
When the world...

236
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:39,672
When the world finds out what you can do
it's gonna change everything. Our...

237
00:29:39,938 --> 00:29:42,509
Our beliefs, our notions of...

238
00:29:42,774 --> 00:29:45,482
...what it means to be human.
Everything.

239
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:48,520
You saw how Pete's mom reacted, right?

240
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,987
She was scared, Clark.

241
00:29:52,117 --> 00:29:52,959
Why?

242
00:29:54,819 --> 00:29:57,663
People are afraid
of what they don't understand.

243
00:29:57,922 --> 00:29:58,832
Is she right?

244
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:02,802
Did God do this to me?

245
00:30:04,362 --> 00:30:05,864
Tell me.

246
00:30:20,645 --> 00:30:22,318
We found you in this.

247
00:30:24,282 --> 00:30:27,229
We were sure the government
was gonna show up on our doorstep...

248
00:30:27,485 --> 00:30:29,465
...but no one ever came.

249
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,641
This was in that chamber with you.

250
00:30:48,173 --> 00:30:49,550
I took it to a metallurgist...

251
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:51,151
...at Kansas State.

252
00:30:51,376 --> 00:30:53,982
He said whatever it was made from
didn't even...

253
00:30:54,913 --> 00:30:57,689
Didn't even exist on the periodic table.

254
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:00,891
That's another way of saying...

255
00:31:01,052 --> 00:31:03,328
...that it's not from this world, Clark.

256
00:31:05,423 --> 00:31:06,697
And neither are you.

257
00:31:09,394 --> 00:31:10,930
You're the answer, son.

258
00:31:11,196 --> 00:31:13,574
You're the answer to
"Are we alone in the universe?"

259
00:31:15,734 --> 00:31:17,179
I don't wanna be.

260
00:31:17,402 --> 00:31:19,279
And I don't blame you, son.

261
00:31:19,871 --> 00:31:22,579
It'd be a huge burden for anyone to bear.

262
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:26,254
But you're not just anyone, Clark,
and I have to believe that you were...

263
00:31:27,412 --> 00:31:29,255
That you were sent here for a reason.

264
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:33,086
All these changes that you're
going through, one day...

265
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:36,696
One day you're gonna think of them
as a blessing. When that day comes...

266
00:31:36,921 --> 00:31:38,366
...you have to make a choice.

267
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:42,595
A choice of whether to stand proud
in front of the human race or not.

268
00:31:44,362 --> 00:31:47,036
Can't I just keep pretending I'm your son?

269
00:31:47,732 --> 00:31:49,643
You are my son.

270
00:31:54,105 --> 00:31:56,107
But somewhere out there you've...

271
00:31:56,808 --> 00:32:00,051
You have another father too,
who gave you another name.

272
00:32:03,114 --> 00:32:04,035
And he sent you here...

273
00:32:04,215 --> 00:32:05,990
...for a reason, Clark.

274
00:32:07,752 --> 00:32:11,427
And even if it takes you the rest of
your life, you owe it to yourself...

275
00:32:11,656 --> 00:32:13,795
...to find out what that reason is.

276
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,846
Bound by wild desire

277
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:29,108
I fell into a ring of fire

278
00:32:29,274 --> 00:32:31,447
Wait a second.
Aren't you here for the exercise?

279
00:32:31,676 --> 00:32:33,396
No, there was a change in the plans.

280
00:32:33,611 --> 00:32:35,682
Somebody found something
strange on Ellesmere.

281
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:38,921
- Aircom's making runs out there all week.
- That rat hole?

282
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:41,255
- You gotta be kidding me.
- I know. It's crazy.

283
00:32:41,486 --> 00:32:43,193
The Americans are there too,
lots of them.

284
00:32:43,455 --> 00:32:46,290
Anything else? They're
calling it an anomalous object.

285
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:48,532
- Whatever that means.
- Back off, Ludlow. I'm serious.

286
00:32:48,793 --> 00:32:50,634
- Oh, come on, Chrissy.
- Knock it off.

287
00:32:50,829 --> 00:32:52,274
- Sit down.
- Let me go.

288
00:32:52,497 --> 00:32:54,170
Hey. Leave her alone, man.

289
00:32:58,503 --> 00:33:00,210
Or what, tough guy?

290
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:04,185
Or I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

291
00:33:05,376 --> 00:33:08,448
I think I'll probably just leave
when I'm good and ready.

292
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:11,723
Ooh.

293
00:33:18,389 --> 00:33:20,062
Oh, there he is.

294
00:33:27,365 --> 00:33:29,367
It's not worth it, sweetie.

295
00:33:37,509 --> 00:33:39,887
Hey, asshole,
don't forget your tip.

296
00:33:42,046 --> 00:33:43,855
Strike.

297
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,810
Thanks.

298
00:34:36,634 --> 00:34:37,874
Hi.

299
00:34:38,102 --> 00:34:39,809
Miss Lane. How you doing?

300
00:34:40,071 --> 00:34:42,278
- Good.
- Jed Eubanks, Arctic Cargo.

301
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,781
How far to the station?

302
00:34:45,243 --> 00:34:48,315
- Camp's just over the rise. I'll walk you over.
- Great.

303
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,787
Joe can take your bags. Joe.

304
00:34:51,049 --> 00:34:52,289
Help her out.

305
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:55,053
Careful with those. They're heavy.

306
00:34:57,488 --> 00:34:59,126
I gotta confess, Miss Lane...

307
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,234
...I'm not a fan of the Daily Planet.

308
00:35:02,627 --> 00:35:06,598
But those pieces you wrote when you were
embedded with the 1st Division were...

309
00:35:06,831 --> 00:35:08,674
Well, they were pretty impressive.

310
00:35:08,933 --> 00:35:12,904
Well, what can I say? I get writer's block
if I'm not wearing a flak jacket.

311
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,611
Miss Lane.

312
00:35:19,844 --> 00:35:22,484
I'm Colonel Hardy, U.S. Northcom.
Dr. Emil Hamilton...

313
00:35:22,747 --> 00:35:23,851
...from DARPA.

314
00:35:24,115 --> 00:35:25,287
- You're early.
- Hi.

315
00:35:25,516 --> 00:35:26,995
We were expecting you tomorrow.

316
00:35:27,251 --> 00:35:29,697
Which is why I showed up today.

317
00:35:30,355 --> 00:35:32,528
Look, let's get one thing straight,
guys, okay?

318
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:35,634
The only reason I'm here
is because we're on Canadian soil...

319
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:39,307
...and the appellate court overruled
your injunction to keep me away.

320
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:41,669
So if we're done measuring dicks...

321
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:44,277
...can you have your people
show me what you found?

322
00:35:46,337 --> 00:35:47,704
NASA's EOS satellites...

323
00:35:47,705 --> 00:35:49,480
...pinged the anomaly first.

324
00:35:49,707 --> 00:35:52,187
The ice shelf plays hell
on the echo soundings.

325
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:54,787
- But there's something there.
- A submarine, maybe?

326
00:35:55,013 --> 00:35:55,821
Soviet-era?

327
00:35:56,047 --> 00:35:57,651
Doubtful. That's 300 meters.

328
00:35:57,882 --> 00:36:00,863
Considerably larger than anything
we know they built back then.

329
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,359
But herds the spooky pan.

330
00:36:03,554 --> 00:36:06,034
The ice surrounding the object...

331
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:09,362
...it's nearly twenty thousand years old.

332
00:36:10,828 --> 00:36:11,670
Miss Lane?

333
00:36:13,031 --> 00:36:14,305
Try not to wander.

334
00:36:14,532 --> 00:36:17,638
Temperatures drop to minus 40
at night around here.

335
00:36:17,869 --> 00:36:20,145
Wouldn't find your body till after spring.

336
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:24,643
And there you go.

337
00:36:28,212 --> 00:36:29,691
What if I need to tinkle?

338
00:36:30,381 --> 00:36:32,019
There's a bucket in the corner.

339
00:37:06,217 --> 00:37:08,390
Where the hell are you going?

340
00:39:17,715 --> 00:39:19,092
Hello?

341
00:40:54,578 --> 00:40:57,684
It's all right, it's all right,
it's all right. It's all right.

342
00:41:11,996 --> 00:41:13,873
You're hemorrhaging internally...

343
00:41:14,131 --> 00:41:16,509
...and if I don't cauterize this bleed...

344
00:41:17,668 --> 00:41:18,339
How can...?

345
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:21,139
I can do things that other people can't.

346
00:41:22,139 --> 00:41:23,277
Now hold my hand.

347
00:41:24,108 --> 00:41:25,678
This is gonna hurt.

348
00:42:27,371 --> 00:42:29,510
What Colonel Hardy
and his team surmised...

349
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,242
...was a Soviet-era submarine...

350
00:42:31,509 --> 00:42:33,955
...was actually something
much more exotic.

351
00:42:34,211 --> 00:42:38,057
An isotope analysis of the surrounding
ice bores suggests that an object...

352
00:42:38,282 --> 00:42:42,128
...had been trapped in the glacier
for over 18,000 years.

353
00:42:42,386 --> 00:42:43,922
As for my rescuer?

354
00:42:44,188 --> 00:42:46,566
He disappeared during
the object's departure...

355
00:42:46,957 --> 00:42:49,369
A background check revealed
that his work history...

356
00:42:49,593 --> 00:42:51,698
...and identity had been falsified.

357
00:42:51,929 --> 00:42:53,806
The questions raised by my rescuer's...

358
00:42:54,065 --> 00:42:55,908
...existence are frightening
to contemplate...

359
00:42:56,133 --> 00:42:57,771
...but I also know what I saw.

360
00:42:59,703 --> 00:43:02,274
"And I have arrived
at the inescapable conclusion...

361
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,542
...that the object and its occupant...

362
00:43:04,775 --> 00:43:06,721
...did not originate on Earth."

363
00:43:08,446 --> 00:43:11,757
I can't print this, Lois.
You might have hallucinated half of it.

364
00:43:11,982 --> 00:43:14,087
What about the contractors
who corroborated...

365
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:17,492
- ...my story?
- The Pentagon is denying that there was a ship.

366
00:43:17,755 --> 00:43:19,598
Of course they are. They're supposed to.

367
00:43:19,824 --> 00:43:21,326
It's the Pentagon.

368
00:43:21,592 --> 00:43:23,265
Perry, it's me we're talking about.

369
00:43:23,494 --> 00:43:26,168
- I'm a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter.
- Then act like it.

370
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:28,569
- Print it or I walk.
- You can't.

371
00:43:28,799 --> 00:43:29,834
You're under contract.

372
00:43:32,303 --> 00:43:36,308
I'm not running a story
about aliens walking among us.

373
00:43:42,613 --> 00:43:44,183
Never gonna happen.

374
00:43:47,451 --> 00:43:49,829
That's a Scotch, straight-up, for the lady.

375
00:43:50,087 --> 00:43:51,448
I'm sending you the article.

376
00:43:51,622 --> 00:43:54,102
My editor won't print it,
but if it leaked online...

377
00:43:54,325 --> 00:43:55,633
Got it.

378
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,306
But didn't you once describe my site...

379
00:43:58,529 --> 00:44:01,339
...as a creeping cancer of falsehoods?

380
00:44:01,932 --> 00:44:04,503
I stand by my words, Woodburn,
but I want this story...

381
00:44:04,768 --> 00:44:05,940
- ...out there.
- Why?

382
00:44:06,971 --> 00:44:10,316
Because I want my mystery man
to know I know the truth.

383
00:44:24,655 --> 00:44:26,635
Recursive diagnostics complete...

384
00:44:27,458 --> 00:44:29,665
Guiding presence authenticated.

385
00:44:29,894 --> 00:44:32,465
All systems operational.

386
00:44:44,542 --> 00:44:48,490
To see you standing there
having grown into an adult...

387
00:44:50,714 --> 00:44:52,557
If only Lara could have witnessed this.

388
00:44:53,684 --> 00:44:54,890
Who are you?

389
00:44:55,886 --> 00:44:57,866
I am your father, Kal.

390
00:44:59,223 --> 00:45:01,100
Or at least a shadow of him.

391
00:45:01,592 --> 00:45:03,333
His consciousness.

392
00:45:05,095 --> 00:45:08,201
My name was Jor-El.

393
00:45:10,868 --> 00:45:12,506
And Kal?

394
00:45:15,739 --> 00:45:16,945
That's my name.

395
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:21,050
Kal-El. It is.

396
00:45:21,745 --> 00:45:23,782
I have so many questions.

397
00:45:26,517 --> 00:45:28,121
Where do I come from?

398
00:45:29,853 --> 00:45:31,730
Why did you send me here?

399
00:45:32,556 --> 00:45:34,433
You came from Krypton.

400
00:45:37,127 --> 00:45:41,132
A world with a much harsher environment
than Earths.

401
00:45:44,935 --> 00:45:46,573
Long ago...

402
00:45:46,804 --> 00:45:49,045
...in an era of expansion...

403
00:45:49,273 --> 00:45:52,482
...our race spread out through the stars...

404
00:45:52,743 --> 00:45:55,451
...seeking new worlds to settle upon.

405
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:00,084
This scout ship was
one of thousands launched into the void.

406
00:46:02,653 --> 00:46:05,259
We built outposts on other planets...

407
00:46:05,489 --> 00:46:09,232
musing great machines to reshape
environments to our needs.

408
00:46:11,428 --> 00:46:15,433
For 100,000 years,
our civilization flourished...

409
00:46:16,967 --> 00:46:18,969
...accomplishing wonders.

410
00:46:20,137 --> 00:46:21,775
What happened?

411
00:46:23,774 --> 00:46:26,846
Artificial population control
was established.

412
00:46:27,578 --> 00:46:31,185
The outposts on space exploration
were abandoned.

413
00:46:31,782 --> 00:46:34,353
We exhausted our natural resources.

414
00:46:34,618 --> 00:46:38,623
As a result,
our planet's core became unstable.

415
00:46:41,091 --> 00:46:43,628
Eventually, our military leader...

416
00:46:43,861 --> 00:46:47,775
...General Zod, attempted a coup.

417
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,873
But by then it was too late.

418
00:46:53,137 --> 00:46:55,777
Your mother and I foresaw
the coming calamity...

419
00:46:56,006 --> 00:46:58,816
...and we took certain steps
to ensure your survival.

420
00:47:00,878 --> 00:47:02,516
This is a genesis chamber.

421
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:06,520
All Kryptonians were conceived
in chambers such as this.

422
00:47:06,784 --> 00:47:10,493
Every child was designed to fulfill
a pre-determined role in our society...

423
00:47:10,721 --> 00:47:11,563
...as a worker...

424
00:47:11,822 --> 00:47:14,962
...a warrior, a leader and so on.

425
00:47:15,192 --> 00:47:18,469
Your mother and I believed Krypton
lost something precious.

426
00:47:18,696 --> 00:47:20,903
The element of choice, of chance.

427
00:47:21,398 --> 00:47:23,571
What if a child dreamed
of becoming something...

428
00:47:23,834 --> 00:47:26,337
mother than what society
had intended for him or her?

429
00:47:27,871 --> 00:47:30,477
What if a child aspired
to something greater?

430
00:47:31,241 --> 00:47:33,243
You were the embodiment
of that belief, Kal.

431
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:35,990
Krypton's first natural birth in centuries.

432
00:47:37,081 --> 00:47:39,755
That's why we risked so much to save you.

433
00:47:40,884 --> 00:47:42,329
Why didn't you come with me?

434
00:47:45,856 --> 00:47:47,597
We couldn't, Kal.

435
00:47:48,659 --> 00:47:49,660
No matter how much...

436
00:47:49,893 --> 00:47:51,099
...we wanted to.

437
00:47:51,595 --> 00:47:53,597
No matter how much we loved you.

438
00:47:54,365 --> 00:47:55,742
Your mother, Lara, and I...

439
00:47:55,999 --> 00:47:59,105
...were a product of the failures
of our world as much as Zod was...

440
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:01,043
...tied to its fate.

441
00:48:01,271 --> 00:48:03,342
- So I'm alone.
- No.

442
00:48:05,075 --> 00:48:08,750
You're as much a child of Earth now
as you are of Krypton.

443
00:48:09,012 --> 00:48:12,186
You can embody the best of both worlds.

444
00:48:12,416 --> 00:48:16,057
A dream your mother and I
dedicated our lives to preserve.

445
00:48:20,591 --> 00:48:23,572
The people of Earth
are different from us, it's true.

446
00:48:23,794 --> 00:48:26,741
But, ultimately,
I believe that's a good thing.

447
00:48:26,964 --> 00:48:29,410
They won't necessarily
make the same mistakes we did.

448
00:48:29,633 --> 00:48:31,613
Not if you guide them, Kal.

449
00:48:33,203 --> 00:48:35,240
Not if you give them hope.

450
00:48:38,642 --> 00:48:40,815
That's what this symbol means.

451
00:48:41,545 --> 00:48:43,889
The symbol of the house of El
means hope.

452
00:48:44,114 --> 00:48:46,617
Embodied within that hope
is the fundamental belief...

453
00:48:46,884 --> 00:48:50,798
...in the potential of every person
to be a force for good.

454
00:48:51,922 --> 00:48:53,959
That's what you can bring them.

455
00:49:14,144 --> 00:49:15,987
Why am I so different from them?

456
00:49:17,247 --> 00:49:19,750
Earth's sun is younger and brighter
than Krypton's was.

457
00:49:21,652 --> 00:49:24,030
Your cells have drunken its radiation...

458
00:49:24,288 --> 00:49:28,293
...strengthening your muscles,
your skin, your senses.

459
00:49:28,826 --> 00:49:32,831
Earth's gravity is weaker,
yet its atmosphere is more nourishing.

460
00:49:34,131 --> 00:49:37,135
You've grown stronger here
than I ever could have imagined.

461
00:49:37,367 --> 00:49:38,971
The only way to know how strong...

462
00:49:40,037 --> 00:49:43,177
...is to keep testing your limits.

463
00:50:01,959 --> 00:50:02,630
Unh!

464
00:50:10,334 --> 00:50:12,177
Uh... Oh.

465
00:50:13,804 --> 00:50:15,078
Whoa!

466
00:50:35,425 --> 00:50:39,430
You will give the people of Earth
an ideal lo strive towards.

467
00:50:41,098 --> 00:50:42,907
They'll race behind you.

468
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:44,543
They will stumble.

469
00:50:44,768 --> 00:50:45,906
They will fall.

470
00:50:46,169 --> 00:50:47,876
But In time...

471
00:50:49,406 --> 00:50:52,046
...they will join you in the sun, Kal.

472
00:50:53,544 --> 00:50:55,251
In time...

473
00:50:55,579 --> 00:50:58,185
you will help them accomplish wonders.

474
00:52:20,597 --> 00:52:24,545
How do you find someone who has
spent a lifetime covering his tracks?

475
00:52:24,935 --> 00:52:26,539
You start with the urban legends...

476
00:52:26,803 --> 00:52:29,147
- ...that have sprung up in his wake.
- That's Joe.

477
00:52:29,373 --> 00:52:30,784
The friends of a friend...

478
00:52:31,008 --> 00:52:33,010
- ...who have seen him.
- He worked here.

479
00:52:33,276 --> 00:52:36,120
For some he was a guardian angel.
For others, a cipher...

480
00:52:36,346 --> 00:52:38,121
...a ghost who never quite fit in.

481
00:52:39,016 --> 00:52:40,495
Well, I was saying we were...

482
00:52:40,717 --> 00:52:41,957
...coming towards the oil rig.

483
00:52:42,185 --> 00:52:45,325
As you work your way back in time,
the stories form a pattern.

484
00:52:46,056 --> 00:52:48,127
I'm looking for a Pete Ross.
Do you know him?

485
00:52:48,358 --> 00:52:51,202
Yeah, he works at the IHOP.
If you go down the road...

486
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:53,835
Pete Ross?

487
00:52:56,166 --> 00:52:59,375
I'd like to talk to you about an accident
when you were younger.

488
00:52:59,636 --> 00:53:02,139
A school bus that went into the river.

489
00:53:07,644 --> 00:53:09,749
Dusty. Shh-shh-shh.

490
00:53:09,913 --> 00:53:10,983
Mrs. Kent?

491
00:53:11,915 --> 00:53:13,861
I'm Lois Lane. I'm from the Daily Planet.

492
00:53:14,918 --> 00:53:15,658
Quiet.

493
00:53:17,254 --> 00:53:20,724
I'm from the Daily Planet
and I'd like to talk to you about your son.

494
00:53:38,842 --> 00:53:42,847
I figured if I turned over enough stones
you'd eventually find me.

495
00:53:48,418 --> 00:53:51,456
Where are you from?
What are you doing here?

496
00:53:51,722 --> 00:53:53,065
Let me tell your story.

497
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:56,430
What if I don't want my story told?

498
00:53:56,693 --> 00:53:58,468
It's going to come out eventually.

499
00:53:58,729 --> 00:54:01,767
Somebody's going to get a photograph
or figure out where you live.

500
00:54:02,032 --> 00:54:04,979
- Then I'll disappear again.
- The only way you could disappear...

501
00:54:05,235 --> 00:54:09,240
...is to stop helping people altogether,
and I sense that's not an option for you.

502
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:17,415
My father believed that if the world
found out who I really was...

503
00:54:19,416 --> 00:54:20,417
...they'd reject me...

504
00:54:21,151 --> 00:54:22,789
...out of fear.

505
00:54:24,821 --> 00:54:26,892
I'm tired of safe.

506
00:54:27,124 --> 00:54:29,229
I just wanna do something useful
with my life.

507
00:54:29,459 --> 00:54:32,065
So farming, feeding people.
That's not useful?

508
00:54:32,295 --> 00:54:33,295
I didn't say that.

509
00:54:33,396 --> 00:54:35,637
Our family's been farming
for five generations.

510
00:54:35,766 --> 00:54:37,677
Your family, not mine.

511
00:54:37,934 --> 00:54:40,915
I don't even know why I'm listening to you.
You're not my dad.

512
00:54:41,138 --> 00:54:42,515
You're just some guy
who found me in a field.

513
00:54:42,773 --> 00:54:43,945
Clark.

514
00:54:46,309 --> 00:54:47,982
It's all right, Martha.

515
00:54:49,813 --> 00:54:51,918
He's right. Clark has a point.

516
00:54:52,482 --> 00:54:53,517
We're not your parents.

517
00:54:55,619 --> 00:54:57,326
But we've been doing the best we can.

518
00:54:57,587 --> 00:55:00,966
And we've been making this up
as we go along, so maybe...

519
00:55:01,191 --> 00:55:03,603
Maybe our best
isn't good enough anymore.

520
00:55:08,632 --> 00:55:10,669
Look, Dad...

521
00:55:10,934 --> 00:55:12,379
Hold on.

522
00:55:32,122 --> 00:55:33,829
Go for the overpass.

523
00:55:35,625 --> 00:55:36,729
Go for the overpass!

524
00:55:39,062 --> 00:55:40,700
Take cover! Take cover!

525
00:55:40,964 --> 00:55:43,342
- Over there. Just follow them.
- Take cover.

526
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:48,242
She's stuck.

527
00:55:52,809 --> 00:55:54,686
Hank's still in the car.

528
00:55:55,512 --> 00:55:56,547
Hank's in the car.

529
00:55:57,414 --> 00:55:59,553
- I'll get him, I'll get him.
- No, no.

530
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:02,324
Get your mom to the overpass.

531
00:56:20,704 --> 00:56:22,513
Hank! Hank! Come!

532
00:56:31,414 --> 00:56:32,620
Jonathan!
- Mom, ifs okay.

533
00:56:53,637 --> 00:56:55,082
- Jonathan!
- Mom, stay here.

534
00:57:20,897 --> 00:57:23,400
Dad!

535
00:57:25,936 --> 00:57:29,008
I let my father die
because I trusted him.

536
00:57:29,906 --> 00:57:33,820
Because he was convinced
that I had to wait.

537
00:57:34,577 --> 00:57:36,750
That the world was not ready.

538
00:57:38,481 --> 00:57:40,119
What do you think?

539
00:57:45,021 --> 00:57:46,659
You better watch out, Lois.

540
00:57:47,157 --> 00:57:49,467
Hey, Perry's gunning for you.

541
00:57:49,693 --> 00:57:53,470
He knows you're Woodburn's anonymous source
and cannot wait to rip you a new one.

542
00:57:55,832 --> 00:57:57,277
Oh, look at her. Ha, ha, ha.

543
00:57:59,269 --> 00:58:01,806
I told you not to run with this,
and what do you do?

544
00:58:02,038 --> 00:58:04,541
You let Woodburn just shotgun it
all over the Internet.

545
00:58:04,808 --> 00:58:07,687
Now the publishers want me to sue you.

546
00:58:07,944 --> 00:58:11,187
Well, if it makes a difference,
I'm dropping it.

547
00:58:11,448 --> 00:58:12,449
Whoa, just like that?

548
00:58:12,682 --> 00:58:13,683
Yep.

549
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:15,358
What happened to your leads?

550
00:58:16,019 --> 00:58:18,659
They didn't pan out. The story is smoke.

551
00:58:18,888 --> 00:58:20,834
Or it didn't get the traction you hoped?

552
00:58:23,193 --> 00:58:24,035
Two weeks leave...

553
00:58:24,294 --> 00:58:25,898
...no pay, that's your penance.

554
00:58:26,162 --> 00:58:27,835
You try something like this again...

555
00:58:28,064 --> 00:58:29,737
- ...you're done here.
- Fine.

556
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,708
Let's make it three weeks
since you're so willing to agree.

557
00:58:32,969 --> 00:58:34,471
- Perry.
- No, no. Don't. Don't.

558
00:58:36,139 --> 00:58:37,812
I believe you saw something, Lois.

559
00:58:38,308 --> 00:58:41,312
But not for a moment do I believe
that your leads just went cold.

560
00:58:41,544 --> 00:58:45,048
So whatever your reasons are
for dropping it...

561
00:58:46,082 --> 00:58:47,925
...I think you're doing the right thing.

562
00:58:48,485 --> 00:58:49,725
Why?

563
00:58:51,087 --> 00:58:54,728
Can you imagine how people
on this planet would react...

564
00:58:56,993 --> 00:59:00,440
...if they knew there was
someone like this out there?

565
00:59:18,581 --> 00:59:19,582
Go get him.

566
00:59:26,423 --> 00:59:28,061
Well, look at you.

567
00:59:45,108 --> 00:59:46,917
A reporter came by here.

568
00:59:47,477 --> 00:59:49,718
She's a friend. Don't worry.

569
00:59:50,447 --> 00:59:51,790
Oh.

570
00:59:52,715 --> 00:59:53,591
Mom.

571
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:55,491
- Heh, heh, heh.
- What?

572
00:59:56,953 --> 00:59:59,490
- I found them.
- Who?

573
01:00:00,323 --> 01:00:01,825
My parents.

574
01:00:02,992 --> 01:00:04,335
My People.

575
01:00:05,228 --> 01:00:08,437
I know where I come from now.

576
01:00:09,833 --> 01:00:11,107
Wow.

577
01:00:12,168 --> 01:00:13,943
That's wonderful.

578
01:00:15,805 --> 01:00:18,251
I'm so happy for you, Clark.

579
01:00:27,083 --> 01:00:29,620
- What?
- It's nothing.

580
01:00:32,322 --> 01:00:35,269
When you were a baby I used to lay
by your crib at night...

581
01:00:35,492 --> 01:00:37,870
...listening to you breathe.

582
01:00:38,928 --> 01:00:40,532
It was hard for you.

583
01:00:41,764 --> 01:00:43,141
You struggled.

584
01:00:43,366 --> 01:00:45,209
And I worried all the time.

585
01:00:45,468 --> 01:00:47,311
You worried the truth would come out.

586
01:00:48,838 --> 01:00:50,044
No.

587
01:00:51,007 --> 01:00:53,613
The truth about you is beautiful.

588
01:00:54,043 --> 01:00:57,490
We saw that the moment
we laid eyes on you.

589
01:00:59,782 --> 01:01:03,787
We knew that one day,
the whole world would see that.

590
01:01:06,222 --> 01:01:07,860
I'm just...

591
01:01:08,491 --> 01:01:10,562
I'm worried they'll take you away from me.

592
01:01:12,795 --> 01:01:15,173
I'm not going anywhere, Mom.

593
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,502
I promise.

594
01:01:24,707 --> 01:01:26,880
General Swanwick, sir.

595
01:01:27,143 --> 01:01:30,886
What am I looking at, doc?
Comet? Asteroid?

596
01:01:32,048 --> 01:01:36,053
Comets don't make
course corrections, general.

597
01:01:38,855 --> 01:01:42,860
Wanted you to see this before some amateur
with a telescope creates a worldwide panic.

598
01:01:44,527 --> 01:01:45,904
The ship appears to have...

599
01:01:46,162 --> 01:01:48,904
...inserted itself into
a lunar synchronous orbit...

600
01:01:49,165 --> 01:01:51,338
...though I have no idea why.

601
01:01:51,568 --> 01:01:54,412
Have you tried... communicating with it?

602
01:01:54,671 --> 01:01:58,676
Well, they haven't responded as of yet.

603
01:01:59,943 --> 01:02:03,948
I'm just speculating, but I think
whoever's at the helm of that thing...

604
01:02:04,214 --> 01:02:06,717
...is looking to make a dramatic entrance.

605
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:15,070
Anybody know where we keep the toner?

606
01:02:16,025 --> 01:02:17,936
- What's going on?
- It's all over the news.

607
01:02:18,194 --> 01:02:20,140
You gotta see this.

608
01:02:47,123 --> 01:02:48,625
Clark.

609
01:02:48,992 --> 01:02:50,130
Yeah?

610
01:02:50,393 --> 01:02:51,736
Coming.

611
01:02:52,061 --> 01:02:54,262
This is a breaking news. An unidentified...

612
01:03:35,972 --> 01:03:38,043
You are not alone.

613
01:03:39,709 --> 01:03:42,053
You are not alone.

614
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:46,221
You are not alone.

615
01:03:51,888 --> 01:03:54,494
You are not alone.

616
01:04:19,916 --> 01:04:21,477
It's coming in on the RSS feeds.

617
01:04:21,684 --> 01:04:23,561
You are not alone.

618
01:04:24,187 --> 01:04:26,224
It's on my phone too.

619
01:04:28,391 --> 01:04:30,837
My name is General Zod.

620
01:04:32,662 --> 01:04:35,438
I come from a world far from yours.

621
01:04:36,833 --> 01:04:40,838
I have journeyed across
an ocean of stars to reach you.

622
01:04:42,939 --> 01:04:46,944
For some time, your world
has sheltered one of my citizens.

623
01:04:47,577 --> 01:04:50,786
I request that you return
this individual...

624
01:04:51,047 --> 01:04:53,186
...to my custody.

625
01:04:53,416 --> 01:04:57,421
For reasons unknown,
he has chosen to keep his existence...

626
01:04:57,687 --> 01:04:59,530
...a secret from you.

627
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:03,764
He will have made efforts to blend in.

628
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,033
He will look like you.

629
01:05:06,763 --> 01:05:09,369
But he is not one of you.

630
01:05:10,566 --> 01:05:12,409
To those of you who may know...

631
01:05:12,635 --> 01:05:14,637
...of his current location...

632
01:05:14,904 --> 01:05:17,441
...the fate of your planet...

633
01:05:17,707 --> 01:05:20,381
...rests in your hands.

634
01:05:21,444 --> 01:05:24,482
To Kai-El, I say this:

635
01:05:26,549 --> 01:05:29,223
Surrender within 24 hours...

636
01:05:33,489 --> 01:05:36,470
...or watch this world
suffer the consequences...

637
01:05:40,396 --> 01:05:41,067
Ah!

638
01:05:52,241 --> 01:05:54,084
We hardly know anything
about him, isn't that right?

639
01:05:54,243 --> 01:05:56,245
If he truly means us no harm...

640
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:58,481
...he'll turn himself in
and face the consequences.

641
01:05:59,115 --> 01:06:00,321
And if he won't do that...

642
01:06:00,583 --> 01:06:02,585
...then maybe we should.

643
01:06:02,819 --> 01:06:05,800
The Daily Planet's Lois Lane
knows who this guy is. She's...

644
01:06:06,022 --> 01:06:07,422
...the one we should
be questioning.

645
01:06:07,924 --> 01:06:10,666
- Hold on. You're saying Lois Lane...
- Hello?

646
01:06:10,927 --> 01:06:13,430
Are you watching this crap?
Been running all morning.

647
01:06:13,663 --> 01:06:15,973
For once I agree with Woodburn.
Have you seen him?

648
01:06:16,199 --> 01:06:19,510
- Do you know where he is?
- No. Even if I did, I wouldn't say.

649
01:06:19,769 --> 01:06:22,943
The entire world is being threatened here.

650
01:06:23,172 --> 01:06:24,810
This is not time for you to fall...

651
01:06:25,041 --> 01:06:27,385
...back on journalistic integrity.

652
01:06:27,643 --> 01:06:29,122
This is serious, Lois.

653
01:06:29,345 --> 01:06:32,326
The FBI is here. They're throwing around
words like "treason."

654
01:06:32,548 --> 01:06:34,221
I gotta go.

655
01:06:50,366 --> 01:06:51,709
FBI. Hands up.

656
01:06:51,968 --> 01:06:53,743
Drop the bag. Now.

657
01:07:00,643 --> 01:07:03,003
Regarding the visitors
themselves we know...

658
01:07:03,145 --> 01:07:05,591
...very little.
According to government officials...

659
01:07:05,848 --> 01:07:08,328
...the visitors do not
represent a threat...

660
01:07:08,551 --> 01:07:10,724
...despite the ominous tone
of their message.

661
01:07:10,987 --> 01:07:13,490
Then of course there's the question
on everyone's mind:

662
01:07:13,723 --> 01:07:17,535
"Who is this Kai-El person?
Does he actually exist?"

663
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,434
"How could he have remained
hidden from us for so long?"

664
01:07:25,067 --> 01:07:26,375
Come on, Kent.

665
01:07:33,442 --> 01:07:34,546
Come on. Fight back.

666
01:07:34,777 --> 01:07:36,381
Get up, Kent.

667
01:07:39,682 --> 01:07:41,059
So is that it?

668
01:07:41,517 --> 01:07:43,019
Is that all you've got?

669
01:07:44,687 --> 01:07:46,189
Come on, Kent.

670
01:07:47,423 --> 01:07:48,800
Come on!

671
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:18,558
Did they hurl you?

672
01:08:19,822 --> 01:08:21,233
You know they can't.

673
01:08:21,591 --> 01:08:24,470
That's not what I meant.
I meant, are you all right?

674
01:08:26,462 --> 01:08:28,772
I wanted to hit that kid.
I wanted to hit him bad.

675
01:08:28,998 --> 01:08:30,477
I know you did. I mean...

676
01:08:30,733 --> 01:08:33,441
...part of me even wanted you to,
but then what?

677
01:08:34,136 --> 01:08:35,308
Make you feel any better?

678
01:08:38,674 --> 01:08:42,679
You just have to decide what kind of man
you want to grow up to be, Clark.

679
01:08:42,945 --> 01:08:46,654
Because whoever that man is,
good character or bad, he's...

680
01:08:48,284 --> 01:08:50,423
He's gonna change the world.

681
01:08:55,658 --> 01:08:57,019
What's on your mind?

682
01:09:02,765 --> 01:09:04,039
I don't know where to start.

683
01:09:04,667 --> 01:09:06,271
Wherever you want.

684
01:09:08,437 --> 01:09:10,542
That ship that appeared last night.

685
01:09:11,874 --> 01:09:13,683
I'm the one they're looking for.

686
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:19,682
Do you know...

687
01:09:20,483 --> 01:09:21,621
...why they want you?

688
01:09:21,851 --> 01:09:24,457
No. But this General Zod...

689
01:09:24,687 --> 01:09:28,692
...even if I surrender, there's no
guarantee he'll keep his word, but...

690
01:09:28,958 --> 01:09:32,963
...if there's a chance I can save Earth
by turning myself in...

691
01:09:34,563 --> 01:09:35,701
...shouldn't I take it?

692
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:39,076
What does your gut tell you?

693
01:09:39,802 --> 01:09:41,509
Zod can't be trusted.

694
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:45,710
The problem is...

695
01:09:46,742 --> 01:09:49,348
...I'm not sure the people of Earth
can be either.

696
01:09:57,353 --> 01:10:00,334
Sometimes you have to take
a leap of faith first.

697
01:10:01,724 --> 01:10:03,761
The trust part comes later.

698
01:10:27,917 --> 01:10:30,625
All right. You've got our attention.

699
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,121
What is it you want?

700
01:10:32,388 --> 01:10:34,197
I would like to speak to Lois Lane.

701
01:10:34,423 --> 01:10:36,103
What makes you think she's here?

702
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:38,696
Don't play games with me, general.

703
01:10:38,928 --> 01:10:42,933
I'll surrender, but only if you
guarantee Lois's freedom.

704
01:10:53,042 --> 01:10:54,988
Why are you surrendering to Zod?

705
01:10:56,212 --> 01:10:59,819
I'm surrendering to mankind.
There's a difference.

706
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:02,896
You let them handcuff you?

707
01:11:03,619 --> 01:11:06,065
Wouldn't be much of a surrender
if I resisted.

708
01:11:07,556 --> 01:11:09,593
And if it makes them feel more secure...

709
01:11:10,659 --> 01:11:12,502
...then all the better for it.

710
01:11:16,932 --> 01:11:18,104
What's the S stand for?

711
01:11:21,737 --> 01:11:23,307
It's not an S.

712
01:11:24,774 --> 01:11:26,344
On my world it means hope.

713
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:31,814
Well, here, it's an S.

714
01:11:33,849 --> 01:11:35,419
How about...

715
01:11:39,755 --> 01:11:40,756
...Super...

716
01:11:40,990 --> 01:11:42,025
Sir?

717
01:11:42,291 --> 01:11:45,636
- Hi, my name is Dr. E...
- Emil Hamilton.

718
01:11:45,861 --> 01:11:48,842
I know, I can see your ID tag
in your breast pocket.

719
01:11:49,098 --> 01:11:51,135
Along with a half-eaten roll of Lifesavers.

720
01:11:52,301 --> 01:11:54,645
I can also see the soldiers
in the next room...

721
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:57,180
...preparing that tranquilizing agent
of yours.

722
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,884
You won't need it.

723
01:11:59,141 --> 01:12:02,179
Sir, you can't expect us
to not take precautions.

724
01:12:02,444 --> 01:12:04,856
You could be carrying
some kind of alien pathogen.

725
01:12:05,114 --> 01:12:06,559
Been here for 33 years, doctor.

726
01:12:06,816 --> 01:12:10,730
- Haven't infected anyone yet.
- That you know of. We have legitimate...

727
01:12:10,986 --> 01:12:14,365
...security concerns. You revealed
your identity to Miss Lane over there.

728
01:12:15,357 --> 01:12:17,564
Why won't you do the same with us?

729
01:12:18,527 --> 01:12:20,871
Let's put our cards on the table here,
general.

730
01:12:22,331 --> 01:12:24,051
You're scared because you can't control me.

731
01:12:24,633 --> 01:12:27,170
You don't, and you never will.

732
01:12:28,003 --> 01:12:29,983
But that doesn't' mean I'm your enemy.

733
01:12:30,206 --> 01:12:31,708
Then who is?

734
01:12:31,974 --> 01:12:33,385
Zod?

735
01:12:34,009 --> 01:12:35,420
That's what I'm worried about.

736
01:12:36,011 --> 01:12:37,718
Be that as it may...

737
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:40,756
...I've been given orders
to hand you over to him.

738
01:12:41,984 --> 01:12:43,861
Do what you have to do, general.

739
01:12:48,657 --> 01:12:49,431
Thank you.

740
01:12:50,559 --> 01:12:51,537
For what?

741
01:12:52,695 --> 01:12:54,265
For believing in me.

742
01:12:57,333 --> 01:12:59,370
Didn't make much difference in the end.

743
01:13:00,202 --> 01:13:01,738
It did to me.

744
01:13:22,358 --> 01:13:23,894
They're coming.

745
01:13:24,693 --> 01:13:26,195
You should leave now.

746
01:13:29,298 --> 01:13:30,868
Go, Lois.

747
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:43,147
Kal-El.

748
01:14:43,672 --> 01:14:45,709
I'm sub-commander Faora-UI.

749
01:14:46,375 --> 01:14:49,652
On behalf of General Zod,
I extend you his greetings.

750
01:14:55,684 --> 01:14:58,790
- Are you the ranking officer here?
- I am.

751
01:14:59,021 --> 01:15:01,001
General Zod would like this woman...

752
01:15:01,223 --> 01:15:02,861
...to accompany me.

753
01:15:03,826 --> 01:15:05,066
You asked for the alien.

754
01:15:06,395 --> 01:15:09,342
You didn't say anything
about one of our own.

755
01:15:09,565 --> 01:15:12,705
Shall I tell the general
you're unwilling to comply?

756
01:15:12,968 --> 01:15:14,845
I don't care what you tell him.

757
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,251
It's all right.

758
01:15:20,342 --> 01:15:21,548
I'll go.

759
01:16:04,386 --> 01:16:08,232
The atmospheric composition on our ship
is not compatible with humans.

760
01:16:08,457 --> 01:16:09,868
You need to wear a breather...

761
01:16:10,092 --> 01:16:11,765
...beyond this point.

762
01:16:36,919 --> 01:16:37,829
Kal-El.

763
01:16:39,788 --> 01:16:41,426
You have no idea how long...

764
01:16:41,657 --> 01:16:43,728
...we've been searching for you.

765
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,160
I take it you're Zod?

766
01:16:45,427 --> 01:16:46,565
General Zod.

767
01:16:46,795 --> 01:16:48,604
- Our commander.
- It's all right, Faora.

768
01:16:48,831 --> 01:16:51,505
We can forgive Kal any lapses in decorum.

769
01:16:51,767 --> 01:16:53,678
He's a stranger to our ways.

770
01:16:53,936 --> 01:16:54,971
This should be cause...

771
01:16:55,237 --> 01:16:58,275
...for celebration, not conflict.

772
01:16:58,507 --> 01:17:00,680
- Unh.
- Not conflict.

773
01:17:03,112 --> 01:17:04,147
I...

774
01:17:04,413 --> 01:17:05,619
...feel strange.

775
01:17:08,350 --> 01:17:09,658
Weak.

776
01:17:11,854 --> 01:17:13,054
What's happening to him?

777
01:17:13,255 --> 01:17:15,792
He's rejecting our
ship's atmospherics.

778
01:17:16,024 --> 01:17:16,627
Clark.

779
01:17:16,859 --> 01:17:19,533
You've spent a lifetime
adapting to Earth's ecology...

780
01:17:19,695 --> 01:17:20,639
...but never adapted to ours.

781
01:17:20,796 --> 01:17:21,831
Help him.

782
01:17:22,097 --> 01:17:23,633
I can't. Whatever's happening...

783
01:17:23,866 --> 01:17:26,107
- ...has to run its course.
- Clark.

784
01:17:27,469 --> 01:17:28,777
Help him.

785
01:17:30,539 --> 01:17:31,711
Help him.

786
01:17:43,352 --> 01:17:44,888
Hello, Kal.

787
01:17:46,555 --> 01:17:47,625
Or do you prefer Clark?

788
01:17:49,358 --> 01:17:50,735
That's the name they gave you.

789
01:17:50,993 --> 01:17:52,301
Isn't it?

790
01:17:53,562 --> 01:17:55,303
I was Krypton's military leader...

791
01:17:55,531 --> 01:17:57,977
...your father our foremost scientist.

792
01:17:58,200 --> 01:17:59,645
The only thing we agreed on...

793
01:17:59,868 --> 01:18:02,644
...was that Krypton was dying.
In return for my efforts...

794
01:18:02,871 --> 01:18:05,408
...to protect our civilization...

795
01:18:05,674 --> 01:18:07,745
...and save our planet...

796
01:18:08,010 --> 01:18:12,015
...I and my fellow officers
were sentenced to the Phantom Zone.

797
01:18:14,983 --> 01:18:18,226
And then the
destruction of our world...

798
01:18:18,487 --> 01:18:19,989
...freed us.

799
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:28,664
We were adrift, destined to float...

800
01:18:28,897 --> 01:18:30,843
...amongst the ruins of our planet...

801
01:18:31,066 --> 01:18:32,943
...until we starved.

802
01:18:33,835 --> 01:18:35,515
How did you find your way to Earth?

803
01:18:36,205 --> 01:18:40,210
We managed to retrofit
the phantom projector into a hyperdrive.

804
01:18:40,709 --> 01:18:43,883
Your father made a similar modification
to the craft that brought you here.

805
01:18:45,914 --> 01:18:49,020
And so the instrument of our damnation...

806
01:18:51,053 --> 01:18:52,862
...became our salvation.

807
01:18:57,793 --> 01:19:00,296
We sought out the old colonial outposts...

808
01:19:00,562 --> 01:19:02,769
...looking for signs of life.

809
01:19:05,234 --> 01:19:08,044
But all we found was death.

810
01:19:09,037 --> 01:19:11,608
Cut off from Krypton, these outposts...

811
01:19:11,873 --> 01:19:14,080
...withered and died long ago.

812
01:19:14,576 --> 01:19:16,556
We salvaged what we could...

813
01:19:16,778 --> 01:19:18,485
...armor, weapons...

814
01:19:18,747 --> 01:19:20,658
...even a world engine.

815
01:19:22,417 --> 01:19:24,294
For 33 years we prepared...

816
01:19:25,787 --> 01:19:28,563
...until finally we detected
a distress beacon...

817
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:30,599
...which you triggered...

818
01:19:30,826 --> 01:19:33,067
...when you accessed
the ancient scout ship.

819
01:19:34,463 --> 01:19:37,000
You led us here, Kal.

820
01:19:38,133 --> 01:19:39,476
Now it's within your power...

821
01:19:39,735 --> 01:19:43,342
...to save what remains of your race.

822
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:49,350
On Krypton...

823
01:19:49,611 --> 01:19:52,251
...the genetic template
for every being yet to be born...

824
01:19:52,481 --> 01:19:55,018
...is encoded in the registry of citizens.

825
01:19:55,684 --> 01:19:57,823
Your father stole the registry's Codex...

826
01:19:58,086 --> 01:20:00,930
...and stored it in the capsule
that brought you here.

827
01:20:01,623 --> 01:20:02,465
For what purpose?

828
01:20:03,525 --> 01:20:06,267
So that Krypton can live again...

829
01:20:07,129 --> 01:20:08,665
...on Earth.

830
01:20:28,517 --> 01:20:30,622
Where is the Codex, Kal?

831
01:20:32,287 --> 01:20:34,130
If Krypton lives again...

832
01:20:35,290 --> 01:20:36,667
...what happens to Earth?

833
01:20:37,693 --> 01:20:41,197
The foundation has to be
built on something.

834
01:20:41,463 --> 01:20:44,239
Even your father recognized that.

835
01:20:50,706 --> 01:20:53,016
No, Zod.

836
01:20:54,176 --> 01:20:55,382
I can't be a part of this.

837
01:20:56,211 --> 01:20:57,918
Then what can you be a part of?

838
01:20:58,513 --> 01:20:59,719
No!

839
01:21:00,916 --> 01:21:01,519
Zod!

840
01:21:03,018 --> 01:21:03,723
No!

841
01:21:04,886 --> 01:21:06,524
No!

842
01:21:12,561 --> 01:21:13,721
Your father acquitted...

843
01:21:13,929 --> 01:21:15,931
...himself with honor, Kal.

844
01:21:18,834 --> 01:21:20,780
You killed him?

845
01:21:21,169 --> 01:21:22,512
I did.

846
01:21:23,105 --> 01:21:26,518
And not a day goes by
where it doesn't haunt me.

847
01:21:27,876 --> 01:21:30,220
But if I had to do it again, I would.

848
01:21:30,445 --> 01:21:33,915
I have a duty to my people...

849
01:21:34,182 --> 01:21:38,187
...and I will not allow anyone
to prevent me from carrying it out.

850
01:21:54,636 --> 01:21:56,274
What's the sit-rep, major?

851
01:21:56,905 --> 01:21:59,283
DSP pinged two bogeys
launching from the alien ship.

852
01:21:59,541 --> 01:22:01,646
- Put it up.
- Yes, sir.

853
01:22:02,077 --> 01:22:03,147
There it is.

854
01:22:03,412 --> 01:22:04,220
Re-task IKon-4...

855
01:22:04,446 --> 01:22:06,892
- ...and get me a closer look.
- Yes, sir.

856
01:22:07,215 --> 01:22:08,382
Command, the word...

857
01:22:08,383 --> 01:22:09,555
...of the day is trident.

858
01:22:09,785 --> 01:22:11,890
We have two alien craft
on aggressive approach.

859
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,758
Ikon-4 coming online.

860
01:22:13,989 --> 01:22:14,797
Air speed?

861
01:22:15,056 --> 01:22:16,576
380 knots, entering Kansas...

862
01:22:16,725 --> 01:22:18,727
...airspace.
Not responding to our hails.

863
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,167
You're wasting your efforts.

864
01:22:22,097 --> 01:22:24,441
The strength you derived
from the Earth's sun...

865
01:22:24,666 --> 01:22:26,771
...has been neutralized aboard our ship.

866
01:22:27,436 --> 01:22:28,574
Here...

867
01:22:28,804 --> 01:22:30,408
...in this environment...

868
01:22:31,173 --> 01:22:32,652
...you are as weak as a human.

869
01:22:35,243 --> 01:22:36,153
Unh!

870
01:22:40,115 --> 01:22:41,253
Unh!

871
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:33,042
Where did you come from?

872
01:23:33,568 --> 01:23:35,013
The command key, Miss Lane.

873
01:23:35,237 --> 01:23:37,683
Thanks to you, I'm uploading
to the ship's mainframe.

874
01:23:38,907 --> 01:23:39,885
Who are you?

875
01:23:40,842 --> 01:23:42,150
I am Kai's father.

876
01:23:43,812 --> 01:23:44,552
Can you help us?

877
01:23:46,515 --> 01:23:48,358
I designed this ship.

878
01:23:48,583 --> 01:23:50,756
I can modify its atmospheric composition...

879
01:23:51,019 --> 01:23:52,760
...to human compatibility.

880
01:23:53,021 --> 01:23:53,863
We can stop them.

881
01:23:54,089 --> 01:23:56,569
We can send them back
to the Phantom Zone.

882
01:23:57,526 --> 01:23:58,163
How?

883
01:23:58,393 --> 01:23:59,929
I can teach you.

884
01:24:00,195 --> 01:24:02,004
And in turn, you can teach Kal.

885
01:24:02,230 --> 01:24:03,937
Will you help me?

886
01:24:17,779 --> 01:24:19,219
The ship's crew are alerted.

887
01:24:19,347 --> 01:24:20,382
We need to move quickly.

888
01:24:20,615 --> 01:24:22,288
Retrieve the command key.

889
01:24:29,925 --> 01:24:32,963
- Did you do that?
- Yes. Pick up her sidearm.

890
01:24:42,370 --> 01:24:43,747
What's happening?

891
01:25:04,726 --> 01:25:05,397
To your right.

892
01:25:05,627 --> 01:25:06,264
Fire.

893
01:25:07,829 --> 01:25:08,569
Behind you.

894
01:25:22,077 --> 01:25:24,114
Secure yourself inside the open pod.

895
01:25:25,146 --> 01:25:27,422
Safe travels, Miss Lane. It's unlikely...

896
01:25:27,649 --> 01:25:29,253
...we'll see each other again.

897
01:25:30,819 --> 01:25:33,925
Remember, the phantom drives
are essential in stopping them.

898
01:25:34,789 --> 01:25:36,029
Move your head to the left.

899
01:26:03,618 --> 01:26:05,529
Is it true what Zod said about the Codex?

900
01:26:06,655 --> 01:26:08,032
Strike that panel.

901
01:26:11,693 --> 01:26:12,865
We wanted you to learn...

902
01:26:13,128 --> 01:26:15,233
...what it meant to be human first...

903
01:26:15,864 --> 01:26:19,505
...so that one day, when the time was
right, you could be the bridge...

904
01:26:19,734 --> 01:26:21,509
...between two peoples.

905
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:25,013
Look.

906
01:26:28,176 --> 01:26:29,416
Lois.

907
01:26:30,011 --> 01:26:31,046
You can save her, Kal.

908
01:26:34,182 --> 01:26:36,059
You can save all of them.

909
01:27:54,963 --> 01:27:56,499
You'll be safe here.

910
01:27:58,833 --> 01:28:01,404
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

911
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:06,118
I'm sorry.

912
01:28:06,841 --> 01:28:09,822
I didn't wanna tell them anything,
but they did something to me.

913
01:28:10,078 --> 01:28:12,251
- They looked inside my mind...
- It's okay, Lois.

914
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:14,255
They did the same thing to me.

915
01:28:27,328 --> 01:28:28,671
Clark!

916
01:28:37,672 --> 01:28:39,447
The craft he arrived in...

917
01:28:39,974 --> 01:28:41,146
...where is it?

918
01:28:43,044 --> 01:28:44,216
Go to hell.

919
01:28:55,523 --> 01:28:56,501
There.

920
01:28:57,892 --> 01:28:58,563
Unh!

921
01:29:19,514 --> 01:29:21,653
The Codex is not here.

922
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:24,024
Argh!

923
01:29:25,086 --> 01:29:26,588
Ah!

924
01:29:28,389 --> 01:29:29,510
Where has he hidden it?

925
01:29:29,691 --> 01:29:30,328
I don't know.

926
01:29:30,558 --> 01:29:31,662
Where is the Codex?!

927
01:29:35,697 --> 01:29:37,040
Ahh!

928
01:29:47,675 --> 01:29:49,621
You think you can threaten my mother?!

929
01:29:55,216 --> 01:29:56,217
Ah!

930
01:30:31,419 --> 01:30:32,898
What have you done to me?

931
01:30:33,121 --> 01:30:35,567
My parents taught me to hone...

932
01:30:35,790 --> 01:30:37,269
...my senses, Zod.

933
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:40,564
Focus...

934
01:30:41,129 --> 01:30:42,836
...on just what I wanted to see.

935
01:30:43,097 --> 01:30:44,132
Without your helmet...

936
01:30:44,399 --> 01:30:45,969
...you're getting everything.

937
01:30:46,167 --> 01:30:47,077
Unh!

938
01:30:47,235 --> 01:30:48,646
And it hurts...

939
01:30:49,237 --> 01:30:50,614
...doesn't it?

940
01:31:01,482 --> 01:31:02,984
Argh!

941
01:31:35,450 --> 01:31:36,724
Get away from the window.

942
01:31:39,687 --> 01:31:41,496
Get inside. It's not safe.

943
01:31:46,828 --> 01:31:49,707
All players, this is
Guardian. I am airborne mission commander.

944
01:31:49,964 --> 01:31:52,001
I have previously encountered
and observed...

945
01:31:52,233 --> 01:31:54,372
...the beings we're about to engage.

946
01:31:54,635 --> 01:31:57,343
They are extremely dangerous
and we have been authorized...

947
01:31:57,572 --> 01:31:59,074
...to use deadly force.

948
01:32:01,042 --> 01:32:03,082
Roger, Guardian,
we are inbound to target.

949
01:32:08,683 --> 01:32:10,150
Cleared hot. Weapons free.

950
01:32:10,151 --> 01:32:11,755
Copy, 11. Weapons free.

951
01:32:14,555 --> 01:32:15,435
Thunder 11...

952
01:32:15,556 --> 01:32:16,591
...tally three targets.

953
01:32:28,069 --> 01:32:29,104
Unh!

954
01:32:34,208 --> 01:32:35,016
Thunder 11...

955
01:32:35,243 --> 01:32:37,689
...good hit.
Request immediate re-attack.

956
01:32:37,912 --> 01:32:40,113
Roger, Guardian.
We'll make a second gun run...

957
01:32:40,281 --> 01:32:42,386
...on a heading of 212 degrees.

958
01:32:49,390 --> 01:32:50,471
Thunder 11, eject!

959
01:32:50,591 --> 01:32:51,968
Eject!

960
01:32:52,293 --> 01:32:53,931
Thunder 11, eject!

961
01:33:04,072 --> 01:33:05,642
I have a bogey incoming!

962
01:33:06,474 --> 01:33:07,919
Oh, shit.

963
01:33:22,824 --> 01:33:23,564
Argh!

964
01:33:26,094 --> 01:33:26,970
You are weak...

965
01:33:27,228 --> 01:33:28,332
...son of El.

966
01:33:28,596 --> 01:33:29,734
Unsure of yourself.

967
01:33:34,969 --> 01:33:37,950
The fact that you possess
a sense of morality...

968
01:33:38,172 --> 01:33:39,947
...and we do not...

969
01:33:40,174 --> 01:33:42,745
...gives us an evolutionary advantage.

970
01:33:46,247 --> 01:33:48,750
And if history has proven anything...

971
01:33:58,626 --> 01:34:02,199
...it is that evolution always wins.

972
01:34:03,865 --> 01:34:04,536
Ragh!

973
01:34:09,303 --> 01:34:10,475
Unh!

974
01:34:23,518 --> 01:34:25,020
CCT, we're approaching...

975
01:34:25,286 --> 01:34:27,129
...LZ Jayhawk. Get down in five.

976
01:34:27,355 --> 01:34:29,198
Let's go. Go to the LZ.

977
01:34:29,991 --> 01:34:31,312
Roger, sarge. let's go!

978
01:35:08,763 --> 01:35:10,084
All rangers, I need you...

979
01:35:10,331 --> 01:35:11,503
...to engage the targets.

980
01:35:11,999 --> 01:35:13,120
Guardian, this is Badger 01.

981
01:35:13,334 --> 01:35:14,608
What about the guy in blue?

982
01:35:14,869 --> 01:35:15,904
I said engage...

983
01:35:16,170 --> 01:35:17,342
...all targets.

984
01:35:28,516 --> 01:35:29,556
Contact. Contact.

985
01:35:33,921 --> 01:35:34,797
Ah!

986
01:35:39,727 --> 01:35:40,569
You okay?

987
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:48,405
We're auto-rotating, going in hard.

988
01:35:49,136 --> 01:35:50,308
Brace for impact.

989
01:35:51,105 --> 01:35:52,243
Brace for impact.

990
01:35:52,473 --> 01:35:53,451
We're going in hard!

991
01:35:58,546 --> 01:36:02,551
Fallen angel. Fallen angel. Guardian
is down. I repeat, Guardian is down.

992
01:36:24,472 --> 01:36:25,974
Guardian, do you read?

993
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:27,583
Thunder 12, calling Guardian.

994
01:36:27,808 --> 01:36:29,151
- Do you read?
- Thunder 12...

995
01:36:29,410 --> 01:36:30,320
...this is Guardian.

996
01:36:30,578 --> 01:36:32,956
Put down everything you've got
north of my position.

997
01:36:33,180 --> 01:36:35,353
- This will be danger-close.
- Copy, danger-close.

998
01:36:35,616 --> 01:36:36,856
Good luck, sir.

999
01:37:16,724 --> 01:37:19,568
A good death is its own reward.

1000
01:37:33,174 --> 01:37:34,551
You will not win.

1001
01:37:35,976 --> 01:37:37,512
For every human you save...

1002
01:37:37,745 --> 01:37:40,419
...we will kill a million more. Unh!

1003
01:38:31,732 --> 01:38:34,906
Do we have an all clear?
Do we have an all clear?

1004
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:37,412
Alpha team, sit-rep. Alpha team.

1005
01:38:37,638 --> 01:38:39,242
Do you copy? Alpha team.

1006
01:39:28,756 --> 01:39:30,963
This man is not our enemy.

1007
01:39:33,427 --> 01:39:34,963
Thank you, colonel.

1008
01:39:52,813 --> 01:39:53,655
Mom?

1009
01:39:54,949 --> 01:39:56,622
I'm all right.

1010
01:40:08,662 --> 01:40:10,642
Nice suit, son.

1011
01:40:11,699 --> 01:40:13,007
I'm so sorry.

1012
01:40:14,034 --> 01:40:16,344
It's only stuff, Clark.

1013
01:40:17,505 --> 01:40:19,917
It can always be replaced.

1014
01:40:22,376 --> 01:40:23,650
But you can't be.

1015
01:40:24,979 --> 01:40:27,391
Mom, Zod said this Codex...

1016
01:40:27,648 --> 01:40:29,924
...he's looking for can
bring my people back.

1017
01:40:30,251 --> 01:40:31,924
Isn't that a good thing?

1018
01:40:36,156 --> 01:40:38,659
I don't think they're interested
in sharing this world.

1019
01:40:39,260 --> 01:40:40,500
Clark.

1020
01:40:41,228 --> 01:40:42,104
Clark.

1021
01:40:43,998 --> 01:40:45,875
I know how to stop them.

1022
01:40:47,935 --> 01:40:49,380
What happened down there?

1023
01:40:49,603 --> 01:40:52,447
He exposed a temporary weakness.

1024
01:40:53,340 --> 01:40:55,183
It is of little consequence...

1025
01:40:56,544 --> 01:40:59,457
...because I have located the Codex.

1026
01:41:00,247 --> 01:41:02,523
It was never in the capsule.

1027
01:41:03,117 --> 01:41:04,790
Jor-el took the Codex...

1028
01:41:05,052 --> 01:41:07,532
...the DNA of a billion people,
then he bonded it...

1029
01:41:07,755 --> 01:41:09,564
...within his son's individual...

1030
01:41:09,790 --> 01:41:10,734
...cells.

1031
01:41:10,958 --> 01:41:12,562
All of Krypton's heirs...

1032
01:41:12,793 --> 01:41:16,240
...living hidden in one refugee's body.

1033
01:41:20,301 --> 01:41:22,281
Does Kal-El need to be alive...

1034
01:41:22,536 --> 01:41:25,710
...for us to extract the
Codex from his cells?

1035
01:41:27,074 --> 01:41:28,246
No.

1036
01:41:34,148 --> 01:41:36,424
Release the world engine.

1037
01:42:08,649 --> 01:42:09,593
What just happened?

1038
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:10,922
The ship just split in two.

1039
01:42:11,151 --> 01:42:14,257
Track one is heading east,
track two to the southern hemisphere.

1040
01:42:14,488 --> 01:42:17,156
- How fast is that bogey moving?
- Approaching...

1041
01:42:17,157 --> 01:42:18,602
...Mach 24 and accelerating.

1042
01:42:18,826 --> 01:42:21,500
It's gonna impact
somewhere in the Indian Ocean.

1043
01:42:40,214 --> 01:42:41,852
The rest of the ship is descending.

1044
01:42:42,850 --> 01:42:44,217
Put it on the board now.

1045
01:42:44,218 --> 01:42:45,288
Yes, sir.

1046
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:47,492
Oh, my God.

1047
01:43:27,995 --> 01:43:30,771
Bring the phantom drive online.

1048
01:43:52,386 --> 01:43:54,229
We are now slave to the world engine.

1049
01:43:55,956 --> 01:43:57,367
Initiate.

1050
01:44:31,425 --> 01:44:34,838
- What have they hit us with?
- Looks like some kind of gravity...

1051
01:44:35,095 --> 01:44:37,632
...weapon.
It's working in tandem with their ship.

1052
01:44:39,066 --> 01:44:42,138
Somehow they're increasing
the Earth's mass...

1053
01:44:42,402 --> 01:44:44,507
...clouding the atmosphere
with particulates.

1054
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:47,844
Oh, my God.

1055
01:44:49,176 --> 01:44:50,177
They're terraforming.

1056
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:51,752
What's that?

1057
01:44:52,579 --> 01:44:53,683
Planetary engineering...

1058
01:44:53,947 --> 01:44:57,156
...modifying the Earth's atmosphere
and topography.

1059
01:44:57,417 --> 01:44:58,657
Turning Earth into Krypton.

1060
01:44:59,353 --> 01:45:02,493
- But what happens to us?
- Based on these readings...

1061
01:45:02,756 --> 01:45:05,760
...there won't be an "us."
General Swanwick, sir.

1062
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:07,537
I'm on with the control tower.

1063
01:45:07,795 --> 01:45:10,036
Colonel Hardy's on his way
and he's got Superman in tow.

1064
01:45:10,764 --> 01:45:11,834
Superman?

1065
01:45:12,366 --> 01:45:13,538
The alien, sir.

1066
01:45:13,801 --> 01:45:16,179
That's what they're calling him.
Superman.

1067
01:45:21,675 --> 01:45:22,881
We have a plan, general.

1068
01:45:23,143 --> 01:45:24,622
Is that what I think it is?

1069
01:45:25,779 --> 01:45:27,554
It's the ship he arrived in.

1070
01:45:29,216 --> 01:45:31,856
This ship is powered by something
called a phantom drive.

1071
01:45:32,119 --> 01:45:33,564
It bends space.

1072
01:45:33,821 --> 01:45:37,792
Zod's ship uses the same technology, and
if we can make the two drives collide...

1073
01:45:38,025 --> 01:45:39,868
A singularity can be created.

1074
01:45:40,127 --> 01:45:41,567
- Like a black hole.
- Yes.

1075
01:45:41,695 --> 01:45:43,197
So if we open up this doorway...

1076
01:45:43,463 --> 01:45:45,067
...they should be pulled back in.

1077
01:45:45,332 --> 01:45:47,835
So you want us to bomb them with that?

1078
01:45:48,068 --> 01:45:50,048
General, that craft maxes out...

1079
01:45:50,304 --> 01:45:53,683
...17,000 pounds,
we can drop it from a C-17.

1080
01:45:53,907 --> 01:45:55,045
It's a viable plan.

1081
01:45:55,309 --> 01:45:57,414
If I don't stop that machine
over the Indian Ocean...

1082
01:45:57,678 --> 01:45:59,385
...the gravity field will continue...

1083
01:45:59,646 --> 01:46:00,989
...to expand.

1084
01:46:06,753 --> 01:46:09,529
If that thing is making Earth
more like Krypton...

1085
01:46:09,890 --> 01:46:11,426
...won't you be weaker around it?

1086
01:46:13,227 --> 01:46:14,535
Maybe.

1087
01:46:15,395 --> 01:46:17,875
I'm not about to let that
stop me from trying.

1088
01:46:18,832 --> 01:46:21,039
You might want to step back a little bit.

1089
01:46:23,103 --> 01:46:24,241
Maybe a little bit more.

1090
01:46:56,703 --> 01:46:57,306
Faora.

1091
01:46:58,305 --> 01:46:59,409
Take command.

1092
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:02,780
- Yes, sir.
- I need to secure the genesis chamber...

1093
01:47:03,210 --> 01:47:05,952
...and pay my respects to an old friend.

1094
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:15,825
Guardian en route to Metropolis...

1095
01:47:16,623 --> 01:47:17,829
...package in tow.

1096
01:47:23,096 --> 01:47:26,009
Be advised,
F-35s inbound to rendezvous point.

1097
01:47:26,266 --> 01:47:28,439
You should have visual contact now.

1098
01:48:13,447 --> 01:48:17,122
Command key accepted.
Genesis chamber coming online, sir.

1099
01:48:17,517 --> 01:48:18,517
Stop this, Zod...

1100
01:48:18,685 --> 01:48:20,824
...while there's still time.

1101
01:48:22,055 --> 01:48:25,366
Haven't given up lecturing me,
have you, even in death?

1102
01:48:25,726 --> 01:48:27,728
I will not let you use the Codex like this.

1103
01:48:27,995 --> 01:48:29,702
You don't have the power to stop me.

1104
01:48:29,963 --> 01:48:33,001
The command key I have entered
is revoking your authority.

1105
01:48:33,233 --> 01:48:36,146
This ship is now under my control.

1106
01:49:07,667 --> 01:49:09,347
Northcom, Lightning 1, request...

1107
01:49:09,503 --> 01:49:12,063
...permission to unleash the hounds.
Lightning 1...

1108
01:49:12,172 --> 01:49:15,619
...you are clear to engage. Send battle
damage assessment when able. Out.

1109
01:49:29,189 --> 01:49:31,567
Avionics are going haywire.
The gravity field...

1110
01:49:31,792 --> 01:49:34,136
...is pulling our missiles down.
We gotta get closer.

1111
01:49:39,232 --> 01:49:40,432
All right, everybody...

1112
01:49:40,534 --> 01:49:43,413
...we're leaving.
We're leaving the building now.

1113
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:08,437
I just lost my wingman.

1114
01:50:10,797 --> 01:50:11,935
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

1115
01:50:23,510 --> 01:50:25,490
Everybody, this way! Come on!

1116
01:50:25,745 --> 01:50:28,817
Everybody, come on!
Keep moving, keep moving.

1117
01:50:35,655 --> 01:50:36,690
Jenny!

1118
01:50:40,660 --> 01:50:41,502
Oh, my God.

1119
01:50:41,761 --> 01:50:42,762
Perry!

1120
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:49,146
Go! There! Go!

1121
01:50:55,008 --> 01:50:56,510
Our people can co-exist.

1122
01:50:57,144 --> 01:51:01,149
So we can suffer through years of pain
trying to adapt like your son has?

1123
01:51:01,982 --> 01:51:03,655
- You're talking about genocide.
- Yes.

1124
01:51:03,884 --> 01:51:06,490
And I'm arguing its merits with a ghost.

1125
01:51:07,854 --> 01:51:09,663
We're both ghosts, Zod.

1126
01:51:09,890 --> 01:51:13,394
Can't you see that?
The Krypton you're clinging onto is gone.

1127
01:51:13,660 --> 01:51:16,231
Ship, have you managed to quarantine
this invasive intelligence?

1128
01:51:16,496 --> 01:51:17,417
- You'll fail.
- I have.

1129
01:51:17,631 --> 01:51:19,042
Then prepare to terminate it.

1130
01:51:19,299 --> 01:51:21,074
- I'm tired of this debate.
Silencing me...

1131
01:51:21,334 --> 01:51:22,745
...won't change anything.

1132
01:51:25,005 --> 01:51:26,313
My son...

1133
01:51:27,140 --> 01:51:28,483
...is twice the man you were.

1134
01:51:31,478 --> 01:51:33,151
And he will finish what we started.

1135
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:35,320
I can promise you that.

1136
01:51:40,520 --> 01:51:41,897
Tell me...

1137
01:51:42,155 --> 01:51:45,728
...you have Jor-El's memories,
his conscience.

1138
01:51:46,426 --> 01:51:47,427
Can you experience...

1139
01:51:47,694 --> 01:51:48,832
...his pain?

1140
01:51:50,864 --> 01:51:54,437
I will harvest the Codex
from your son's corpse...

1141
01:51:54,901 --> 01:51:57,211
...and I will rebuild Krypton...

1142
01:51:57,437 --> 01:51:59,940
...atop his bones.

1143
01:52:28,268 --> 01:52:29,576
Argh!

1144
01:52:57,631 --> 01:52:58,336
Jenny.

1145
01:52:58,598 --> 01:53:01,340
- Jenny. Jenny, where are you?
- I'm here!

1146
01:53:01,601 --> 01:53:02,901
- I'm here. Here.
- Jenny.

1147
01:53:02,902 --> 01:53:04,404
Hold on, hold on.

1148
01:53:04,638 --> 01:53:05,616
I'm stuck.

1149
01:53:05,839 --> 01:53:07,512
- I can't get free. I'm stuck.
- Okay.

1150
01:53:07,774 --> 01:53:10,311
We'll get you out of there, all right?
Just sit tight.

1151
01:53:10,577 --> 01:53:11,146
No, no, no!

1152
01:53:11,411 --> 01:53:13,212
- Don't leave me.
- We're not gonna leave you.

1153
01:53:13,346 --> 01:53:14,518
- Okay.
- Lombard!

1154
01:53:14,781 --> 01:53:18,126
- Get your ass over here and help me.
- Damn it.

1155
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:22,100
- We just gotta move this.
- Here.

1156
01:53:22,322 --> 01:53:24,359
Slide that in. You push, I'll pull, okay?

1157
01:53:24,624 --> 01:53:25,659
Go.

1158
01:53:29,863 --> 01:53:31,171
- Push!
- Oh, my God.

1159
01:53:31,431 --> 01:53:33,265
It's getting closer!
Come on, push!

1160
01:53:35,101 --> 01:53:37,308
Northcom, this is Guardian.
Are we cleared?

1161
01:53:37,837 --> 01:53:38,838
Negative, Guardian.

1162
01:54:03,563 --> 01:54:06,009
Come on! Push!

1163
01:54:06,199 --> 01:54:07,200
Ahh!

1164
01:54:32,192 --> 01:54:34,172
Argh!

1165
01:54:58,017 --> 01:54:59,360
He did it.

1166
01:55:01,554 --> 01:55:02,794
Northcom, this is Guardian.

1167
01:55:03,056 --> 01:55:05,297
We're passing through phase line red.
Good to go.

1168
01:55:05,558 --> 01:55:06,725
Godspeed, Guardian.

1169
01:55:06,726 --> 01:55:09,138
Arm the package. You are cleared hot.

1170
01:55:09,396 --> 01:55:11,467
We're lining up for the final run.

1171
01:55:12,265 --> 01:55:14,267
It's up to you and Hamilton now.

1172
01:55:54,441 --> 01:55:55,441
You gotta be kidding me.

1173
01:55:55,442 --> 01:55:56,882
Loadmaster, is the package...

1174
01:55:57,110 --> 01:55:58,111
...ready to drop?

1175
01:55:58,344 --> 01:55:59,618
Negative, Guardian.

1176
01:55:59,846 --> 01:56:01,416
There's something wrong.
It's not supposed to do this.

1177
01:56:01,648 --> 01:56:03,423
What's it supposed to do?

1178
01:56:03,650 --> 01:56:06,688
- It's supposed to go in all the way.
- Let me take a look.

1179
01:56:06,953 --> 01:56:08,523
Co-pilot's aircraft.

1180
01:56:09,255 --> 01:56:10,757
Co-pilot's aircraft.

1181
01:56:17,497 --> 01:56:20,171
We are lined up for the drop.
What's the hold up?

1182
01:56:20,433 --> 01:56:21,434
We've had a setback.

1183
01:56:37,183 --> 01:56:38,685
Target that aircraft.

1184
01:56:42,555 --> 01:56:44,000
Target locked.

1185
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:54,676
Stop!

1186
01:56:54,901 --> 01:56:57,006
If you destroy this ship...

1187
01:56:57,237 --> 01:56:59,911
...you destroy Krypton!

1188
01:57:02,709 --> 01:57:04,882
Krypton had its chance.

1189
01:57:06,412 --> 01:57:08,187
Argh!

1190
01:57:58,865 --> 01:58:00,742
Miss Lane! It's not safe for you...

1191
01:58:00,967 --> 01:58:01,877
...over there!

1192
01:58:02,101 --> 01:58:02,704
Miss Lane!

1193
01:58:04,304 --> 01:58:05,544
Ah!

1194
01:58:32,599 --> 01:58:34,340
Move now! Go!

1195
01:58:55,188 --> 01:58:56,189
A good death...

1196
01:58:56,456 --> 01:58:58,026
...is its own reward.

1197
01:59:05,632 --> 01:59:07,009
Ah!

1198
01:59:28,554 --> 01:59:29,624
Ah!

1199
01:59:46,406 --> 01:59:47,817
Argh!

1200
02:00:00,486 --> 02:00:01,931
Are they gone?

1201
02:00:03,089 --> 02:00:04,500
I think so.

1202
02:00:06,392 --> 02:00:07,735
He saved us.

1203
02:00:33,219 --> 02:00:36,428
You know, they say it's all downhill
after the first kiss.

1204
02:00:39,892 --> 02:00:42,930
I'm pretty sure that only counts
when you're kissing a human.

1205
02:01:12,291 --> 02:01:13,770
Look at this.

1206
02:01:16,062 --> 02:01:17,973
We could have built a new Krypton...

1207
02:01:18,231 --> 02:01:19,972
...in this squalor.

1208
02:01:20,233 --> 02:01:23,339
But you chose the humans over us.

1209
02:01:24,771 --> 02:01:26,307
I exist...

1210
02:01:26,572 --> 02:01:28,984
...only to protect Krypton.

1211
02:01:30,743 --> 02:01:34,748
That is the sole purpose
for which I was born.

1212
02:01:35,982 --> 02:01:38,121
And every action I take...

1213
02:01:38,351 --> 02:01:40,353
...no matter how violent...

1214
02:01:40,620 --> 02:01:42,327
...or how cruel...

1215
02:01:43,523 --> 02:01:45,935
...is for the greater good...

1216
02:01:46,159 --> 02:01:48,105
...of my people.

1217
02:01:52,431 --> 02:01:53,842
And now...

1218
02:01:54,100 --> 02:01:56,376
...I have no people.

1219
02:01:59,806 --> 02:02:01,376
My soul...

1220
02:02:03,476 --> 02:02:07,014
...that is what you have taken...

1221
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:08,884
...from me.

1222
02:02:15,788 --> 02:02:18,291
I'm going to make them suffer, Kal.

1223
02:02:18,524 --> 02:02:21,971
These humans you've adopted,
I will take them all from you...

1224
02:02:22,195 --> 02:02:25,176
- ...one by one.
- You're a monster, Zod...

1225
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:29,006
...and I'm gonna stop you.

1226
02:02:41,480 --> 02:02:42,686
Argh!

1227
02:02:50,990 --> 02:02:51,661
Argh!

1228
02:04:10,603 --> 02:04:11,404
There's only...

1229
02:04:11,570 --> 02:04:12,913
...one way this ends, Kal.

1230
02:04:13,139 --> 02:04:14,982
Either you die...

1231
02:04:15,241 --> 02:04:16,015
...or I do.

1232
02:04:37,196 --> 02:04:38,106
Unh!

1233
02:04:47,673 --> 02:04:49,812
I was bred to be a warrior, Kal.

1234
02:04:50,676 --> 02:04:52,314
Trained my entire life...

1235
02:04:52,545 --> 02:04:54,388
...to master my senses.

1236
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:58,487
Where did you train? On a farm?

1237
02:06:50,262 --> 02:06:51,900
Argh!

1238
02:07:07,413 --> 02:07:08,858
If you love...

1239
02:07:09,115 --> 02:07:11,459
...these people so much...

1240
02:07:12,184 --> 02:07:14,460
...you can mourn for them.

1241
02:07:18,924 --> 02:07:19,994
Don't do this!

1242
02:07:23,195 --> 02:07:24,003
Stop!

1243
02:07:30,369 --> 02:07:31,347
Stop!

1244
02:07:33,706 --> 02:07:34,844
Never.

1245
02:08:04,837 --> 02:08:06,339
Ahh!

1246
02:09:09,535 --> 02:09:10,912
Are you effing stupid?

1247
02:09:11,136 --> 02:09:13,104
It's one of
your surveillance drones.

1248
02:09:13,105 --> 02:09:15,608
That's a $12,000,000
piece of hardware.

1249
02:09:15,774 --> 02:09:16,809
It was.

1250
02:09:17,610 --> 02:09:20,147
I know you're trying to find out
where I hang my cape.

1251
02:09:20,746 --> 02:09:22,225
- You won't.
- Then I'll ask...

1252
02:09:22,448 --> 02:09:23,756
...the obvious question:

1253
02:09:24,216 --> 02:09:27,220
How do we know you won't one day
act against America's interests?

1254
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:29,763
I grew up in Kansas, general.

1255
02:09:30,222 --> 02:09:32,395
I'm about as American as it gets.

1256
02:09:32,658 --> 02:09:33,568
Look...

1257
02:09:33,792 --> 02:09:35,271
...I'm here to help...

1258
02:09:35,494 --> 02:09:37,735
...but it has to be on my own terms.

1259
02:09:37,963 --> 02:09:39,806
You have to convince Washington of that.

1260
02:09:40,065 --> 02:09:44,070
Even if I were willing to try,
what makes you think they'd listen?

1261
02:09:45,137 --> 02:09:46,741
I don't know, general.

1262
02:09:48,140 --> 02:09:49,847
Guess I'll just have to trust you.

1263
02:09:59,418 --> 02:10:00,795
What are you smiling about?

1264
02:10:01,620 --> 02:10:02,963
Nothing, sir.

1265
02:10:06,125 --> 02:10:08,105
I just think he's kind of hot.

1266
02:10:10,262 --> 02:10:12,367
- Get in the car, captain.
- Mm-hm. Yes, sir.

1267
02:10:22,341 --> 02:10:25,550
He always believed
you were meant for greater things.

1268
02:10:25,811 --> 02:10:27,313
And that when the day came...

1269
02:10:27,546 --> 02:10:30,356
...your shoulders would be able
to bear the weight.

1270
02:10:30,616 --> 02:10:34,462
Yeah, I just wish he could have
been here to see it finally happen.

1271
02:10:34,887 --> 02:10:36,867
He saw it, Clark, believe me.

1272
02:11:24,370 --> 02:11:27,214
What are you going to do
when you're not saving the world?

1273
02:11:27,439 --> 02:11:31,182
- Have you given any thought to that?
- I have, actually. Heh, heh.

1274
02:11:32,778 --> 02:11:36,783
I gotta find a job
where I can keep my ear to the ground.

1275
02:11:42,020 --> 02:11:44,091
Where people won't look twice...

1276
02:11:44,356 --> 02:11:48,133
...when I want to go somewhere dangerous
and start asking questions...

1277
02:12:02,241 --> 02:12:05,279
Come on, Lois.
When are you gonna throw me a bone?

1278
02:12:06,545 --> 02:12:08,218
Courtside seats to the game tonight.

1279
02:12:08,647 --> 02:12:10,217
- What do you say?
- I say...

1280
02:12:10,449 --> 02:12:12,986
...you should go back
to trolling the intern pool.

1281
02:12:13,252 --> 02:12:16,631
You'll probably have more luck. Sorry.

1282
02:12:18,424 --> 02:12:19,095
Courtside?

1283
02:12:19,324 --> 02:12:21,065
- Don't. Ha, ha, ha.
- No.

1284
02:12:21,293 --> 02:12:24,103
Lombard, Lane,
I want you to meet our new stringer.

1285
02:12:24,329 --> 02:12:27,572
I want you to show him the ropes.
This is Clark Kent.

1286
02:12:27,800 --> 02:12:29,108
Good luck, kid.

1287
02:12:30,636 --> 02:12:31,910
Hey. Steve.

1288
02:12:32,137 --> 02:12:33,638
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

1289
02:12:33,639 --> 02:12:34,481
Hi.

1290
02:12:35,407 --> 02:12:36,750
Lois Lane.

1291
02:12:37,576 --> 02:12:39,112
Welcome to the Planet.

1292
02:12:42,848 --> 02:12:44,828
Glad to be here, Lois.
