1
00:01:00,404 --> 00:01:02,745
Police found her in the street.
Looks like she was bitten.

2
00:01:03,205 --> 00:01:04,241
Some kind of an animal.

3
00:01:04,586 --> 00:01:06,159
Jesus!
Her water's broken!

4
00:01:06,504 --> 00:01:08,117
She's going into
uterine contractions!

5
00:01:08,462 --> 00:01:10,380
We'll have to do
a C-section!

6
00:02:06,242 --> 00:02:07,317
What you got down there,
little man?

7
00:02:07,816 --> 00:02:08,967
Oh, that's
my heat seeker.

8
00:02:09,427 --> 00:02:10,962
I'll bet it is.

9
00:02:13,993 --> 00:02:14,990
So, where are we going?

10
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:16,602
It's a surprise,
baby.

11
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,328
Yeah, I like surprises.

12
00:02:18,712 --> 00:02:21,091
Yeah.

13
00:02:24,493 --> 00:02:26,155
Oh, my God!

14
00:02:26,578 --> 00:02:29,109
What the fuck
are we doing here?

15
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:33,062
Look at all that.

16
00:02:36,092 --> 00:02:37,857
What the fuck is that?

17
00:02:43,535 --> 00:02:44,072
Hey!

18
00:02:47,488 --> 00:02:49,367
What did you just say?

19
00:03:42,317 --> 00:03:43,273
Hey, what's up?

20
00:03:44,695 --> 00:03:45,691
Man!

21
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:57,047
All right.

22
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:04,835
Yeah.

23
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,446
What's happening?

24
00:04:30,426 --> 00:04:32,153
Man.

25
00:04:37,332 --> 00:04:38,292
Fuck.

26
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:50,954
Fuck. I need a drink.

27
00:05:36,264 --> 00:05:38,030
No! No!

28
00:05:42,902 --> 00:05:45,205
What's wrong, baby?

29
00:05:48,465 --> 00:05:50,231
No! No!

30
00:05:52,957 --> 00:05:53,415
No!

31
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:40,300
Is that him?

32
00:06:40,645 --> 00:06:41,949
Jesus, that's him.

33
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,057
It's Blade.
It's the daywalker.

34
00:07:05,507 --> 00:07:07,348
Come on, daywalker!

35
00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:29,103
Hey! I'm gonna rip
your fucking head off!

36
00:08:21,398 --> 00:08:23,815
That's him!
That's him! Get him!

37
00:08:24,313 --> 00:08:25,081
Fuck him up!

38
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,189
We're gonna jack you up.
Make him hurt bad.

39
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:33,797
Quinn...

40
00:09:34,219 --> 00:09:37,288
I'm getting a little tired
of chopping you up.

41
00:09:41,585 --> 00:09:44,884
Thought I might try fire
for a change.

42
00:09:47,877 --> 00:09:49,604
Give my regards to Frost.

43
00:09:52,827 --> 00:09:55,014
No! Please don't!

44
00:10:08,902 --> 00:10:09,900
Put him out.

45
00:10:10,437 --> 00:10:12,355
Yes, sir.
Paramedics.

46
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,256
Got a charred cadaver here
for you. Still warm too.

47
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:39,251
1, 2, 3.

48
00:10:44,047 --> 00:10:46,311
Oh, Jesus, that's rank.

49
00:10:46,694 --> 00:10:48,689
Paramedics said
he was still screaming

50
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:52,411
when they found him
stapled to a wall.

51
00:10:52,795 --> 00:10:54,598
That's very pretty.

52
00:11:07,221 --> 00:11:08,180
Did you check
the chem count?

53
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:10,175
His blood sugar's
3 times norm,

54
00:11:10,558 --> 00:11:11,902
phosphorus and uric acid
are off the charts.

55
00:11:12,362 --> 00:11:15,354
You took this
off a D.O.A.?

56
00:11:15,815 --> 00:11:17,541
Yeah.

57
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,652
But this doesn't
make any sense.

58
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:24,063
The red blood cells
are biconvex,

59
00:11:24,447 --> 00:11:25,484
which is impossible.

60
00:11:26,021 --> 00:11:29,128
Look at the polys.
They're binucleated.

61
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,922
OK, Curtis, it's 3.00
in the morning...

62
00:11:35,382 --> 00:11:36,341
This is not a joke.

63
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:39,795
I've got the body sitting
in the morgue right now.

64
00:11:40,217 --> 00:11:42,480
I thought you promised
to give me some distance.

65
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:45,511
I just want you to come down
and take a look.

66
00:11:51,804 --> 00:11:54,988
OK. Show me the body.

67
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,521
And I don't want to hear
a word about us.

68
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:00,436
Done. We've had
that conversation.

69
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,999
You haven't started on
the internal organs yet?

70
00:12:06,421 --> 00:12:09,068
Just a blood sample
through the pericardium.

71
00:12:10,757 --> 00:12:13,711
The maxilla looks
a little deformed.

72
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:16,358
There's some odd muscle
structure around the canines.

73
00:12:16,818 --> 00:12:17,778
I'm going
to start the "Y"

74
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,543
and check
the tracheal mucosa.

75
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:27,178
Let me ask you
something.

76
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,173
Honestly...

77
00:12:29,556 --> 00:12:30,862
you ever have second
thoughts about us?

78
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:35,772
Sometimes.

79
00:12:37,768 --> 00:12:39,571
But then I remember how much
of an asshole you were.

80
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:41,067
Want to cut me
some slack here?

81
00:12:41,489 --> 00:12:43,830
You asked for some time off,
I gave you some time off.

82
00:12:44,252 --> 00:12:44,827
Look, Curtis...

83
00:12:45,249 --> 00:12:46,323
I'm trying.

84
00:12:46,784 --> 00:12:47,666
It's over.

85
00:13:06,504 --> 00:13:08,384
Call security!

86
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:24,652
Came back
to finish you off.

87
00:13:25,113 --> 00:13:27,107
Get out of my way,
you freak!

88
00:13:33,745 --> 00:13:35,318
Freeze!

89
00:13:36,968 --> 00:13:40,037
Motherfucker, are you
out of your damn mind?!

90
00:14:30,491 --> 00:14:31,450
Hey, you! Freeze!

91
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:49,828
Freeze!

92
00:14:50,326 --> 00:14:52,129
Hold it right there!

93
00:15:06,747 --> 00:15:07,783
My shoulder.

94
00:15:08,896 --> 00:15:10,316
It's dislocated.

95
00:16:55,288 --> 00:16:56,286
Whistler.

96
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:01,197
Whistler.

97
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,717
Bringing home
strays now?

98
00:17:11,057 --> 00:17:12,208
She's been bitten.

99
00:17:16,505 --> 00:17:17,771
Should've
killed her then.

100
00:17:18,193 --> 00:17:19,729
Yeah, I know.

101
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:23,526
But I didn't.

102
00:17:30,126 --> 00:17:31,967
You watch her close.

103
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:35,114
If she starts to turn,
you finish her off.

104
00:17:38,643 --> 00:17:40,447
Or I will.

105
00:17:47,391 --> 00:17:49,002
She's borderline.

106
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:54,259
Another hour, she'd be
well into the change.

107
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:56,983
Dr. Karen Jenson,

108
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,093
listen close.

109
00:17:59,554 --> 00:18:01,357
I'm going to inject you
with Allium sativum.

110
00:18:01,817 --> 00:18:03,275
Garlic.

111
00:18:03,658 --> 00:18:05,501
This is going
to hurt a lot.

112
00:18:05,923 --> 00:18:07,611
It was Quinn.

113
00:18:08,148 --> 00:18:09,989
Frost's little
errand boy?

114
00:18:10,449 --> 00:18:12,023
You get
a lead on him?

115
00:18:12,484 --> 00:18:13,021
No.

116
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:16,013
Too bad.

117
00:18:18,546 --> 00:18:19,581
Hold her.

118
00:18:30,017 --> 00:18:31,936
I give her fifty-fifty

119
00:18:32,358 --> 00:18:35,734
if she makes it
through the night.

120
00:18:59,867 --> 00:19:01,325
Blade...

121
00:19:01,747 --> 00:19:03,319
the daywalker...

122
00:19:03,741 --> 00:19:06,620
still pursuing
his ridiculous crusade.

123
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,377
How many died?

124
00:19:11,876 --> 00:19:13,832
We don't have
an exact count.

125
00:19:14,293 --> 00:19:15,981
Apparently, he used
a lot of silver.

126
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:17,631
We're having
difficulty...

127
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,396
Send in Frost.

128
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,872
Deacon Frost.

129
00:19:32,748 --> 00:19:35,126
You can come in now.

130
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:08,505
These nightclubs of yours
are dangerous.

131
00:20:09,081 --> 00:20:10,424
Are they?

132
00:20:10,962 --> 00:20:13,302
They draw needless
attention to our kind.

133
00:20:13,724 --> 00:20:14,491
You know our policy.

134
00:20:14,836 --> 00:20:16,525
Your policy,
not mine.

135
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,596
Our livelihood...

136
00:20:19,095 --> 00:20:23,776
depends on our ability
to blend in

137
00:20:24,198 --> 00:20:26,116
and our discretion.

138
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,762
Maybe it's time we forgot
about discretion.

139
00:20:30,222 --> 00:20:31,526
We should be ruling
the humans,

140
00:20:31,987 --> 00:20:32,600
not running around

141
00:20:33,176 --> 00:20:34,327
making back-alley treaties
with them.

142
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,744
For fuck's sake,
these people are our food,

143
00:20:37,243 --> 00:20:37,742
not our allies.

144
00:20:38,164 --> 00:20:39,200
You're out of line, Frost.

145
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,964
Am I?

146
00:20:41,348 --> 00:20:42,768
Or maybe I'm just
the first to say out loud

147
00:20:43,267 --> 00:20:44,264
what we've
all been thinking.

148
00:20:44,686 --> 00:20:46,106
We have existed this way

149
00:20:46,528 --> 00:20:48,753
for thousands of years.

150
00:20:49,176 --> 00:20:49,751
Who are you

151
00:20:50,211 --> 00:20:53,472
to challenge our ways?

152
00:20:53,856 --> 00:20:56,005
You're not even
a pureblood.

153
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:00,532
Like it matters.

154
00:21:01,721 --> 00:21:05,021
I was born a vampire,

155
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:08,473
as was every other member
of this house,

156
00:21:08,973 --> 00:21:10,201
but you, Frost...

157
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:16,071
you were merely turned.

158
00:21:18,219 --> 00:21:19,600
The world belongs to us,

159
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,902
not the humans.

160
00:21:22,325 --> 00:21:23,629
You know that.

161
00:21:28,156 --> 00:21:30,420
Do we have any other
business to discuss?

162
00:21:30,842 --> 00:21:32,837
Well...

163
00:21:33,412 --> 00:21:34,870
there's the matter of
our offshore accounts.

164
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:35,983
We're having
difficulty...

165
00:21:36,405 --> 00:21:37,249
And have you made
the transfer to the...

166
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:38,669
Gitano...

167
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:42,659
you may wake up one day
and find yourself extinct.

168
00:22:14,619 --> 00:22:15,578
You're a week early.

169
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:17,381
Yeah.

170
00:22:24,518 --> 00:22:26,973
Whistler says I'm building up
a resistance to the serum.

171
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:32,536
Yeah, I figured
that might happen.

172
00:22:41,131 --> 00:22:43,701
You take care, all right?

173
00:24:23,341 --> 00:24:25,566
I must be getting
soft in my old age,

174
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:28,828
letting you bring home
a stray like that.

175
00:24:29,326 --> 00:24:31,359
It was damn stupid of you.

176
00:24:31,781 --> 00:24:33,700
Might've lucked out,
though.

177
00:24:35,005 --> 00:24:37,345
I checked her background.

178
00:24:39,801 --> 00:24:42,755
It turns out
she's a haematologist.

179
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:46,630
She might be useful to us.

180
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:48,433
I doubt it.

181
00:24:50,044 --> 00:24:51,387
I'm serious.

182
00:24:51,886 --> 00:24:53,268
I took a look
at that notebook of hers.

183
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,800
She's onto something.

184
00:24:57,718 --> 00:24:59,790
I had to increase
the dose.

185
00:25:01,248 --> 00:25:02,859
It's over
50 milligrams now.

186
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:04,240
That's getting
dangerous.

187
00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:05,737
Just do it,

188
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,847
old man.

189
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,892
Wander off
the beaten path, Doctor?

190
00:26:09,848 --> 00:26:11,077
Who are you people?

191
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,534
My name's
Abraham Whistler.

192
00:26:14,261 --> 00:26:15,527
You've met Blade.

193
00:26:31,066 --> 00:26:32,485
So, am I
a prisoner here?

194
00:26:34,442 --> 00:26:35,976
Not at all.

195
00:26:36,437 --> 00:26:37,550
We just had to take
certain precautions

196
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:39,890
before we let you go.

197
00:26:40,389 --> 00:26:41,770
You got to understand,

198
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,151
they're everywhere.

199
00:26:43,534 --> 00:26:45,300
Vampires...

200
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,141
the Hominus nocturna.

201
00:26:48,484 --> 00:26:49,635
We hunt them, you see...

202
00:26:50,095 --> 00:26:51,631
moving from one city
to the next

203
00:26:52,129 --> 00:26:53,280
tracking
their migrations.

204
00:26:53,664 --> 00:26:54,776
They're hard to kill.

205
00:26:55,237 --> 00:26:56,579
They tend to regenerate.

206
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,076
And I'm supposed
to believe all this?

207
00:26:58,498 --> 00:27:01,375
Well, you already met
Mr. Crispy at the hospital.

208
00:27:01,874 --> 00:27:03,140
What do you think?

209
00:27:05,098 --> 00:27:06,594
So, what do you use, then?

210
00:27:07,016 --> 00:27:08,588
Stakes? Crosses?

211
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:10,507
Crosses don't do squat.

212
00:27:10,968 --> 00:27:13,500
Some of the legends
are true, though.

213
00:27:13,922 --> 00:27:16,570
Vampires are severely
allergic to silver.

214
00:27:17,107 --> 00:27:18,564
Feed them garlic,

215
00:27:19,025 --> 00:27:20,060
and they go into
anaphylactic shock.

216
00:27:20,521 --> 00:27:21,940
Then, of course,
there's always sunlight,

217
00:27:22,401 --> 00:27:23,782
ultraviolet rays.

218
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:26,775
I got this sucker
running.

219
00:27:27,273 --> 00:27:29,230
You want to give it
a try tonight?

220
00:27:35,062 --> 00:27:36,099
It's still heavy.

221
00:27:37,633 --> 00:27:38,784
Well, you're so big.

222
00:27:41,162 --> 00:27:42,313
If you want to live
to see another day,

223
00:27:42,698 --> 00:27:44,155
you'll be out of town
by nightfall.

224
00:27:44,577 --> 00:27:46,495
So where am I
supposed to go?

225
00:27:49,796 --> 00:27:52,212
You've been exposed to them.

226
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:55,858
One way or another, somebody's
going to take you out.

227
00:28:00,231 --> 00:28:02,955
There's a war going on
out there.

228
00:28:03,377 --> 00:28:05,718
Blade, myself,
a few others,

229
00:28:06,216 --> 00:28:07,099
we've tried to keep it
from spilling over

230
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:08,134
onto the streets.

231
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:10,590
Sometimes,
people like yourself

232
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:13,352
get caught
in the crossfire.

233
00:28:13,851 --> 00:28:15,770
I have blood samples.
I can go to the police.

234
00:28:16,269 --> 00:28:18,609
They own the police.

235
00:28:19,069 --> 00:28:20,412
You have to understand,
they're everywhere.

236
00:28:20,757 --> 00:28:22,484
Chances are you've
seen them yourself

237
00:28:22,983 --> 00:28:23,520
and didn't know it.

238
00:28:23,981 --> 00:28:25,745
On the subway
or in a bar.

239
00:28:27,817 --> 00:28:30,119
So that's it?

240
00:28:30,503 --> 00:28:33,418
You guys just patch me up
and send me on my way?

241
00:28:37,447 --> 00:28:38,637
Here.

242
00:28:39,174 --> 00:28:40,440
Vampire mace...

243
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,471
silver nitrate,
essence of garlic.

244
00:28:44,008 --> 00:28:46,118
You keep your eyes open.

245
00:28:46,463 --> 00:28:48,344
Be careful.

246
00:28:52,372 --> 00:28:53,638
One other thing...

247
00:28:54,828 --> 00:28:57,015
buy yourself a gun.

248
00:28:57,437 --> 00:29:00,889
If you start getting
sensitive to daylight...

249
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:03,000
if you find
you're thirsty

250
00:29:03,422 --> 00:29:06,107
regardless of how much
you had to drink,

251
00:29:06,568 --> 00:29:07,603
then I suggest
you take that gun

252
00:29:08,026 --> 00:29:10,520
and use it on yourself.

253
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,546
Better that
than the alternative.

254
00:30:11,063 --> 00:30:12,713
You have been warned
before.

255
00:30:13,173 --> 00:30:14,171
These archives
are restricted

256
00:30:14,555 --> 00:30:17,509
to members of the House of Erebus.

257
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:21,078
You are wasting your time.

258
00:30:21,538 --> 00:30:23,149
It's a dead language.

259
00:30:23,533 --> 00:30:27,178
The ancient texts
can never be translated.

260
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,324
You wouldn't even
understand them.

261
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,278
Damn it, Frost!

262
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,775
I'm talking to you!

263
00:30:38,726 --> 00:30:41,028
Keep your voice down,
Gitano.

264
00:30:43,062 --> 00:30:44,136
We're in a library.

265
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:45,478
You don't need
to shout.

266
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:49,738
What are you up to,
Frost?

267
00:30:59,905 --> 00:31:02,936
What are you
going to do, hmm?

268
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,231
What?

269
00:31:13,602 --> 00:31:15,060
You bore me.

270
00:31:42,339 --> 00:31:44,065
Hey!

271
00:31:48,631 --> 00:31:51,010
Remember
what we told you.

272
00:31:51,432 --> 00:31:53,236
You keep your eyes open.

273
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:54,271
They're everywhere.

274
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:57,916
But it's daytime!

275
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,503
How you doing?

276
00:34:11,895 --> 00:34:13,468
Hi there. Hey.

277
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:14,542
I'm sorry.

278
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,383
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

279
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:17,381
Police officer.

280
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:18,609
I'm sorry, OK?

281
00:34:19,069 --> 00:34:20,143
Police officer. I didn't
mean to scare you.

282
00:34:20,565 --> 00:34:21,141
The front door was open.

283
00:34:21,486 --> 00:34:22,253
What are you doing in here?

284
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:25,362
I'm just here
on a routine check.

285
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,896
Look, I'm...
I'm Officer Krieger,

286
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:28,277
42nd precinct.

287
00:34:28,776 --> 00:34:31,155
You're Karen Jenson,
right?

288
00:34:31,615 --> 00:34:32,958
Yeah.

289
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,531
Your co-workers
at the hospital

290
00:34:34,768 --> 00:34:38,061
said that you were
kidnapped last night.

291
00:34:38,483 --> 00:34:39,481
Are you OK?

292
00:34:39,864 --> 00:34:42,857
What happened to
the other doctor I was with?

293
00:34:44,545 --> 00:34:45,274
Curtis Webb?

294
00:34:45,773 --> 00:34:47,192
He died.

295
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:49,225
No, look,

296
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:50,646
don't worry about that
right now, OK?

297
00:34:51,106 --> 00:34:52,602
Why?

298
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:56,247
Because you're dead
too, you bitch.

299
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,429
Bitch!
What is it?

300
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:04,535
What is this, garlic?

301
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:07,220
Yeah. He said it would
work against vampires.

302
00:35:07,565 --> 00:35:09,024
Vampires?

303
00:35:10,136 --> 00:35:12,208
Who said I was
a vampire, huh?

304
00:35:14,241 --> 00:35:15,469
Nobody.

305
00:35:20,265 --> 00:35:22,337
He's a familiar.

306
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:24,332
A vampire wannabe.

307
00:35:24,754 --> 00:35:27,401
If he's loyal enough

308
00:35:27,861 --> 00:35:32,235
and he proves himself, maybe
his master will turn him.

309
00:35:32,619 --> 00:35:34,499
Wait a minute.
You used me as bait?

310
00:35:34,998 --> 00:35:36,610
Get over it.

311
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:42,096
Is all that necessary?

312
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,696
That's a glyph...

313
00:35:49,194 --> 00:35:50,268
a vampire cattle brand.

314
00:35:50,614 --> 00:35:53,107
It means that Officer Krieger
is somebody's property.

315
00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:55,141
Another vampire tries
to bleed this little hooker,

316
00:35:55,563 --> 00:35:57,865
then they have to answer
to his owner.

317
00:35:59,706 --> 00:36:01,433
Deacon Frost.

318
00:36:01,932 --> 00:36:03,774
We've been tracking him
for a long time.

319
00:36:04,234 --> 00:36:05,577
All right.

320
00:36:06,037 --> 00:36:07,264
Officer Krieger,

321
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:10,027
you going to be a good
little bloodhound, huh?

322
00:36:10,449 --> 00:36:11,830
Tell us what your master's
been up to.

323
00:36:12,252 --> 00:36:12,943
Oh, great,
now you're robbing him.

324
00:36:13,442 --> 00:36:14,362
You going
to rob me too?

325
00:36:14,862 --> 00:36:17,432
How do you think that we
fund this organization, huh?

326
00:36:17,854 --> 00:36:21,193
We're not exactly
the March of Dimes.

327
00:36:23,034 --> 00:36:24,300
It's fake.

328
00:36:27,177 --> 00:36:28,214
Well...

329
00:36:28,636 --> 00:36:31,244
Looks like our friend here
has been blood running, huh?

330
00:36:31,551 --> 00:36:32,740
Hillbarn Clinic.

331
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:34,237
I know this place.
It's a blood bank.

332
00:36:34,544 --> 00:36:35,465
Owned by vampires,

333
00:36:35,849 --> 00:36:36,884
and there's one
in every city.

334
00:36:37,306 --> 00:36:38,342
And they always deliver.

335
00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:40,107
So, where were you
taking it?

336
00:36:40,452 --> 00:36:41,719
I don't know what
you're talking...

337
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,865
Look, take it easy.

338
00:36:45,363 --> 00:36:47,013
I'm only going to ask you
one more time.

339
00:36:47,474 --> 00:36:49,584
Where were you taking it?

340
00:36:50,121 --> 00:36:51,349
Go fuck yourself.

341
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,152
Fuck me?
No, you fuck this.

342
00:37:09,995 --> 00:37:11,645
You better wake up.

343
00:37:12,067 --> 00:37:14,753
The world you live in is
just a sugarcoated topping.

344
00:37:15,252 --> 00:37:17,208
There is another world
beneath it.

345
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,321
The real world.

346
00:37:18,781 --> 00:37:19,548
And if you want
to survive it,

347
00:37:20,085 --> 00:37:22,810
you better learn
to pull the trigger.

348
00:37:25,764 --> 00:37:27,299
Wait a minute.

349
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,335
I'm coming with you.

350
00:37:28,795 --> 00:37:29,754
You're useless.

351
00:37:33,245 --> 00:37:35,433
I have to stick with you.

352
00:37:35,893 --> 00:37:37,581
It's the only way that
I'll stay alive long enough

353
00:37:38,195 --> 00:37:39,614
to find a cure for myself.

354
00:37:40,229 --> 00:37:42,032
There is no cure.

355
00:37:50,281 --> 00:37:52,851
He's not going
to come back.

356
00:37:54,118 --> 00:37:55,499
Nobody's that stupid.

357
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:58,645
When you understand
the nature of a thing,

358
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:00,717
you know what
it's capable of.

359
00:38:18,135 --> 00:38:18,557
It's Krieger.

360
00:38:19,094 --> 00:38:19,978
I'm at 16-0-0-9.

361
00:38:20,361 --> 00:38:21,052
Yes?

362
00:38:21,512 --> 00:38:22,509
Get me through.

363
00:38:26,193 --> 00:38:28,188
I got a delivery
in progress here,

364
00:38:28,571 --> 00:38:29,799
and I just had a run-in
with Blade.

365
00:38:36,053 --> 00:38:38,546
I got to clear out
that clinic on Hillbarn now!

366
00:38:58,459 --> 00:39:00,570
Looks like
we hit pay dirt.

367
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,450
That's a vampire mark.

368
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:03,600
It means that
there's a safe house

369
00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:05,212
around here somewhere...

370
00:39:05,558 --> 00:39:08,090
a place they can go
with donors coming.

371
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,315
See the valets
over there?

372
00:39:10,698 --> 00:39:11,850
They're vampires.

373
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:14,267
So is the doorman

374
00:39:14,612 --> 00:39:17,182
and the whore
on the corner.

375
00:39:17,604 --> 00:39:18,795
How can you tell?

376
00:39:19,332 --> 00:39:21,058
By the way they move...

377
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:22,324
the way they smell.

378
00:39:26,736 --> 00:39:28,271
It's like a bad dream.

379
00:39:28,693 --> 00:39:30,611
There are worse things
out tonight than vampires.

380
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:31,839
Like what?

381
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,604
Like me.

382
00:39:35,254 --> 00:39:36,980
OK, Vampire Anatomy 101.

383
00:39:37,402 --> 00:39:38,630
Crosses and holy water
don't do dick,

384
00:39:39,091 --> 00:39:40,548
so forget what you've seen
in the movies.

385
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:42,812
You use a stake, silver,
or sunlight.

386
00:39:43,195 --> 00:39:44,654
You know how to use
one of these?

387
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:45,843
Nope...

388
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,608
but I'll damn sure
learn quick.

389
00:39:48,107 --> 00:39:49,181
The safety's off,
rounds already chambered...

390
00:39:49,603 --> 00:39:50,485
silver hollow point
filled with garlic.

391
00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:52,097
You aim for the head
or the heart.

392
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:54,015
Anything else is your ass.

393
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,776
Do you have an invitation?

394
00:40:44,967 --> 00:40:46,233
Kenji!

395
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,117
Where's the entrance?

396
00:41:02,577 --> 00:41:03,268
I can't tell you
that, man.

397
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:08,793
I'm going to ask you
one more time.

398
00:41:09,215 --> 00:41:10,597
Where's the entrance?

399
00:41:11,057 --> 00:41:12,860
OK. OK.

400
00:41:13,857 --> 00:41:15,814
It's in the freezer.

401
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:25,866
Come on, man!
I told you!

402
00:41:26,365 --> 00:41:28,283
It's in the fridge!

403
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:37,108
OK.

404
00:41:37,607 --> 00:41:39,295
You give Frost
a message from me.

405
00:41:39,755 --> 00:41:41,750
You tell him it's
open season on suckheads.

406
00:42:22,881 --> 00:42:25,374
Some kind of archive.

407
00:42:29,134 --> 00:42:31,244
This must be where they keep
most of their records.

408
00:42:31,628 --> 00:42:33,354
Isn't this just
a little high-tech?

409
00:42:33,776 --> 00:42:35,657
They've got their claws
into everything...

410
00:42:36,232 --> 00:42:37,652
politics, finance,
real estate.

411
00:42:38,074 --> 00:42:41,027
They already own
half of downtown.

412
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:04,892
Frost throws a good party.

413
00:43:05,353 --> 00:43:06,350
Yeah...

414
00:43:06,887 --> 00:43:08,461
but where is he?

415
00:43:21,851 --> 00:43:23,040
Come on, baby.

416
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:34,666
Don't keep everyone
waiting.

417
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,080
Deacon,

418
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:57,187
there's someone here
to see you.

419
00:43:59,565 --> 00:44:02,175
I got to talk to you,
Frost.

420
00:44:02,558 --> 00:44:04,246
I'm sorry.
I had to come here.

421
00:44:04,707 --> 00:44:06,280
It's a mistake
going to Pearl's.

422
00:44:06,663 --> 00:44:08,774
I know that.
Dumb fucking me.

423
00:44:09,196 --> 00:44:10,002
I know you're
disappointed.

424
00:44:10,424 --> 00:44:11,037
Am I that
transparent?

425
00:44:11,421 --> 00:44:12,073
You want
to meet him?

426
00:44:12,418 --> 00:44:13,070
Yeah.

427
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:14,261
I can get you guys
in with him,

428
00:44:14,644 --> 00:44:15,910
because we're tight.
We're like brothers.

429
00:44:16,332 --> 00:44:17,330
Fuck.

430
00:44:17,828 --> 00:44:18,519
Fuck.

431
00:44:19,018 --> 00:44:19,977
- Hey.
- Yeah.

432
00:44:20,975 --> 00:44:22,394
Deac. Deac.

433
00:44:22,816 --> 00:44:24,543
I've been telling these
bitches all about you, man.

434
00:44:24,965 --> 00:44:25,732
They've been dying
to meet you.

435
00:44:26,192 --> 00:44:26,729
They are so psyched.

436
00:44:27,229 --> 00:44:28,226
Bad ass bitches.
They...

437
00:44:28,648 --> 00:44:29,531
Hi.

438
00:44:30,029 --> 00:44:30,528
Deac?

439
00:44:31,027 --> 00:44:33,137
Frost, it's about Blade.

440
00:44:33,598 --> 00:44:34,480
He's busy, you know?

441
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,245
Because, like, when
he's focused on business...

442
00:44:36,705 --> 00:44:39,084
Look, Frost,
this is important.

443
00:44:39,544 --> 00:44:41,003
Blade was waiting for me,

444
00:44:41,463 --> 00:44:43,343
using the girl as bait.

445
00:44:43,803 --> 00:44:45,222
And you were stupid
enough to take it.

446
00:44:45,568 --> 00:44:46,373
Shut up, bitch.

447
00:44:46,758 --> 00:44:47,755
I didn't know he was
going to be there.

448
00:44:48,254 --> 00:44:49,213
It was a trap, see?

449
00:44:49,635 --> 00:44:50,479
But don't worry
about it.

450
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:52,474
It's no problem. We can
still get the girl.

451
00:44:53,971 --> 00:44:55,237
Yeah!

452
00:45:22,861 --> 00:45:23,858
Forget the girl.

453
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:25,239
I want Blade.

454
00:45:25,623 --> 00:45:27,082
I know you do.

455
00:45:27,504 --> 00:45:28,079
You hear me, Quinn?

456
00:45:28,463 --> 00:45:30,304
I want him alive.

457
00:45:30,764 --> 00:45:31,723
What?

458
00:45:34,371 --> 00:45:35,254
Wait a minute, man.

459
00:45:35,676 --> 00:45:37,440
You want him alive?

460
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:41,776
What's that smell?

461
00:45:44,615 --> 00:45:46,380
...image carefully, Frost.

462
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:51,636
You will need 12 purebloods
to make the ritual work.

463
00:45:52,096 --> 00:45:53,593
Krieger, is that you?

464
00:45:54,015 --> 00:45:54,744
He's here!

465
00:45:55,243 --> 00:45:55,742
He's here!

466
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,468
This must be Pearl,

467
00:45:57,928 --> 00:45:58,465
the record keeper.

468
00:46:00,653 --> 00:46:02,341
He's going to kill me!

469
00:46:02,763 --> 00:46:04,719
You need me, Frost!
You need me!

470
00:46:05,218 --> 00:46:06,408
Pearl, you're history.

471
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:08,786
Have the good grace to die
with some fuckin' dignity.

472
00:46:09,285 --> 00:46:10,513
Frost.

473
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:12,432
Ruthless bloodsucker.

474
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:13,621
Congratulations, Blade.

475
00:46:14,158 --> 00:46:15,194
Frost.

476
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:16,690
I hear you've
been lookin' for me.

477
00:46:17,189 --> 00:46:17,726
I'm flattered.

478
00:46:18,186 --> 00:46:19,530
It'll pass.

479
00:46:21,908 --> 00:46:22,445
Fuck.

480
00:46:25,285 --> 00:46:25,899
What is that?

481
00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:28,354
That, biscuit boy,
is a UV lamp.

482
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:29,390
We're gonna play

483
00:46:29,888 --> 00:46:31,154
a little game
of 20 questions.

484
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:32,766
Depending on
how you answer,

485
00:46:33,265 --> 00:46:35,682
you may walk out
of here with a tan.

486
00:46:36,104 --> 00:46:36,948
What's that?

487
00:46:37,408 --> 00:46:38,713
Oh, that?
Oh, it's nothing.

488
00:46:39,212 --> 00:46:40,493
It's routine research.

489
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,626
Actually,
it's a video game.

490
00:46:53,484 --> 00:46:54,635
That must've hurt.

491
00:46:55,172 --> 00:46:56,592
It's a fragment,
a piece of the prophecy!

492
00:46:57,129 --> 00:46:57,897
What prophecy?

493
00:46:58,319 --> 00:46:59,777
Oh, I'm not really sure.

494
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:01,810
There are so many out...

495
00:47:15,353 --> 00:47:18,769
And there is nothing you
can do about it, daywalker!

496
00:47:19,229 --> 00:47:20,610
Is that so?

497
00:47:21,032 --> 00:47:23,602
Well, that's
what Frost says.

498
00:47:24,024 --> 00:47:25,253
Then you won't mind me

499
00:47:25,636 --> 00:47:28,053
borrowing this
for a while, will you?

500
00:47:28,475 --> 00:47:29,933
If he moves, fry him.

501
00:47:33,156 --> 00:47:33,693
What's in here?

502
00:47:34,192 --> 00:47:34,921
Nothing.
It's a storeroom.

503
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,417
But you're
wasting your time.

504
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:38,413
There's nothing
of importance to anyone.

505
00:47:38,835 --> 00:47:40,331
Then you won't mind
if I take a peek.

506
00:47:40,753 --> 00:47:41,788
No!

507
00:48:03,543 --> 00:48:04,809
He moved.

508
00:48:34,352 --> 00:48:36,462
What is this?

509
00:48:37,997 --> 00:48:38,841
These are the pages

510
00:48:39,301 --> 00:48:41,143
from The Book of Erebus,

511
00:48:41,526 --> 00:48:42,870
the Vampire Bible.

512
00:48:45,056 --> 00:48:47,665
It contains everything.

513
00:48:48,164 --> 00:48:49,507
Their entire history.

514
00:48:50,697 --> 00:48:54,149
La Magra must be
one of their legends.

515
00:48:56,605 --> 00:48:58,715
Why is Frost
so interested in La Magra?

516
00:49:36,162 --> 00:49:37,543
Give me your hand.

517
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:43,145
Do you remember me?

518
00:50:00,563 --> 00:50:01,983
Give it to him!

519
00:50:17,253 --> 00:50:18,135
Hey! Hey!

520
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,245
Nice one.

521
00:50:21,589 --> 00:50:22,279
Well, well, well.

522
00:50:22,701 --> 00:50:24,427
You took my arm, man.

523
00:50:24,926 --> 00:50:26,346
Remember?

524
00:50:26,806 --> 00:50:28,149
But it's cool.

525
00:50:28,533 --> 00:50:30,528
I got a new one.

526
00:50:32,139 --> 00:50:33,750
Think I'll ever
play piano again?

527
00:50:35,708 --> 00:50:37,281
You can slice him,
you can dice him,

528
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:39,275
but the Quinn man
just keeps on comin'!

529
00:50:39,697 --> 00:50:40,388
Check it out.

530
00:50:40,848 --> 00:50:42,537
I've got his pigsticker.

531
00:50:45,874 --> 00:50:48,177
You're a fuck up, Crease!

532
00:50:49,712 --> 00:50:50,479
You're a fuck up!

533
00:50:50,862 --> 00:50:52,052
I got his pigsticker!

534
00:50:53,624 --> 00:50:55,544
You're just
full of surprises,

535
00:50:56,081 --> 00:50:57,308
isn't you, chief?

536
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:07,168
Stay with me, sweetness...

537
00:51:07,514 --> 00:51:10,315
'cause I'm not finished
with you yet.

538
00:51:12,463 --> 00:51:14,229
Looky here.

539
00:51:16,185 --> 00:51:17,643
Silver.

540
00:51:18,103 --> 00:51:19,254
Nice craftsmanship, huh?

541
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:21,288
Probably cost you
a pretty penny.

542
00:51:21,672 --> 00:51:25,661
Now, this here is a man
who takes his job...

543
00:51:27,005 --> 00:51:29,882
just a little too seriously,
don't you think?

544
00:51:33,988 --> 00:51:36,213
Come to think of it, Blade,

545
00:51:36,596 --> 00:51:38,284
I owe you one.

546
00:51:42,428 --> 00:51:44,883
Actually, if you want
to get technical, Blade...

547
00:51:46,495 --> 00:51:47,800
I owe you two.

548
00:51:50,792 --> 00:51:52,787
Oh, what's so funny,
bright eyes?

549
00:51:55,933 --> 00:51:57,698
I'm expecting company.

550
00:52:12,623 --> 00:52:14,388
Catch you fuckers
at a bad time?

551
00:52:14,849 --> 00:52:16,038
No! No guns!

552
00:52:18,071 --> 00:52:19,491
No! No! No!

553
00:52:25,975 --> 00:52:27,280
No! Fuckin' this way!

554
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:37,140
Drop the guns!

555
00:52:37,562 --> 00:52:38,444
I need him!

556
00:52:38,943 --> 00:52:41,015
He wants Blade alive! Go!

557
00:52:45,312 --> 00:52:46,732
You've been
listening in the whole time?

558
00:52:47,154 --> 00:52:48,075
Keeping
radio contact.

559
00:52:48,497 --> 00:52:51,259
Think I'd let him run loose
without a chaperon?

560
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:01,388
Christ!
I'm too old for this.

561
00:53:01,848 --> 00:53:03,920
Somebody get me
a god-damn wheelchair.

562
00:53:12,131 --> 00:53:13,167
Whistler!

563
00:53:13,589 --> 00:53:15,200
He can take care
of himself.

564
00:53:15,622 --> 00:53:16,581
Jump!

565
00:54:34,237 --> 00:54:35,886
What are you
gonna do?

566
00:54:36,922 --> 00:54:38,265
Oh, my God.

567
00:54:52,269 --> 00:54:53,765
What's wrong?

568
00:54:56,106 --> 00:54:57,871
It's dislocated.

569
00:54:59,981 --> 00:55:01,324
Let me help you.

570
00:55:12,489 --> 00:55:13,333
Let me give you...

571
00:55:13,831 --> 00:55:15,481
No! Get away.

572
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,555
You're one of them,
aren't you?

573
00:55:35,317 --> 00:55:36,545
No.

574
00:55:37,044 --> 00:55:38,272
I'm something else.

575
00:55:45,792 --> 00:55:48,093
I found him
when he was 13.

576
00:55:48,515 --> 00:55:49,974
He'd been livin'
on the streets,

577
00:55:50,434 --> 00:55:51,930
feedin' off
the homeless.

578
00:55:52,352 --> 00:55:54,731
His need for blood had
taken over at puberty.

579
00:55:55,229 --> 00:55:58,645
I took him
for a vampire at first.

580
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:00,409
Almost killed him too.

581
00:56:00,831 --> 00:56:03,364
Then I realized
what he was.

582
00:56:03,748 --> 00:56:06,395
Blade's mother was
attacked by a vampire

583
00:56:06,893 --> 00:56:08,159
while she was pregnant.

584
00:56:08,581 --> 00:56:10,999
She died, but he lived.

585
00:56:11,459 --> 00:56:12,188
Unfortunately,

586
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:14,682
he'd undergone
certain genetic changes.

587
00:56:15,104 --> 00:56:18,480
He can withstand
garlic, silver,

588
00:56:18,941 --> 00:56:20,015
even sunlight,

589
00:56:20,475 --> 00:56:21,933
and he's got
their strength.

590
00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:23,737
This time tomorrow,

591
00:56:24,197 --> 00:56:26,844
all those wounds of his
will be healed.

592
00:56:28,686 --> 00:56:30,720
He still ages
like a human though.

593
00:56:31,218 --> 00:56:33,252
See, vampires
age slower than us.

594
00:56:33,635 --> 00:56:36,628
Unfortunately...

595
00:56:37,165 --> 00:56:38,968
he also inherited
their thirst.

596
00:56:40,388 --> 00:56:42,806
I thought the serum was
supposed to suppress that.

597
00:56:43,228 --> 00:56:45,414
Time's runnin' out.

598
00:56:46,872 --> 00:56:49,712
His body's startin' to reject it.

599
00:56:50,134 --> 00:56:54,085
So far, all my efforts
to find a cure have failed.

600
00:56:58,536 --> 00:57:00,300
Why do you hunt them?

601
00:57:02,373 --> 00:57:04,368
I had a family once...

602
00:57:04,828 --> 00:57:07,015
wife and two daughters.

603
00:57:09,317 --> 00:57:11,542
Then a drifter came
callin' one evenin',

604
00:57:12,003 --> 00:57:12,962
a vampire.

605
00:57:14,996 --> 00:57:16,338
He toyed with 'em first,

606
00:57:16,684 --> 00:57:19,100
tried to make me decide

607
00:57:19,484 --> 00:57:21,134
which order
they'd die in.

608
00:57:24,702 --> 00:57:27,579
We kill as many of 'em
as we can find,

609
00:57:28,041 --> 00:57:29,115
but it's gettin' worse.

610
00:57:29,575 --> 00:57:30,688
Because of Frost.

611
00:57:31,186 --> 00:57:31,723
There's somethin'
happenin'

612
00:57:32,222 --> 00:57:34,102
in the vampire ranks.

613
00:57:34,525 --> 00:57:35,484
It's somethin' big...

614
00:57:35,944 --> 00:57:37,248
and I'd stake my life

615
00:57:37,709 --> 00:57:41,086
that son of a bitch
is at the center of it.

616
00:57:44,692 --> 00:57:45,651
Blade.

617
00:58:02,801 --> 00:58:04,566
Whistler told me
what happened.

618
00:58:07,367 --> 00:58:10,858
He told me
what you are.

619
00:58:13,543 --> 00:58:15,271
You don't know me.

620
00:58:15,693 --> 00:58:17,534
You don't know
anything about me.

621
00:58:20,757 --> 00:58:22,637
I'm not human.

622
00:58:25,207 --> 00:58:26,435
You look human
to me.

623
00:58:26,857 --> 00:58:29,313
Humans don't
drink blood.

624
00:58:29,696 --> 00:58:31,730
That was
a long time ago.

625
00:58:32,228 --> 00:58:35,068
Maybe you should
let that go.

626
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:39,288
I have spent
my whole life

627
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:42,856
looking for that thing
that killed my mother.

628
00:58:43,317 --> 00:58:45,235
It made me what I am.

629
00:58:47,959 --> 00:58:51,374
And every time I take
one of those monsters out,

630
00:58:51,872 --> 00:58:54,213
I get a little piece
of that life back,

631
00:58:54,635 --> 00:58:57,973
so don't you tell me
about forgetting.

632
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:02,731
My fault he took us
by surprise!

633
00:59:03,268 --> 00:59:04,956
Two of them against your
entire security force?

634
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:07,335
Don't put that shit on me, OK,
'cause you were there too!

635
00:59:07,834 --> 00:59:09,100
I'm sure Deacon
will appreciate...

636
00:59:09,522 --> 00:59:10,749
Stabbed in the balls
for it, all right?!

637
00:59:11,286 --> 00:59:12,053
You little skeez!

638
00:59:12,514 --> 00:59:13,704
Don't see the lifestyle
really suits you.

639
00:59:14,203 --> 00:59:15,891
I should put this stump through
that shit-eating grin of yours.

640
00:59:16,389 --> 00:59:17,502
Face it, angel.
You were sloppy.

641
00:59:17,962 --> 00:59:19,728
You got
what you deserved.

642
00:59:22,605 --> 00:59:24,868
Deac, let me
take this guy out, man.

643
00:59:25,367 --> 00:59:26,634
Look. Look what
he fuckin' did!

644
00:59:27,094 --> 00:59:27,900
He took my hand again!

645
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,125
Listen to me.
I want him alive.

646
00:59:30,508 --> 00:59:32,043
What the fuck
are you talk...

647
00:59:32,426 --> 00:59:33,540
You want him alive?

648
00:59:34,038 --> 00:59:35,995
We've been tryin' to kill
this motherfucker for years.

649
00:59:36,455 --> 00:59:38,188
Are you out of
your fuckin' mind?

650
00:59:38,949 --> 00:59:42,402
Big guy, relax.

651
00:59:42,786 --> 00:59:43,975
Be patient.

652
00:59:45,586 --> 00:59:47,620
Now, we got a lot
to do here.

653
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:49,001
I need you, man.

654
00:59:53,261 --> 00:59:53,798
I need you.

655
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:55,217
Yeah.

656
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:38,265
Morning.

657
01:00:38,649 --> 01:00:40,184
How you feelin'?

658
01:00:49,238 --> 01:00:50,197
Look at that.

659
01:00:55,064 --> 01:00:56,412
Gettin' a little
toasty out here, huh?

660
01:00:58,869 --> 01:00:59,943
When was the last time

661
01:01:00,065 --> 01:01:02,590
you stopped to appreciate
a good sunrise?

662
01:01:03,127 --> 01:01:04,892
Oh, that's right.
You were born a vampire,

663
01:01:05,353 --> 01:01:07,386
so you never had
the pleasure, have you?

664
01:01:07,546 --> 01:01:08,383
That's OK.

665
01:01:08,844 --> 01:01:09,457
It's all right.

666
01:01:09,918 --> 01:01:10,953
Least we're here together.

667
01:01:11,453 --> 01:01:12,297
Share the moment,

668
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:15,328
which means a lot to me,
by the way, really.

669
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:17,131
I mean that.

670
01:01:18,935 --> 01:01:21,351
'Cause actually, you know,
when you get to know me,

671
01:01:21,773 --> 01:01:23,653
I'm a fairly
sentimental type of guy.

672
01:01:24,152 --> 01:01:25,726
Bit of an innocent,
you might say.

673
01:01:29,025 --> 01:01:31,442
Do what you want,
Frost.

674
01:01:31,941 --> 01:01:33,744
Doesn't make
any difference.

675
01:01:35,048 --> 01:01:37,926
You just don't
fuckin' get it.

676
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:40,266
You're never
gonna be a pureblood.

677
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:41,993
Hold him.

678
01:01:44,487 --> 01:01:46,482
You will never rule us.

679
01:01:58,683 --> 01:02:00,333
Jesus Christ.

680
01:02:00,678 --> 01:02:01,445
Have a nice day.

681
01:02:01,905 --> 01:02:02,826
Sorry, you old dog.

682
01:02:03,248 --> 01:02:05,819
You just got a little
too long in the tooth.

683
01:02:07,277 --> 01:02:09,118
What, man?
That was funny.

684
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:10,730
Long tooth.
Funny.

685
01:02:11,229 --> 01:02:13,416
Did I tell you
the one about...

686
01:02:41,922 --> 01:02:43,841
What have you done
with Dragonetti?

687
01:02:50,671 --> 01:02:52,857
Let's get down to business,
shall we?

688
01:02:53,318 --> 01:02:55,811
I need 12 volunteers.

689
01:03:02,103 --> 01:03:03,025
Whistler.

690
01:03:06,247 --> 01:03:07,398
What is this?

691
01:03:09,125 --> 01:03:11,274
Smells like a vampire
wiped his ass with it.

692
01:03:11,657 --> 01:03:12,808
I took it
from the archives.

693
01:03:13,345 --> 01:03:14,343
It's written in blood.

694
01:03:14,765 --> 01:03:17,182
It's from
The Book of Erebus.

695
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:23,513
I think it's what Frost
has been workin' on.

696
01:03:23,973 --> 01:03:25,661
It's somethin'
about the Blood God,

697
01:03:26,198 --> 01:03:27,388
the spirits of the 12.

698
01:03:27,848 --> 01:03:28,462
I don't know.

699
01:03:28,923 --> 01:03:30,189
I can't make out
the rest of it.

700
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:31,800
Maybe this'll help.

701
01:03:32,836 --> 01:03:34,140
I'll figure out something.

702
01:03:35,676 --> 01:03:36,903
So what's all this?

703
01:03:37,363 --> 01:03:39,435
Took a trip to
the hospital last night,

704
01:03:39,895 --> 01:03:41,315
borrowed some equipment.

705
01:03:41,775 --> 01:03:44,308
For your
miracle cure?

706
01:03:46,149 --> 01:03:47,032
This is E.D.T.A.

707
01:03:47,454 --> 01:03:48,106
It's an anticoagulant.

708
01:03:48,567 --> 01:03:50,523
We use it
to treat blood clots.

709
01:03:50,984 --> 01:03:53,746
Now look what happens
when I introduce it

710
01:03:54,245 --> 01:03:56,547
onto a sample
of vampire blood.

711
01:03:57,698 --> 01:03:59,194
Take a step back.

712
01:03:59,578 --> 01:04:01,112
The reaction's
energetic.

713
01:04:10,244 --> 01:04:10,858
Some cure.

714
01:04:11,318 --> 01:04:13,658
I didn't say E.D.T.A.
was a cure.

715
01:04:14,195 --> 01:04:15,577
But maybe
you could use it

716
01:04:16,114 --> 01:04:18,148
to explode
some vampire heads.

717
01:04:20,526 --> 01:04:21,101
Wait a minute.

718
01:04:21,486 --> 01:04:23,212
I need a sample
of your blood.

719
01:04:23,596 --> 01:04:24,363
Later.

720
01:04:24,747 --> 01:04:26,511
Gotta go downtown.

721
01:04:26,972 --> 01:04:27,701
Need some serum.

722
01:04:28,162 --> 01:04:29,083
Serum can wait.

723
01:04:29,466 --> 01:04:31,001
This is important.

724
01:04:52,294 --> 01:04:53,560
Is he sick?

725
01:04:54,021 --> 01:04:54,981
Cancer.

726
01:04:57,206 --> 01:04:59,776
You have a lot of love
for him, don't you?

727
01:05:00,236 --> 01:05:02,002
We have
a good arrangement.

728
01:05:02,347 --> 01:05:04,840
He makes the weapons.
I use 'em.

729
01:05:08,754 --> 01:05:10,442
You know,
my mother used to say.

730
01:05:10,903 --> 01:05:13,089
A cold heart
is a dead heart.

731
01:05:30,432 --> 01:05:31,889
You don't look so good.

732
01:05:32,925 --> 01:05:34,192
I'm just a little tired.

733
01:05:34,614 --> 01:05:35,726
You know we've been...

734
01:05:36,263 --> 01:05:37,491
workin' all night.

735
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:42,326
I guess we didn't
catch it in time.

736
01:05:43,937 --> 01:05:44,973
You got another day,

737
01:05:45,394 --> 01:05:47,083
two at the most.

738
01:05:51,763 --> 01:05:53,606
For what it's worth,
I'm sorry.

739
01:05:54,104 --> 01:05:57,058
You make it sound
like I'm already dead.

740
01:06:14,401 --> 01:06:15,360
Blade.

741
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,296
How you doin', chief?

742
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:43,214
Easy.

743
01:06:45,171 --> 01:06:46,668
Wouldn't want
our little friend here

744
01:06:47,166 --> 01:06:50,005
to wind up on the back of
a milk carton, now would we?

745
01:06:51,386 --> 01:06:54,303
It's nice
to finally meet you, man.

746
01:06:54,686 --> 01:06:56,566
Had my eye on you
for years.

747
01:06:57,103 --> 01:06:58,177
I know all about you.

748
01:06:58,261 --> 01:07:01,017
Your serum, Whistler,
everything.

749
01:07:01,439 --> 01:07:03,165
Sunblock.

750
01:07:03,549 --> 01:07:05,198
Hey, it's a start, right?

751
01:07:05,583 --> 01:07:08,115
The goal, of course,
is to be like you,

752
01:07:08,498 --> 01:07:10,109
the daywalker.

753
01:07:10,531 --> 01:07:12,566
You got the best
of both worlds, don't you?

754
01:07:13,103 --> 01:07:15,174
All our strengths...

755
01:07:15,634 --> 01:07:16,517
none of our weaknesses.

756
01:07:16,939 --> 01:07:19,510
Well, maybe I don't
see it that way.

757
01:07:19,970 --> 01:07:22,425
Oh, so it's back
to pretending we're human again?

758
01:07:22,847 --> 01:07:26,071
Come on. Spare me
the Uncle Tom routine, OK?

759
01:07:26,493 --> 01:07:29,178
You can't keep denying
what you are, man.

760
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,636
You think the humans

761
01:07:31,135 --> 01:07:32,938
will ever accept
a half-breed like you?

762
01:07:33,399 --> 01:07:35,163
They can't.
They're afraid of you.

763
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:37,849
And they should be.

764
01:07:38,348 --> 01:07:38,847
You're an animal.

765
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:41,264
You're a fuckin'
maniac.

766
01:07:44,103 --> 01:07:45,216
Look at 'em.

767
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,441
They're cattle,

768
01:07:47,825 --> 01:07:49,321
pieces of meat.

769
01:07:49,743 --> 01:07:52,276
What difference does it make
how their world ends?

770
01:07:52,659 --> 01:07:53,273
Plague...

771
01:07:53,657 --> 01:07:54,654
war...

772
01:07:55,191 --> 01:07:56,265
famine.

773
01:07:56,687 --> 01:07:58,568
Morality doesn't even
enter into it.

774
01:07:59,067 --> 01:08:01,522
We're just a function
of natural selection, man,

775
01:08:01,982 --> 01:08:03,862
the new race.

776
01:08:05,436 --> 01:08:07,891
Looks like
your mascara's running.

777
01:08:14,797 --> 01:08:16,638
I'm offering you a truce.

778
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:18,250
I want you with us.

779
01:08:18,634 --> 01:08:20,514
What do you think,
I'm stupid?

780
01:08:28,724 --> 01:08:30,182
You're familiar
with the Blood God.

781
01:08:30,642 --> 01:08:32,906
Frost...

782
01:08:33,328 --> 01:08:35,438
you're nothing
to me...

783
01:08:35,899 --> 01:08:38,316
but another
dead vampire.

784
01:08:38,777 --> 01:08:40,273
You're an idiot.
You know that?

785
01:08:40,695 --> 01:08:43,227
I came down here
offering you an easy way out,

786
01:08:43,687 --> 01:08:46,565
and you spit it right back
in my fuckin' face.

787
01:08:46,987 --> 01:08:48,138
Careful.

788
01:08:52,474 --> 01:08:54,699
What do I care?

789
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:57,040
They're nothing
but cattle...

790
01:08:57,462 --> 01:08:58,804
just like you said.

791
01:08:59,265 --> 01:09:01,643
If you want to take
the hard road, be my guest, pal,

792
01:09:02,142 --> 01:09:04,559
but I promise you
by the time this is over,

793
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:07,820
you're gonna wish they never
cut you from your mother's...

794
01:09:41,315 --> 01:09:42,466
Go home.

795
01:09:45,804 --> 01:09:46,495
It was simple.

796
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:48,796
Why do vampires
need to drink blood?

797
01:09:49,257 --> 01:09:51,176
'Cause their own blood
can't sustain haemoglobin.

798
01:09:51,559 --> 01:09:52,940
Right. So it's
a genetic defect,

799
01:09:53,401 --> 01:09:54,091
just like
haemolytic anaemia.

800
01:09:54,513 --> 01:09:56,509
That means that
we have to treat it

801
01:09:56,969 --> 01:09:57,775
with gene therapy,

802
01:09:58,273 --> 01:10:00,192
rewrite the victim's DNA
with a retrovirus.

803
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:02,532
They've been using it
on sickle cell anaemia.

804
01:10:03,031 --> 01:10:04,067
Are you sure
that's safe?

805
01:10:04,527 --> 01:10:05,525
I have no idea,

806
01:10:05,947 --> 01:10:08,287
but I don't have
a choice, do I?

807
01:10:09,861 --> 01:10:11,664
You actually think
this could work?

808
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:13,582
On me...

809
01:10:14,004 --> 01:10:15,231
yes.

810
01:10:15,692 --> 01:10:17,687
On Blade,
I'm not so sure.

811
01:10:18,263 --> 01:10:19,414
See, he didn't
contract vampirism

812
01:10:19,797 --> 01:10:21,217
from a bite
like I did.

813
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,714
He was born with it.

814
01:10:23,174 --> 01:10:24,824
It's part of his DNA.

815
01:10:25,246 --> 01:10:27,624
I'm sure I can cure
his thirst,

816
01:10:28,084 --> 01:10:29,236
but it's gonna
take time.

817
01:10:29,696 --> 01:10:31,576
We're out of time.

818
01:10:32,036 --> 01:10:34,261
You saw what was
on that disc.

819
01:10:38,827 --> 01:10:40,170
Damn.

820
01:10:42,166 --> 01:10:43,202
Get out of here.

821
01:11:07,104 --> 01:11:09,215
I said get out of here!

822
01:11:14,624 --> 01:11:15,584
Nice place.

823
01:11:16,121 --> 01:11:18,269
Took us a while
to find it!

824
01:11:25,175 --> 01:11:26,709
Bite me
and get it over with.

825
01:11:27,131 --> 01:11:28,859
I ain't gonna bite you.

826
01:11:41,673 --> 01:11:42,632
Do your thing.

827
01:11:54,565 --> 01:11:55,754
Whistler.

828
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:02,935
Frost took her.

829
01:13:10,455 --> 01:13:11,797
Listen to me.

830
01:13:14,752 --> 01:13:15,788
The disc.

831
01:13:17,207 --> 01:13:18,281
He decoded it.

832
01:13:18,742 --> 01:13:21,275
Frost is trying to...

833
01:13:21,735 --> 01:13:24,996
trigger a fuckin'
vampire apocalypse.

834
01:13:27,145 --> 01:13:28,986
There's some kind of...

835
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:32,477
Vampire God he's trying
to resurrect.

836
01:13:34,051 --> 01:13:35,547
La Magra.

837
01:13:38,808 --> 01:13:40,420
You're the key.

838
01:13:41,839 --> 01:13:43,489
He needs
your blood.

839
01:13:47,249 --> 01:13:49,244
The blood
of the daywalker.

840
01:13:51,699 --> 01:13:54,232
You're the chosen one.

841
01:13:57,685 --> 01:13:58,912
Listen to me, Blade.

842
01:14:00,409 --> 01:14:01,829
You can't
go after him.

843
01:14:02,289 --> 01:14:03,517
Bullshit.

844
01:14:04,054 --> 01:14:05,704
If Frost gets
his hands on you,

845
01:14:06,203 --> 01:14:08,504
it's all over.

846
01:14:11,305 --> 01:14:13,914
There'll be armies
of the motherfuckers.

847
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:17,520
Shit.

848
01:14:21,626 --> 01:14:23,659
You're gonna have
to finish me off.

849
01:14:24,081 --> 01:14:27,266
Don't want me
coming back.

850
01:14:29,108 --> 01:14:30,834
We can treat
the wounds.

851
01:14:32,561 --> 01:14:33,789
It's too far gone.

852
01:14:34,249 --> 01:14:36,397
You know that.

853
01:14:39,582 --> 01:14:42,114
Give me your gun.

854
01:14:43,418 --> 01:14:44,954
No.

855
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:48,675
Give me
the god-damn gun.

856
01:15:12,693 --> 01:15:13,652
Now walk away,

857
01:15:14,074 --> 01:15:16,299
you stupid
son of a bitch.

858
01:15:20,942 --> 01:15:23,205
Walk the fuck away.

859
01:15:43,271 --> 01:15:44,116
By the time you watch this,

860
01:15:44,653 --> 01:15:45,766
your friend Whistler
should be dead.

861
01:15:46,264 --> 01:15:47,645
If it makes any
difference to you,

862
01:15:48,182 --> 01:15:49,333
he put up
quite a fight.

863
01:15:49,755 --> 01:15:52,326
You can find us
at the Edgewood Towers.

864
01:17:26,556 --> 01:17:27,515
You seem a bit...

865
01:17:27,937 --> 01:17:28,589
tense.

866
01:17:29,012 --> 01:17:30,547
A bit pent-up maybe,

867
01:17:31,045 --> 01:17:32,426
like you need to
release something.

868
01:17:33,424 --> 01:17:34,191
You know?

869
01:17:34,536 --> 01:17:35,573
Blade not...

870
01:17:36,839 --> 01:17:38,949
givin' it to you
maybe.

871
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:40,944
I don't know.
I just...

872
01:17:42,479 --> 01:17:44,359
I see such
a beautiful woman.

873
01:17:46,008 --> 01:17:47,197
Great skin.

874
01:17:49,845 --> 01:17:51,533
I'd like to see you
happy, that's all.

875
01:17:51,955 --> 01:17:55,024
Is this the part where
you offer to turn me?

876
01:17:56,483 --> 01:17:58,516
Well, it's either that
or a body bag.

877
01:17:58,861 --> 01:18:00,204
Go ahead.

878
01:18:00,626 --> 01:18:01,623
Bite me.

879
01:18:02,123 --> 01:18:04,540
I'll just cure myself.

880
01:18:05,115 --> 01:18:05,998
I did it before,

881
01:18:06,458 --> 01:18:07,647
and I can do it again.

882
01:18:08,107 --> 01:18:09,451
There is no cure,
baby.

883
01:18:09,873 --> 01:18:10,986
There is if you've
been bit,

884
01:18:11,446 --> 01:18:14,553
if you were once human.

885
01:18:19,771 --> 01:18:20,730
How'd you get
that scar, Deacon?

886
01:18:21,114 --> 01:18:22,112
A born vampire

887
01:18:22,534 --> 01:18:24,798
would have the power
to regenerate from birth.

888
01:18:25,258 --> 01:18:27,905
You must've gotten scarred
before you were turned.

889
01:18:28,405 --> 01:18:29,287
Isn't that right?

890
01:18:29,709 --> 01:18:32,586
Vampires like you
aren't a species.

891
01:18:33,046 --> 01:18:35,656
You're just infected,
a virus...

892
01:18:36,116 --> 01:18:37,727
a sexually transmitted
disease.

893
01:18:38,149 --> 01:18:39,185
I'll tell you
what we are, sister.

894
01:18:39,607 --> 01:18:41,641
We're the top of
the fuckin' food chain.

895
01:18:42,102 --> 01:18:43,674
The Blood God's coming
and after tonight,

896
01:18:44,173 --> 01:18:45,516
you people
are fuckin' history.

897
01:18:47,165 --> 01:18:48,202
He's a hurricane,

898
01:18:48,624 --> 01:18:50,274
an act of God.

899
01:18:50,657 --> 01:18:52,000
Anyone caught
in his path

900
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:53,496
will instantly
be turned.

901
01:18:55,338 --> 01:18:56,604
Everyone you've
ever known,

902
01:18:57,065 --> 01:18:59,673
everyone you've ever
fucking loved.

903
01:19:00,172 --> 01:19:01,554
It won't matter
who's pureblood

904
01:19:02,129 --> 01:19:03,242
and who's not.

905
01:19:03,625 --> 01:19:06,157
How are you gonna cure
the whole fuckin' world?

906
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,599
And Blade's blood
is the key.

907
01:19:15,136 --> 01:19:16,632
We got an intruder.

908
01:19:44,563 --> 01:19:45,445
Deac, I don't think
you understand.

909
01:19:45,829 --> 01:19:46,711
I mean, this dude
is fuckin' bad.

910
01:19:47,173 --> 01:19:48,784
He's, like, he had
20 guys around him...

911
01:19:49,206 --> 01:19:50,548
and he's got shit
he throws at you...

912
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:52,121
Yeah, the swords.

913
01:19:52,582 --> 01:19:53,465
Throw it in the air,
catch it underneath.

914
01:19:53,810 --> 01:19:55,076
Yeah. Shut the fuck up!

915
01:19:55,536 --> 01:19:56,495
There's no
intruder where we are.

916
01:19:56,917 --> 01:19:58,298
Look, make it happen,
all right?

917
01:19:58,682 --> 01:19:59,794
It's one guy on foot.

918
01:20:04,284 --> 01:20:05,818
That's him!
Get him!

919
01:20:24,542 --> 01:20:26,076
Why am I hearing
gunfire?

920
01:20:26,422 --> 01:20:28,724
Did I tell anybody
to start shooting?

921
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:30,182
I need him alive.

922
01:20:30,489 --> 01:20:31,601
No!

923
01:20:34,134 --> 01:20:36,014
Please!

924
01:20:36,474 --> 01:20:37,548
I just work for them!

925
01:20:39,774 --> 01:20:41,232
Jesus Christ.
Lock this place down.

926
01:20:41,654 --> 01:20:42,613
Yes, sir!

927
01:22:25,552 --> 01:22:27,164
Eric?

928
01:22:37,907 --> 01:22:39,403
But you died.

929
01:22:40,707 --> 01:22:42,664
I came back, Eric.

930
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:44,391
That very same night...

931
01:22:46,155 --> 01:22:48,457
when Deacon welcomed me
into his arms.

932
01:23:04,802 --> 01:23:07,257
Jesus Christ. I thought
you'd be happy.

933
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:08,677
You're finally being
reunited with your mother,

934
01:23:09,137 --> 01:23:10,366
and you act like this?

935
01:23:12,092 --> 01:23:13,933
Blade, give it up.
It's over.

936
01:23:14,317 --> 01:23:16,005
She belongs to me,
buddy.

937
01:23:19,228 --> 01:23:20,302
Don't look so surprised.

938
01:23:20,762 --> 01:23:21,952
You spent your whole life

939
01:23:22,527 --> 01:23:24,791
looking for the vampire
who bit your mother.

940
01:23:25,252 --> 01:23:27,093
Well, here I am.

941
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,163
Who would ever guess

942
01:23:30,585 --> 01:23:32,618
you'd survive
your mother's death?

943
01:23:33,078 --> 01:23:33,961
But you did.

944
01:23:34,344 --> 01:23:35,534
And here we are.

945
01:23:35,956 --> 01:23:38,258
One big happy
fuckin' family.

946
01:23:49,192 --> 01:23:50,804
I need my serum.

947
01:23:53,451 --> 01:23:54,334
Maybe when we
get outta this,

948
01:23:54,717 --> 01:23:56,483
I'll take that
miracle cure of yours.

949
01:23:56,943 --> 01:23:58,439
There's one catch.

950
01:24:02,237 --> 01:24:03,734
If it works,

951
01:24:04,156 --> 01:24:05,039
you'll lose
your strength

952
01:24:05,499 --> 01:24:09,335
and your ability
to regenerate.

953
01:24:09,758 --> 01:24:11,638
You'll be
completely human.

954
01:25:11,068 --> 01:25:13,293
Blade, Karen,

955
01:25:13,677 --> 01:25:15,213
glad you could make it.

956
01:25:15,673 --> 01:25:17,859
Hey, man. Thanks
for the shades.

957
01:25:19,125 --> 01:25:21,120
Our ancestors
called this place

958
01:25:21,542 --> 01:25:23,691
the Temple
of Eternal Night.

959
01:25:26,684 --> 01:25:28,181
Nice, isn't it?

960
01:25:28,526 --> 01:25:30,943
Apparently, these geniuses
forgot it ever existed.

961
01:25:31,441 --> 01:25:33,666
Fortunately for us...

962
01:25:34,127 --> 01:25:35,087
I'm what you
might call a...

963
01:25:35,509 --> 01:25:37,925
student of history.

964
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:52,697
Why are we here?

965
01:25:54,231 --> 01:25:58,107
This temple was built
for one glorious moment...

966
01:25:58,529 --> 01:26:01,752
this night,
for the Blood God.

967
01:26:09,655 --> 01:26:10,883
Thanks.

968
01:26:15,986 --> 01:26:17,482
Let's see
this sword of yours.

969
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:21,933
Well.

970
01:26:22,355 --> 01:26:23,045
Titanium, right?

971
01:26:23,506 --> 01:26:25,347
Acid-etched?

972
01:26:27,150 --> 01:26:29,721
I'll get used
to a weapon like this.

973
01:26:35,246 --> 01:26:35,822
What?

974
01:26:36,321 --> 01:26:38,622
You look surprised.

975
01:26:39,159 --> 01:26:40,311
I told you, Blade,

976
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:42,498
I know everything
about you.

977
01:26:43,533 --> 01:26:44,646
Hold out your arm,
Quinn.

978
01:26:45,068 --> 01:26:45,835
Why, man?

979
01:26:46,180 --> 01:26:46,872
These are... they're,
like, all better.

980
01:26:47,256 --> 01:26:48,138
Hold out your arm.

981
01:26:48,598 --> 01:26:49,557
Now.

982
01:26:53,433 --> 01:26:54,430
Deac, I...

983
01:26:59,455 --> 01:27:00,415
Just kidding.

984
01:27:02,964 --> 01:27:04,137
He was fuckin'
with me.

985
01:27:04,559 --> 01:27:05,786
He was, like,
fuckin'...

986
01:27:06,323 --> 01:27:06,823
Blade.

987
01:27:07,322 --> 01:27:09,163
Blade.

988
01:27:09,585 --> 01:27:10,275
He can't hear you,
honey.

989
01:27:10,621 --> 01:27:12,193
The thirst has
got him now.

990
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:19,406
What do we have here?

991
01:27:19,829 --> 01:27:22,169
The precious serum.

992
01:27:23,715 --> 01:27:25,852
How long's it been
since you shot up?

993
01:27:26,275 --> 01:27:28,577
12, 13 hours maybe?

994
01:27:29,037 --> 01:27:30,802
I bet you're just
dying for a drink,

995
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:32,413
aren't you?

996
01:27:34,792 --> 01:27:35,943
What's it feel like?

997
01:27:37,861 --> 01:27:39,357
Is your blood on fire?

998
01:27:39,742 --> 01:27:41,698
Try some.

999
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:44,307
You might like it.

1000
01:27:44,729 --> 01:27:46,686
Thanks, but I prefer
the real thing.

1001
01:27:47,185 --> 01:27:48,950
In any event,

1002
01:27:49,448 --> 01:27:51,405
I don't think you'll be
needing these any more.

1003
01:27:58,503 --> 01:27:59,885
It's a shame, you know?

1004
01:28:01,112 --> 01:28:02,378
When I think of what
you've become,

1005
01:28:02,762 --> 01:28:04,948
what you should
have become.

1006
01:28:05,409 --> 01:28:06,944
I guess
I don't blame you.

1007
01:28:07,366 --> 01:28:08,632
I mean, with everything
that's happened,

1008
01:28:09,169 --> 01:28:10,090
it's the human
side of you

1009
01:28:10,512 --> 01:28:11,739
that's made you weak.

1010
01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:13,351
You should've listened
to your blood.

1011
01:28:13,812 --> 01:28:15,653
Say what you want,

1012
01:28:16,075 --> 01:28:18,722
but I promise you,
you'll be dead by dawn.

1013
01:28:22,713 --> 01:28:24,592
Get him outta here.

1014
01:28:28,852 --> 01:28:30,770
Get these fucks
downstairs. Now.

1015
01:28:31,230 --> 01:28:32,574
Come on. Let's go.

1016
01:28:33,072 --> 01:28:34,683
Let's go.

1017
01:28:38,521 --> 01:28:39,403
Don't worry,
sweetheart.

1018
01:28:39,902 --> 01:28:40,554
We haven't
forgotten about you.

1019
01:28:41,014 --> 01:28:41,896
Oh, no, baby.

1020
01:28:42,318 --> 01:28:45,158
We got something real
special planned for you.

1021
01:28:46,386 --> 01:28:47,613
That surfer boy
had a nice ass.

1022
01:28:48,074 --> 01:28:48,956
I sucked him dry.

1023
01:28:49,378 --> 01:28:50,682
And you'd figure
he'd turn, man.

1024
01:28:51,181 --> 01:28:52,026
Yeah, but he didn't
turn, did he?

1025
01:28:52,486 --> 01:28:53,407
No. He turned into
some kinda zombie.

1026
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:55,248
It happens
sometimes, cutie.

1027
01:28:57,128 --> 01:28:57,742
He was fuckin'
tripped out.

1028
01:28:58,203 --> 01:28:59,124
Pathetic.

1029
01:28:59,546 --> 01:29:01,118
Yeah. These guys
are complete scums, man.

1030
01:29:01,579 --> 01:29:02,461
They'll eat anything...

1031
01:29:02,883 --> 01:29:06,413
animals, rodents, corpses,
and sometimes...

1032
01:29:07,718 --> 01:29:08,638
They'll even
eat vampires.

1033
01:29:09,175 --> 01:29:10,288
That's a plus.

1034
01:29:10,710 --> 01:29:11,708
And bearing that
all in mind,

1035
01:29:12,169 --> 01:29:13,933
I'd like you to meet
an old friend of yours.

1036
01:29:19,803 --> 01:29:20,456
It's too bad.

1037
01:29:20,878 --> 01:29:23,218
I kinda liked her.

1038
01:29:23,563 --> 01:29:24,676
What a waste.

1039
01:29:45,586 --> 01:29:47,389
I don't know what's
happening to me.

1040
01:29:48,579 --> 01:29:49,960
No pulse.

1041
01:29:50,458 --> 01:29:51,265
And, of course,

1042
01:29:51,687 --> 01:29:53,413
there's the question
of lividity.

1043
01:29:55,178 --> 01:29:56,329
Curtis?

1044
01:30:00,051 --> 01:30:01,777
Karen?

1045
01:30:02,889 --> 01:30:03,888
Karen.

1046
01:30:05,192 --> 01:30:07,225
I never thought
I would see you again.

1047
01:30:07,647 --> 01:30:09,105
Tell me, Karen,

1048
01:30:09,527 --> 01:30:11,484
do you ever have
second thoughts about us?

1049
01:30:29,056 --> 01:30:30,361
Karen!

1050
01:30:30,745 --> 01:30:32,624
Karen!

1051
01:30:33,123 --> 01:30:34,274
Karen!

1052
01:30:35,501 --> 01:30:37,459
Karen!

1053
01:30:37,919 --> 01:30:39,147
Karen.

1054
01:30:39,530 --> 01:30:41,487
Karen!

1055
01:31:43,834 --> 01:31:45,330
Poor child.

1056
01:31:47,057 --> 01:31:48,514
You're so sick.

1057
01:31:49,858 --> 01:31:51,546
So thirsty.

1058
01:31:52,006 --> 01:31:54,154
Don't touch me.

1059
01:31:56,610 --> 01:31:58,989
Eric, look at me.

1060
01:31:59,488 --> 01:32:01,636
Vampires are
my people now.

1061
01:32:02,136 --> 01:32:04,360
I'm one of them.

1062
01:32:04,706 --> 01:32:06,048
Can't be.

1063
01:32:07,506 --> 01:32:09,195
Yes, it can.

1064
01:32:11,497 --> 01:32:13,837
Try to understand,
Eric.

1065
01:32:14,949 --> 01:32:18,058
Your mother died
a long time ago.

1066
01:32:20,398 --> 01:32:21,664
I've hunted...

1067
01:32:23,314 --> 01:32:24,733
I've killed...

1068
01:32:26,997 --> 01:32:28,724
and I've enjoyed it.

1069
01:32:30,412 --> 01:32:31,524
Haven't you?

1070
01:32:33,212 --> 01:32:34,555
I know you have.

1071
01:32:36,704 --> 01:32:37,855
Sooner or later,

1072
01:32:38,354 --> 01:32:40,310
the thirst
always wins.

1073
01:33:22,898 --> 01:33:24,049
Come on.

1074
01:33:30,533 --> 01:33:31,646
Spread them out.

1075
01:33:32,835 --> 01:33:35,253
One on each glyph,
under the towers.

1076
01:33:35,675 --> 01:33:37,363
Make it perfect.

1077
01:34:13,927 --> 01:34:15,193
Yeah.

1078
01:34:16,344 --> 01:34:17,993
Bring the elevator up.

1079
01:34:55,785 --> 01:34:57,742
You stupid girl.

1080
01:34:58,240 --> 01:34:58,854
What do you think
is going to happen?

1081
01:34:59,354 --> 01:34:59,853
La Magra?

1082
01:35:00,313 --> 01:35:01,195
The Blood God?

1083
01:35:01,579 --> 01:35:02,730
That's nothing more
than a fairy tale

1084
01:35:03,228 --> 01:35:04,840
for pretty
little vampires.

1085
01:35:05,261 --> 01:35:06,068
Then why are you
sweating, pureblood?

1086
01:35:06,490 --> 01:35:09,827
You're afraid we're
gonna steal your soul,

1087
01:35:10,249 --> 01:35:12,322
your pureblood spirit.

1088
01:35:12,744 --> 01:35:14,278
You should be.

1089
01:35:14,700 --> 01:35:15,890
Read the prophecy.

1090
01:35:16,350 --> 01:35:17,309
It's time you fucks

1091
01:35:17,693 --> 01:35:19,381
contributed something
to the cause.

1092
01:35:23,179 --> 01:35:24,330
Even
if Frost is right,

1093
01:35:24,752 --> 01:35:27,400
you really think
he cares about you?

1094
01:35:27,745 --> 01:35:28,551
You're gonna die,

1095
01:35:28,973 --> 01:35:30,239
just like
the rest of us.

1096
01:35:54,717 --> 01:35:55,753
Blade.

1097
01:36:04,654 --> 01:36:07,801
Tonight, the age of man
comes to an end.

1098
01:36:08,299 --> 01:36:09,450
No more compromises.

1099
01:36:09,872 --> 01:36:12,060
We're gonna be gods.

1100
01:36:13,632 --> 01:36:14,438
Of course we are.

1101
01:36:14,822 --> 01:36:17,584
Yeah!

1102
01:36:18,045 --> 01:36:19,042
I'm gonna be naughty.

1103
01:36:19,426 --> 01:36:21,267
I'm gonna be a naughty
Vampire God.

1104
01:36:29,478 --> 01:36:30,859
Gotta stop...

1105
01:36:32,471 --> 01:36:33,468
stop...

1106
01:36:33,890 --> 01:36:35,540
Save your strength.

1107
01:36:36,039 --> 01:36:36,959
Blue.

1108
01:36:38,264 --> 01:36:39,607
You're hypovolemic.

1109
01:36:40,029 --> 01:36:41,103
You're bleeding
to death.

1110
01:36:41,564 --> 01:36:43,060
Need...

1111
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,327
serum.

1112
01:37:01,898 --> 01:37:02,857
Blade.

1113
01:37:04,584 --> 01:37:06,464
Blade.

1114
01:37:08,651 --> 01:37:09,687
Listen to me.

1115
01:37:11,337 --> 01:37:13,562
I want you to take
some of my blood.

1116
01:37:15,327 --> 01:37:16,631
No.

1117
01:37:18,895 --> 01:37:20,008
No.

1118
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:23,345
Look, just do it.

1119
01:37:48,016 --> 01:37:49,051
Is everybody thirsty?

1120
01:37:49,473 --> 01:37:52,812
I hope you're all
very fucking thirsty.

1121
01:38:13,185 --> 01:38:14,259
Don't stop.

1122
01:38:17,290 --> 01:38:18,326
Don't stop.

1123
01:38:23,467 --> 01:38:24,465
Don't stop.

1124
01:38:38,507 --> 01:38:39,850
Don't stop.

1125
01:39:29,881 --> 01:39:31,454
How was it?

1126
01:40:39,555 --> 01:40:40,861
Eric...

1127
01:40:41,896 --> 01:40:43,431
I'm your mother.

1128
01:40:45,579 --> 01:40:47,920
You wouldn't hurt
your mother...

1129
01:40:48,380 --> 01:40:49,340
would you?

1130
01:40:51,986 --> 01:40:52,984
Come here.

1131
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:59,391
I must release you.

1132
01:41:09,904 --> 01:41:10,825
Fuck!

1133
01:42:13,249 --> 01:42:14,170
Deacon?

1134
01:42:14,553 --> 01:42:15,666
Not anymore.

1135
01:42:31,012 --> 01:42:32,586
Frost!

1136
01:42:33,046 --> 01:42:33,660
Kill him.

1137
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:35,693
Wait! I owe you, man.

1138
01:42:36,154 --> 01:42:37,535
I got two new hands, Blade.

1139
01:42:37,995 --> 01:42:40,259
I don't know which one
to use to kill you with!

1140
01:42:59,788 --> 01:43:01,515
Frost.

1141
01:44:20,014 --> 01:44:22,062
I'm really going to
enjoy this now.

1142
01:45:08,625 --> 01:45:10,199
Hey, Blade.

1143
01:45:12,078 --> 01:45:13,958
Let's do this.

1144
01:46:05,447 --> 01:46:07,097
You're too late, Blade.

1145
01:46:25,858 --> 01:46:26,971
My turn.

1146
01:46:52,408 --> 01:46:53,176
Look at you.

1147
01:46:53,598 --> 01:46:54,788
You're a little bitch.

1148
01:46:56,591 --> 01:46:58,087
What, your serum?

1149
01:46:58,471 --> 01:46:59,928
It can't help you
now, stud.

1150
01:47:07,103 --> 01:47:08,101
Nice shot.

1151
01:47:39,063 --> 01:47:39,753
Some motherfuckers

1152
01:47:40,214 --> 01:47:42,938
are always trying
to ice-skate uphill.

1153
01:48:13,632 --> 01:48:15,167
Blade!

1154
01:48:22,917 --> 01:48:24,720
Let's get out of here.

1155
01:48:59,328 --> 01:49:00,824
I need to get back
to the lab

1156
01:49:01,284 --> 01:49:03,701
if I'm going to cure you.

1157
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:05,658
It's not over.

1158
01:49:06,157 --> 01:49:07,500
You keep your cure.

1159
01:49:08,574 --> 01:49:09,993
There's still
a war going on,

1160
01:49:10,454 --> 01:49:12,373
and I have a job to do.

1161
01:49:12,833 --> 01:49:14,521
