
1
00:02:52,534 --> 00:02:54,469
You join us
live outside the state prison...

2
00:02:54,536 --> 00:02:56,672
to witness the arrival
of Nathan and Erin Randall,

3
00:02:56,738 --> 00:03:00,642
the father and sister
of the murdered Lauren Randall.

4
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,478
The impending state execution of
Alex Corvis may provide the Randalls,

5
00:03:03,545 --> 00:03:07,783
and what seems the majority of this
crowd, with some form of justice.

6
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:11,786
- Why are there so many?
-Just hold on to me.

7
00:03:14,355 --> 00:03:16,158
Back, back.

8
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:20,361
Mr. Randall, sir, do
you think this execution...

9
00:03:20,428 --> 00:03:22,530
will bring you a sense of closure
for you and your daughter?

10
00:03:22,597 --> 00:03:25,900
Erin, your sister has been
gone for three years now.

11
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:28,036
Can you tell us anything?

12
00:03:32,808 --> 00:03:35,211
A difficult time
for everyone involved.

13
00:03:35,277 --> 00:03:38,980
Interesting fact: It will take
about 21 cents of electricity...

14
00:03:39,047 --> 00:03:42,985
to execute Alex Corvis tonight,
on this, his 21st birthday.

15
00:03:52,861 --> 00:03:55,898
He didn't order that.

16
00:03:55,965 --> 00:03:59,101
We found the man
with the scar.

17
00:04:02,671 --> 00:04:05,107
Go ahead,
make a wish.

18
00:04:07,676 --> 00:04:10,212
Get it out of here.

19
00:04:22,525 --> 00:04:24,793
Oh, yes, I've come to a lot
of these over the years,

20
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,797
but this one has, well,
many unique aspects.

21
00:04:28,864 --> 00:04:33,703
The youth of the condemned.
Now, that's unusual.

22
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,740
And 53 stab wounds!
Hmph! Kind of a record.

23
00:04:56,725 --> 00:05:00,997
- And Corvis still
maintaining his innocence?
- Oh, they all say that.

24
00:05:01,064 --> 00:05:05,067
I saw those two fighting that day.
Facing the chair,
you do what you gotta do.

25
00:05:08,537 --> 00:05:10,773
You okay?

26
00:05:15,412 --> 00:05:17,914
What's been
holding me together...

27
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:21,951
is the hope that maybe
you do go someplace.

28
00:05:23,987 --> 00:05:27,022
I'll be seein' her
again soon, you know.

29
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:32,795
Only what can I say?

30
00:05:32,863 --> 00:05:37,868
That I was too stupid
to find the guy that killed her?

31
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:40,870
That he's down here laughin'?

32
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,176
Tell her...
we'll get him.

33
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:50,347
"We" won't.

34
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:57,554
Someday he'll surface,
and I'll get him for both of you.

35
00:05:57,621 --> 00:06:01,558
I promise.
I'll find the guy with the scar.

36
00:06:04,694 --> 00:06:07,764
This mystery man with the scar,
the zigzag, whatever?

37
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:11,768
We couldn't find him.
Obviously the jury didn't buy it.

38
00:06:11,835 --> 00:06:13,938
-Some people here seem to.
- Look.

39
00:06:14,005 --> 00:06:17,841
People here are protesting
execution of a kid turned 21 .

40
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:22,113
A kid who had a tough life.
No parents, no dough,
always had to fight for everything.

41
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,016
It's a tragedy.
It really is.

42
00:06:28,985 --> 00:06:31,788
If I was facing the hot seat,
I'd want my attorney...

43
00:06:31,855 --> 00:06:35,059
banging down the door to the Supreme
Court, not playing some board game.

44
00:06:35,126 --> 00:06:37,895
But maybe that's just me.

45
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:45,435
Your move.

46
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:50,574
No. It's time.

47
00:07:19,103 --> 00:07:21,406
I don't want you to watch.

48
00:07:21,472 --> 00:07:24,442
I don't want to give 'em
the pleasure.

49
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,212
Come on now.

50
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,979
"The Lord
is my shepherd, I shall not want.

51
00:08:01,046 --> 00:08:04,683
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

52
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,986
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

53
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:13,025
He restoreth my soul.

54
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:17,529
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for His name's sake.

55
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:22,467
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

56
00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:24,802
I will fear no evil...

57
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:27,805
for Thou art with me.

58
00:08:27,872 --> 00:08:31,043
Thy rod and Thy staff,
they comfort me.

59
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,047
Thou preparest a table
before me...

60
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,549
in the presence
of mine enemies.

61
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:41,787
Thou anointest my head
with oil.

62
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,789
My cup runneth over.

63
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:48,027
Surely goodness and mercy...

64
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:50,429
shall follow me...

65
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,599
all the days of my life...

66
00:08:53,665 --> 00:08:58,504
and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever."

67
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:17,457
Alexander Frederick Corvis,
do you have any last words?

68
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,200
I loved Lauren.

69
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:31,037
I still do.

70
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,309
I'm innocent.

71
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,121
Murderer!

72
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,742
Look at that.

73
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:50,511
Goddamn helmet
melted his skin off.

74
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:52,814
That's what I call
a deterrent.

75
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:57,151
Oops.

76
00:11:57,218 --> 00:12:00,989
Why do they bother
autopsying these guys?

77
00:12:01,056 --> 00:12:04,525
I mean, the cause of death
is pretty fucking obvious.

78
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:15,803
Go on to the car,
honey. Go on.

79
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:19,942
Mr. Randall, we all wish this
would have ended better, sir.

80
00:14:39,449 --> 00:14:42,051
We've got unauthorized
movement on B-5.

81
00:15:15,986 --> 00:15:21,758
I repeat. Unauthorized movement, B-4,
B-2, all of section " B" and section "C."

82
00:15:23,594 --> 00:15:26,564
We have an escape in progress.
I repeat, an escape in progress.

83
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,900
- Mercer, are you down there?
- This is Mercer. I'm on it.

84
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:33,403
They're heading
for the roof.

85
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,358
All prisoners present and accounted for.

86
00:16:27,425 --> 00:16:30,529
Then who's fucking Houdini?

87
00:17:13,505 --> 00:17:17,776
- What? Police? Evidence?

88
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:01,286
There's nothing
under "Crow."

89
00:18:16,335 --> 00:18:19,704
" Execution"?

90
00:18:21,641 --> 00:18:23,709
- Lauren!

91
00:18:42,462 --> 00:18:45,765
What are you trying
to say here?

92
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:51,771
I'm all yours.

93
00:19:39,486 --> 00:19:41,455
His knife!

94
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,692
- Corvis.
-  You lie!

95
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,195
You lie!

96
00:20:05,212 --> 00:20:07,681
Thomas Leonard.

97
00:20:28,635 --> 00:20:30,571
Shit.

98
00:21:15,082 --> 00:21:18,285
I thought
I'd be with you now.

99
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,927
I'm not dead.

100
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,463
And I'm not alive.

101
00:21:30,098 --> 00:21:32,667
And I'm remembering.

102
00:21:32,734 --> 00:21:34,803
And it hurts.

103
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:40,842
Your Shaolin style
is no match for my kung fu.

104
00:21:43,945 --> 00:21:46,815
Your flying crane style...

105
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,253
is no match for
my drunken tiger kick.

106
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,422
Aww.

107
00:21:54,489 --> 00:21:58,393
Your mad monkey love...

108
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,462
is no match--

109
00:22:03,398 --> 00:22:06,101
I can't be alive.

110
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:08,269
Not without you.

111
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:14,409
I want to be with you
forever.

112
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:19,514
- I want to be with you forever.
- Only forever?

113
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:47,137
It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

114
00:23:47,204 --> 00:23:49,105
Don't come near me!

115
00:23:49,171 --> 00:23:53,210
- I was a friend of your sister's.
- I know her friends.

116
00:23:53,277 --> 00:23:58,048
That locket
you're holding.

117
00:23:58,115 --> 00:24:00,717
- You have one just like it.
- No kidding.

118
00:24:00,784 --> 00:24:02,886
Your father gave them
to both of you.

119
00:24:02,953 --> 00:24:06,056
He's right over there
by the way.

120
00:24:06,123 --> 00:24:08,926
What did you do
to your face?

121
00:24:08,992 --> 00:24:13,964
- Someone else did it.
- You're a friend of the guy
who killed Lauren, aren't you?

122
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:17,067
- You almost sound like him.
- He didn't kill her.

123
00:24:17,067 --> 00:24:22,673
- How do you know?
- I know everything about your sister.

124
00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:25,275
I'll prove it to you.

125
00:24:25,342 --> 00:24:28,111
Stay away from me!
Dad!

126
00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:31,181
Dad!

127
00:24:32,316 --> 00:24:34,785
- Dad.
- Are you all right?

128
00:24:34,851 --> 00:24:38,455
There's this guy.
He said he was a friend of Lauren's.
He had paint all over his face.

129
00:24:38,522 --> 00:24:40,791
He was here!

130
00:24:40,857 --> 00:24:42,893
He was right here!

131
00:25:58,002 --> 00:25:59,504
Marcy!

132
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,244
She's resting, Thomas.

133
00:26:07,445 --> 00:26:09,614
Where the fuck
did you come from?

134
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:13,818
Big bang, primordial ooze?

135
00:26:13,885 --> 00:26:16,688
Divine hand
ofa benevolent creator?

136
00:26:16,688 --> 00:26:20,625
All possibilities. Although,
recent events have given me doubts...

137
00:26:20,692 --> 00:26:23,795
about the
benevolent creator.

138
00:26:23,861 --> 00:26:28,132
- You lied at my trial, Thomas.
- I don't even know you, man.

139
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,604
Capital case 99-C1 1 5.

140
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:36,074
Alex Corvis!

141
00:26:37,542 --> 00:26:40,079
Exhibit "A."

142
00:26:40,144 --> 00:26:43,781
Hey, I said what I saw.
Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.

143
00:26:43,848 --> 00:26:46,784
No, you said you saw me
with this.

144
00:26:47,887 --> 00:26:50,256
I never held it
until today.

145
00:26:50,322 --> 00:26:55,094
What's your damage, man? Corvis hacked
up that girl like a motherfucker!

146
00:27:02,533 --> 00:27:06,772
One chance to tell
the truth, Tommy.

147
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,977
Who is the man
with the scar?

148
00:27:12,044 --> 00:27:15,247
He planted this
in my car.

149
00:27:15,247 --> 00:27:18,150
There's no scar.
Corvis made it up.

150
00:27:18,217 --> 00:27:20,686
Wrong answer!

151
00:27:22,988 --> 00:27:27,259
They showed me pictures,
what he did to her.

152
00:27:27,326 --> 00:27:29,795
Evidence.

153
00:27:29,862 --> 00:27:34,099
Said all I had to do was
stand up there and nod my head "yes."

154
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:37,002
What did they give you?

155
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:39,038
Ajob!

156
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:42,641
Construction.

157
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:48,781
Twelve an hour.

158
00:27:52,252 --> 00:27:54,488
Write their names down.

159
00:27:57,324 --> 00:27:59,725
You've already got 'em all
right here.

160
00:27:59,793 --> 00:28:03,562
These cops said they needed
an eyewitness or Corvis would walk.

161
00:28:44,571 --> 00:28:46,640
Oh.

162
00:28:51,578 --> 00:28:53,513
Is there a problem?

163
00:28:53,579 --> 00:28:56,383
Let's hope not.

164
00:28:56,449 --> 00:29:00,453
- License and registration, please.
- Yeah.

165
00:29:01,689 --> 00:29:04,124
What's with
your friend there?

166
00:29:04,191 --> 00:29:06,259
She's sick.

167
00:29:07,761 --> 00:29:10,430
- Actually, she never had
Mai Tais before.
- But you've had 'em.

168
00:29:10,497 --> 00:29:14,868
Oh, not tonight.
Honest.

169
00:29:14,868 --> 00:29:17,604
If you had a license,
I bet I'd have seen it by now.

170
00:29:17,671 --> 00:29:20,373
How old are you?
What?

171
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,275
Fifteen?

172
00:29:25,378 --> 00:29:29,350
Look, I'll tell you the truth.
Jannie drove us and
was supposed to drive us back.

173
00:29:29,417 --> 00:29:34,889
She has a license, but--
I mean, look at her.

174
00:29:38,058 --> 00:29:41,161
Jannie, get up.
Come on, get up!

175
00:29:41,228 --> 00:29:43,464
Getup!

176
00:30:00,081 --> 00:30:03,049
Why don't you get out?

177
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,194
Want me to walk
a straight line?

178
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,968
- I want you to bend over.
- Can I just call a cab?

179
00:30:21,035 --> 00:30:23,237
What'd I say?

180
00:30:38,854 --> 00:30:40,988
Very nice.

181
00:30:45,393 --> 00:30:48,296
Maybe I'll just ask
your friend here.

182
00:31:04,245 --> 00:31:07,381
I want you to bend over,
Officer Dutton.

183
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:12,620
What the fuck did you--
Get out of the car. Now!

184
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:14,623
Hey, punk!

185
00:31:22,498 --> 00:31:25,667
- Get your hands on the car.
- These hands?

186
00:31:25,734 --> 00:31:29,037
You're dead, ditch weed.

187
00:31:29,104 --> 00:31:31,440
Oh, my God!

188
00:31:33,942 --> 00:31:37,912
- You're up!

189
00:31:43,752 --> 00:31:47,289
Ladies, drive carefully.

190
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,862
You might want to call 9-1 -1 .

191
00:31:54,863 --> 00:31:57,266
Report an officer down.

192
00:32:04,807 --> 00:32:07,677
That was a fucking
hollow point!

193
00:32:07,744 --> 00:32:12,114
Guess it's true.
Guns don't kill people.

194
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:14,616
Think, uh,
like maybe knives do?

195
00:32:14,616 --> 00:32:17,753
Keep that thing
away from me.

196
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:23,659
Phillip, this is not
just some "thing."

197
00:32:23,727 --> 00:32:27,530
It's "AC-005."

198
00:32:29,132 --> 00:32:32,736
You're the skell that broke into
the evidence room.

199
00:32:35,071 --> 00:32:38,141
Fuck!
What do you want?

200
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:41,810
A scar
on the arm...

201
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:45,047
of the man who planted this
in Alex Corvis's car.

202
00:32:45,114 --> 00:32:49,386
There was no scar, you freak.
The Corvis kid made it up.

203
00:33:10,607 --> 00:33:14,144
He was innocent.
You killed him!

204
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:17,180
You and Erlich
and Roberts and Toomey.

205
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:20,850
What do you think,
Officer Dutton, huh?

206
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:22,886
An eye for an eye?

207
00:33:31,027 --> 00:33:34,364
- Get her!

208
00:33:42,706 --> 00:33:46,509
You were there?

209
00:33:48,145 --> 00:33:50,081
All four of you?

210
00:33:51,147 --> 00:33:53,950
You killed her!
I saw it!

211
00:33:54,017 --> 00:33:56,487
Bitch killed herself
when she shot a cop in the foot.

212
00:33:56,553 --> 00:33:59,556
If she had just shut up and acted like
a girl, nothing would have happened.

213
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:03,059
So you're right, spooky.
You happy?

214
00:34:11,535 --> 00:34:14,672
I'm working on it.

215
00:36:32,145 --> 00:36:36,682
- Police!
- Fuck! What the fuck?

216
00:36:36,748 --> 00:36:39,418
Don't do that, man.

217
00:36:39,484 --> 00:36:43,089
That's fuckin' really cool.
Thank you.

218
00:36:43,156 --> 00:36:46,625
So, how'd the month
end up?

219
00:36:46,725 --> 00:36:49,494
- Fantastic.
- Yeah.
- Never been better.

220
00:36:49,561 --> 00:36:51,598
Where's Dutton?

221
00:36:51,664 --> 00:36:55,233
Probably parked in front of
some high school with a hard-on.
The fuck never showed up.

222
00:36:57,269 --> 00:37:00,739
- You know why Dutton's not here?
- No.

223
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:04,744
Rigor mortis.
Dead!

224
00:37:04,811 --> 00:37:07,413
One shot to the head.

225
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,783
Then 53 stab wounds
with a six-inch blade.

226
00:37:12,418 --> 00:37:14,620
This cause any kind of deja vu
for you guys?

227
00:37:17,255 --> 00:37:22,694
Rumors multiply as police
refuse to confirm or deny reports
of multiple, multiple stab wounds.

228
00:37:22,762 --> 00:37:25,632
- Dad, come in here.
- Yeah, what is it, honey?

229
00:37:25,698 --> 00:37:30,403
- That cop who found
the knife in Corvis's car.
-  They're moving him now.

230
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:36,009
Body covered. It would appear
that 37-year-old Phillip Dutton
is dead in the line of duty.

231
00:37:37,076 --> 00:37:39,646
Let's go.

232
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:42,482
Watch her. What are you doing?

233
00:37:42,548 --> 00:37:47,353
Get back behind the line.
Get back there right now.

234
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,890
It's shocking,
even for these mean streets.

235
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:54,394
The word "Daisy"
carved into his forehead
by the perpetrator still at large.

236
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:57,030
A name?
Perhaps a message.

237
00:37:57,096 --> 00:38:00,266
What's the matter, honey?

238
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:03,704
Lauren used to call me that
when we were little.

239
00:38:03,771 --> 00:38:06,140
Daisy.

240
00:38:06,207 --> 00:38:08,676
Nobody knew but us.

241
00:38:08,776 --> 00:38:12,912
Honey, it doesn't mean anything.
It's not a message.

242
00:38:12,979 --> 00:38:16,015
No, that guy at the cemetery said
he knew everything about Lauren.

243
00:38:16,015 --> 00:38:18,551
It still doesn't
mean anything.

244
00:38:18,618 --> 00:38:20,787
He said he'd prove it.

245
00:38:37,403 --> 00:38:39,807
Come on,
you're hiding something!

246
00:38:39,874 --> 00:38:42,109
I don't know anything
about any knife.

247
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:46,347
- I'm tryin' to forget that case.
- Well, someone isn't.
They killed Dutton.

248
00:38:46,413 --> 00:38:49,049
- It wasn't me.
- No shit.
You couldn't get close to him.

249
00:38:49,116 --> 00:38:53,087
But I am betting...
that you know who did.

250
00:38:53,187 --> 00:38:56,390
You're the only one who gave a flying
fuck about him when he was alive.

251
00:38:56,457 --> 00:38:58,526
- Lauren Randall did.
- Yeah, well, bitches are crazy.

252
00:38:58,592 --> 00:39:01,962
The richer they are,
the crazier they get.

253
00:39:02,029 --> 00:39:05,966
Yeah? Maybe if you hadn't
fried an innocent kid--

254
00:39:08,102 --> 00:39:10,471
Who is it?
Who is it?

255
00:39:10,539 --> 00:39:12,907
Maybe it's the real killer.
Did you ever think of that? Huh?

256
00:39:15,276 --> 00:39:19,847
If you're covering up for someone,
that's jail time.
I've got my eye on you.

257
00:39:46,608 --> 00:39:49,110
Queen to bishop five.

258
00:40:00,655 --> 00:40:02,023
"Check."

259
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:17,700
Don't move.

260
00:41:38,353 --> 00:41:40,956
Fuck me.

261
00:41:49,397 --> 00:41:52,702
I heard you were looking
for this.

262
00:41:52,768 --> 00:41:54,803
You're the guy
who killed Dutton.

263
00:41:54,871 --> 00:41:57,707
The way I see it,

264
00:41:57,774 --> 00:42:01,177
I want you to think of me
as the guy who killed you.

265
00:42:01,244 --> 00:42:03,179
I'm a police officer, man!

266
00:42:03,246 --> 00:42:08,552
Yeah? What happened
to your leg there, Officer?

267
00:42:08,618 --> 00:42:11,121
Is that like
a hunting accident, huh?

268
00:42:16,292 --> 00:42:20,830
Lauren Randall shot you
trying to get free.

269
00:42:20,897 --> 00:42:24,300
The 53 stab wounds
she died of came from you!

270
00:42:24,367 --> 00:42:27,204
Am I right?
Ballpark?

271
00:42:28,438 --> 00:42:32,175
What the fuck do you want?

272
00:42:32,241 --> 00:42:38,048
I want Lauren! I want my life back!
I wanna know why!

273
00:42:38,115 --> 00:42:42,351
It's all money, man!
The girl just got in the way.

274
00:42:42,418 --> 00:42:45,755
The scar.
Which of you has it?

275
00:42:45,822 --> 00:42:50,260
Nobody. It's just a bullshit fucking
story the loser boyfriend made up.

276
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,883
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
We're gonna die!

277
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:22,920
How can you die
if you're already dead?

278
00:44:24,855 --> 00:44:28,460
You're him... Corvis.

279
00:45:39,799 --> 00:45:41,767
Go, go!
C'mon!

280
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:01,982
Here, here, take it.
Fuck!

281
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:38,018
Daisy.
How did you know?

282
00:47:38,118 --> 00:47:41,421
I told you.
I knew her.

283
00:47:41,488 --> 00:47:44,758
You killed that cop,
Dutton.

284
00:47:44,825 --> 00:47:46,994
And another one.

285
00:47:48,161 --> 00:47:50,597
Erlich.
Took a wrong turn.

286
00:47:50,664 --> 00:47:53,934
I know who you are.

287
00:47:55,669 --> 00:47:59,573
That's why
you paint your face.

288
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,576
To hide.

289
00:48:01,643 --> 00:48:03,878
I'm not hiding.

290
00:48:03,945 --> 00:48:06,013
I'm right here.

291
00:48:07,648 --> 00:48:10,083
You killed Lauren!
You killed her!

292
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:14,521
Not me! Dirty cops killed her.
Dutton and Erlich!

293
00:48:18,259 --> 00:48:22,129
My dad was right.
He said you'd ruin her life.

294
00:48:22,195 --> 00:48:24,698
No!
Listen to me!

295
00:48:24,798 --> 00:48:28,603
Lauren found out something
they didn't want her to know. This!

296
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:30,905
Look at it.

297
00:48:32,173 --> 00:48:34,142
Look at it.

298
00:48:36,377 --> 00:48:39,047
Because you need
to understand.

299
00:48:40,614 --> 00:48:44,117
You need to be careful.

300
00:48:49,691 --> 00:48:52,760
I'm sorry.

301
00:48:52,827 --> 00:48:56,564
Your father...
wasn't right.

302
00:49:29,631 --> 00:49:33,068
All right, all right!
Listen up!

303
00:49:36,604 --> 00:49:38,941
Yo!

304
00:49:40,642 --> 00:49:42,610
We've got a cop killer
out there.

305
00:49:42,677 --> 00:49:45,179
Till we get some I.D.,
treat everyone like a suspect.

306
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,016
He knows. I saw him.
He's got a fucking zombie mask.

307
00:49:48,082 --> 00:49:50,019
- Calm down.
- No, you calm down!

308
00:49:50,085 --> 00:49:54,122
Whose name's next on the fucking list,
huh? It's not yours.

309
00:49:54,188 --> 00:49:57,826
You didn't testify.
You're not on the list.

310
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:01,529
- Scary guy.
- Yeah, scary.

311
00:50:01,596 --> 00:50:04,899
He survives that crash,
takes time out for art?

312
00:50:04,966 --> 00:50:07,970
Madden, the old man's requested
the pleasure of your company.

313
00:50:10,573 --> 00:50:14,510
All right, boys and girls, to quote John
Wilkes Booth, "Just watch your backs."

314
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:28,057
- Glad I'm not you.
- Right back at ya.

315
00:50:35,631 --> 00:50:37,566
Sit down.

316
00:50:40,903 --> 00:50:43,606
I thought we had
an understanding.

317
00:50:43,672 --> 00:50:46,842
I thought we understood
that discretion is paramount.

318
00:50:46,909 --> 00:50:51,914
- Yeah, we do.
- Shut up!

319
00:50:52,014 --> 00:50:57,453
Erlich gimping around in his
goddamn hot rod is not discreet.

320
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:01,223
I've got reporters
asking me how much he made.

321
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:03,893
I've got the entire force
looking at this case now.

322
00:51:03,959 --> 00:51:06,862
- I know.
- You know.

323
00:51:06,929 --> 00:51:11,400
I know... the guy,
he leaves a sign.

324
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:15,438
No shit he leaves a sign!
He's goddamn Picasso.

325
00:51:16,705 --> 00:51:19,308
What else do you know?

326
00:51:22,478 --> 00:51:25,447
You know this?

327
00:51:30,619 --> 00:51:34,591
Tommy Leonard.
The eyewitness in the Corvis case.

328
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:38,928
Some hooker phoned it in. There was
a riot at his apartment yesterday.

329
00:51:38,994 --> 00:51:44,300
- Guy dressed for Halloween?
- Good for you. You do know something.

330
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:51,575
Don't... say.
Just do.

331
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:56,713
Before this whole thing
comes tumbling down.

332
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:16,967
- Idiots.

333
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:39,290
What are you doing?

334
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:44,195
Um, I dropped
an earring.

335
00:52:44,262 --> 00:52:48,465
Well, it looks like
you've got them both on.

336
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:02,212
Alex Corvis
didn't kill Lauren.

337
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:04,915
Cops did,
didn't they?

338
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:09,654
You're in with them.

339
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,490
- It isn't what you think.
- You killed her!

340
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:18,396
No! Erin!
It wasn't supposed to happen!

341
00:53:18,396 --> 00:53:22,834
- Stay away from me!
- Erin, please.
It wasn't supposed to happen.

342
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:26,737
- She found out.
- About you?

343
00:53:26,804 --> 00:53:29,739
About them. You have to
leave this alone, sweetheart.

344
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:31,843
Don't call me that!
Don't call me anything!

345
00:53:31,943 --> 00:53:34,512
I would never do anything
to hurt Lauren or you.

346
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:37,081
- You have to believe me.
- I don't believe you.

347
00:53:37,181 --> 00:53:41,152
- Please.
- They killed Alex because of you, Dad.

348
00:53:41,252 --> 00:53:43,187
Now you killed
both of them.

349
00:53:46,291 --> 00:53:49,694
- Please, leave him alone.
- Get your hands off me.

350
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,630
Calm down!
Put your hand down!

351
00:53:52,697 --> 00:53:56,667
- I'm not makin' this up.
He had a crow with him.
- That's what you're tellin' me.

352
00:53:56,769 --> 00:54:00,371
He said I lied at his trial.
It's Alex Corvis.

353
00:54:00,438 --> 00:54:02,908
So now we're talkin'
about a ghost...

354
00:54:03,008 --> 00:54:05,244
with a fuckin' pet bird,
is that right?

355
00:54:08,614 --> 00:54:12,383
- Turn that--
Turn that fuckin' baby down!

356
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:17,889
- I wanna show you somethin'.
See this? See this here?

357
00:54:17,889 --> 00:54:21,994
Come here. I wanna show you something,
all right? See that?

358
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:24,997
My name's next on his list.
It's fuckin' next.

359
00:54:25,063 --> 00:54:27,800
I want you to tell me
who it is, Tommy.

360
00:54:27,866 --> 00:54:31,870
- It's Corvis. It's Alex--
- Take your time.
I want you to think about it.

361
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:35,107
'Cause you gotta give me something other
than this bullshit you been spewin'.

362
00:54:35,174 --> 00:54:38,143
He said the whole trial
was a setup.

363
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:42,280
He said I caused an innocent kid
to die. Is that true?

364
00:54:42,346 --> 00:54:45,016
Is that true?

365
00:55:33,732 --> 00:55:35,667
Come on.

366
00:55:52,418 --> 00:55:55,388
Check... and mate.

367
00:55:56,589 --> 00:55:58,525
Dream on.

368
00:56:15,475 --> 00:56:19,913
Oh, my God.
That really is you under there.

369
00:56:20,013 --> 00:56:22,582
Two down.

370
00:56:22,649 --> 00:56:24,584
Two to go.

371
00:56:24,651 --> 00:56:26,586
Down?

372
00:56:28,354 --> 00:56:30,123
Wait, don't tell me.

373
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:34,494
The cops...
at my trial.

374
00:56:34,561 --> 00:56:37,564
They killed Lauren.
The whole thing was fixed.

375
00:56:37,664 --> 00:56:40,266
You think I'm crazy.

376
00:56:42,969 --> 00:56:45,138
I'm thinking...
it explains a lot.

377
00:56:45,205 --> 00:56:48,074
Lauren's father
is involved.

378
00:56:48,141 --> 00:56:52,313
He bought these cops
fancy cars.

379
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:55,815
And I don't know
what else.

380
00:56:55,882 --> 00:57:00,721
It's a company
called D-E-R-T.

381
00:57:00,788 --> 00:57:02,890
I think Lauren
found out.

382
00:57:02,957 --> 00:57:07,494
What-- What do they do
that they had to kill her?

383
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:10,397
I was hoping
you'd find out.

384
00:57:11,632 --> 00:57:13,567
I sure will.

385
00:57:22,009 --> 00:57:25,279
What's with this bird?
Keeps hangin' around.

386
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:06,020
This is where
it happened.

387
00:58:06,087 --> 00:58:08,889
Yeah, I know.

388
00:58:13,694 --> 00:58:16,130
Are you okay?

389
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:24,106
When Lauren was missing,

390
00:58:24,172 --> 00:58:27,274
the cops came
to our house.

391
00:58:27,341 --> 00:58:30,311
They said they were looking
for her, right?

392
00:58:31,479 --> 00:58:34,081
But now I know
they had her.

393
00:58:34,148 --> 00:58:36,884
And the reason
they brought her here,

394
00:58:36,952 --> 00:58:41,722
and they knew they could blame it
on you, is that I sent them here!

395
00:58:41,789 --> 00:58:45,794
I told them she came here sometimes
with her dirtball boyfriend!

396
00:58:45,894 --> 00:58:49,298
That's exactly what I said!

397
00:58:49,364 --> 00:58:53,835
Erin, it's not your fault.

398
00:58:53,935 --> 00:58:57,239
Oh, God, I wish I were dead.

399
00:58:57,306 --> 00:59:01,343
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

400
00:59:03,477 --> 00:59:05,981
There were four of them!

401
00:59:10,619 --> 00:59:15,457
- Get her out of the car.

402
00:59:15,457 --> 00:59:19,127
- C'mon, baby.
- No! No! No!

403
00:59:19,194 --> 00:59:21,263
- Hold on. C'mon, baby!
- No! No!

404
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:26,034
Be nice, would ya?
You wanna see a little somethin'?

405
00:59:26,101 --> 00:59:29,738
Four large men, and still
she grabbed one of their guns.

406
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:35,911
And she ran.
She ran for her life!

407
00:59:35,978 --> 00:59:38,413
I don't wanna know!

408
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,918
She ran, them breathing
down her neck...

409
00:59:41,985 --> 00:59:46,021
all the way
from the road...

410
00:59:46,121 --> 00:59:48,890
to here.

411
00:59:53,395 --> 00:59:55,331
Here's where it happened.

412
00:59:55,398 --> 00:59:58,368
She turned and faced them
and went down,

413
00:59:58,468 --> 01:00:01,170
kicking, and punching...

414
01:00:01,237 --> 01:00:03,973
and tearing at them
as they stabbed her.

415
01:00:05,574 --> 01:00:07,576
Fifty-three times.

416
01:00:25,962 --> 01:00:28,431
She fought
for her life...

417
01:00:28,531 --> 01:00:32,969
because life
is worth living.

418
01:00:33,069 --> 01:00:35,270
Think about that.

419
01:00:36,339 --> 01:00:38,508
Think about that.

420
01:00:38,574 --> 01:00:41,511
And you tell me how much
you wish you were dead.

421
01:00:55,992 --> 01:00:59,662
- Why wasn't this incident reported?
- Nothing to report.

422
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:02,399
All the prisoners
were present and accounted for.

423
01:01:02,466 --> 01:01:05,402
- So you pretended nothing happened?
- Hey, Corvis fried.

424
01:01:05,469 --> 01:01:07,770
I don't see how
it could've been him.

425
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:11,274
No, I wouldn't
expect you to.

426
01:01:11,341 --> 01:01:16,547
Be forewarned. Nature takes its toll.
Bon appetit.

427
01:01:25,022 --> 01:01:29,058
Okay, you lost him.
Now clear out.

428
01:01:39,202 --> 01:01:43,007
- They botched the execution.
- Yeah, you could say that.

429
01:01:43,073 --> 01:01:47,777
Christ! It was Corvis.
Tommy Leonard was right.

430
01:01:47,844 --> 01:01:49,880
Hey, babe?

431
01:01:53,116 --> 01:01:55,052
Fuckin' crow.

432
01:01:58,755 --> 01:02:01,191
Sign of the dead
come back to life.

433
01:02:01,257 --> 01:02:03,694
How about sign of
a big black bird?

434
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:07,531
The dead can return
given sufficient motivation.

435
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:09,533
And Corvis has that.

436
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:14,972
I've studied this phenomenon before.
He's looking for something.

437
01:02:14,972 --> 01:02:17,675
Won't stop
till he finds it.

438
01:02:17,741 --> 01:02:23,448
Sometimes, the best way
to get rid of someone is...
to let them have what they want.

439
01:02:23,514 --> 01:02:26,218
The man with the scar.

440
01:02:28,285 --> 01:02:32,723
Give him the man with
the scar, then he'll lose his powers.

441
01:02:32,823 --> 01:02:36,293
The man with the scar...

442
01:02:36,393 --> 01:02:38,829
took everything
I ever cared about.

443
01:02:38,896 --> 01:02:42,834
Left me with nothing.

444
01:02:42,901 --> 01:02:45,736
So you're going
to kill him?

445
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:48,240
I have to find him first.

446
01:02:50,342 --> 01:02:55,446
You know what Lauren and I
were fighting about that night?

447
01:02:55,512 --> 01:02:57,948
She had a secret.

448
01:02:58,015 --> 01:02:59,850
Wouldn't tell me.

449
01:03:02,453 --> 01:03:04,589
My father.

450
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:08,092
All I knew was
she was pulling away.

451
01:03:08,192 --> 01:03:10,128
It made me crazy.

452
01:03:10,195 --> 01:03:14,298
I used to be
so proud of him.

453
01:03:14,298 --> 01:03:17,802
My big-deal daddy.

454
01:03:17,903 --> 01:03:22,741
And now...
he's just a crook.

455
01:03:22,807 --> 01:03:25,777
Worse even.

456
01:03:25,844 --> 01:03:29,014
And the weird thing is...

457
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,917
I wish I could hate him,

458
01:03:31,983 --> 01:03:34,452
but I can't.

459
01:03:34,553 --> 01:03:36,988
He said he'd never hurt
either of us.

460
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:40,458
And I know it's true.

461
01:03:43,628 --> 01:03:46,097
And I'm going back.

462
01:03:49,668 --> 01:03:51,836
It's what Lauren
would do.

463
01:03:51,903 --> 01:03:54,139
I wanna forget.

464
01:03:55,607 --> 01:03:58,243
Forget everything.

465
01:04:03,915 --> 01:04:05,885
Keep it.

466
01:04:05,985 --> 01:04:08,888
It connects you to Lauren.

467
01:04:11,157 --> 01:04:14,026
And it connects you to me.

468
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:28,874
No matter what happens,

469
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:33,112
I'll make sure everyone knows
that you're innocent.

470
01:04:34,212 --> 01:04:36,349
That you loved her.

471
01:04:38,851 --> 01:04:41,854
If you need me,
you know where to find me.

472
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:55,601
- You know it doesn't work this way.
- I'm out of this, John.

473
01:04:57,970 --> 01:05:00,940
Partner ships
don't end like that.

474
01:05:01,007 --> 01:05:03,176
Friendships don't.

475
01:05:03,242 --> 01:05:07,880
Our friendship...
ended when Lauren died.

476
01:05:07,947 --> 01:05:11,884
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan?

477
01:05:11,984 --> 01:05:15,955
- Because there's a ghost
threatening us.
- You mean Alex.

478
01:05:17,623 --> 01:05:19,559
I mean Lauren.

479
01:05:19,625 --> 01:05:24,597
Because you never accepted that
what happened to her was an accident.

480
01:05:24,697 --> 01:05:27,166
Your men
killed my daughter.

481
01:05:27,233 --> 01:05:32,139
- An accident, Nathan.
- She was 1 8 years old.

482
01:05:32,206 --> 01:05:37,644
There were four of them.
They stabbed her 53 times.

483
01:05:37,744 --> 01:05:42,281
Where's the accident, John?
Where's the fucking accident?

484
01:05:42,381 --> 01:05:47,019
I watched her grow up,
just like you.

485
01:05:47,086 --> 01:05:50,691
I know how her mind worked.

486
01:05:50,757 --> 01:05:53,961
She was snooping around
because she was worried about you,

487
01:05:54,027 --> 01:05:56,964
about what you'd
gotten yourself into.

488
01:05:57,030 --> 01:06:01,869
So stop blaming me...
and blame yourself.

489
01:06:01,935 --> 01:06:05,672
I do... every day.

490
01:06:05,739 --> 01:06:07,941
Erin knows,
doesn't she?

491
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:12,179
Don't bother.
You never were a good liar.

492
01:06:15,616 --> 01:06:17,550
Look at this.

493
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:22,022
Everything we've worked for.

494
01:06:24,124 --> 01:06:29,329
Now, you tell me.
What are we going to do?

495
01:06:40,107 --> 01:06:43,610
Dad? You home?

496
01:07:59,521 --> 01:08:03,992
D-E-R-T is owned
by Westwind Builders,

497
01:08:04,092 --> 01:08:06,027
Nathan Randall's company.

498
01:08:06,094 --> 01:08:11,533
But DERT, in turn, owns
a dozen other corporations.

499
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:16,472
That's a big mess to wade through,
so I checked out Tommy Leonard.

500
01:08:16,472 --> 01:08:20,642
Leonard, Dutton, Erlich.
They don't matter.

501
01:08:20,708 --> 01:08:22,644
You understand?

502
01:08:23,812 --> 01:08:25,380
I want the king.

503
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:30,718
We're getting there because,
in his so-called construction job,

504
01:08:30,785 --> 01:08:34,489
Tommy makes a daily delivery
to a place called The Key Club.

505
01:08:34,556 --> 01:08:39,027
- The strip joint?
- I believe they call it
a connoisseur's club.

506
01:08:39,127 --> 01:08:42,163
Owned by DERT.

507
01:08:42,263 --> 01:08:45,100
Places like this,
they're about unreported cash,

508
01:08:45,166 --> 01:08:48,871
processing money from drugs,
prostitution.

509
01:08:48,938 --> 01:08:51,106
So I took a chance.
I called over there,

510
01:08:51,173 --> 01:08:54,243
asking for Roberts and Toomey,
the two other cops.

511
01:08:54,343 --> 01:08:59,047
Whoever answered said, "They're not
here. This is the front office."

512
01:09:02,718 --> 01:09:04,887
They killed my dad.

513
01:09:08,758 --> 01:09:11,193
I can't take it.

514
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:13,863
Erin?

515
01:09:13,929 --> 01:09:16,599
Erin? Who?

516
01:09:16,599 --> 01:09:19,402
I don't know.
I found him lying there.

517
01:09:19,468 --> 01:09:23,371
Where is it, this place?

518
01:09:23,438 --> 01:09:26,942
- I think we should get some support.
- What, call the police?

519
01:09:27,043 --> 01:09:30,212
What is this?
Where are you going?

520
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:32,214
1 31 5 Berkeley Street.

521
01:10:02,745 --> 01:10:06,182
Hey, you have some I.D., pal?
Circus in town, or what?

522
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:44,554
How old are you?

523
01:10:44,621 --> 01:10:47,891
You have one chance
to value your life.

524
01:10:47,958 --> 01:10:50,160
Take it.

525
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,236
We'll be safe in my car.
Nobody will recognize it.

526
01:10:59,302 --> 01:11:01,938
We'll put yours in back.

527
01:11:02,005 --> 01:11:04,474
You followed me here.

528
01:11:04,574 --> 01:11:07,377
No.

529
01:11:07,444 --> 01:11:12,649
Erin, I put a bulletin out
on your car because...

530
01:11:12,716 --> 01:11:16,286
there's bad news, and I thought
you should hear it from me.

531
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:21,024
Your father got involved
with some bad cops on my force.

532
01:11:21,091 --> 01:11:25,296
So I take responsibility.
He killed himself.

533
01:11:26,897 --> 01:11:28,832
How?

534
01:11:28,899 --> 01:11:32,269
How'd he kill himself?
With a gun.

535
01:11:32,336 --> 01:11:37,207
With a gun, right? When there wasn't
one anywhere near where you found him!

536
01:11:39,344 --> 01:11:41,312
- You killed him.
- Erin, don't.

537
01:11:41,412 --> 01:11:44,082
- Back the fuck off now!
- He left this.

538
01:11:44,148 --> 01:11:47,118
There's names, addresses.
There's a note to you.

539
01:11:47,185 --> 01:11:51,689
These people he got involved with,
they killed Lauren.
He couldn't bear it anymore.

540
01:11:51,789 --> 01:11:56,760
Oh, my God, he's right.
It's all here.

541
01:11:56,860 --> 01:11:58,996
The note.
Show it to me.

542
01:11:59,062 --> 01:12:01,532
Not you!
Show it to me.

543
01:12:02,934 --> 01:12:05,002
It's right here.
Look, under here.

544
01:12:05,103 --> 01:12:06,738
Look.

545
01:12:20,318 --> 01:12:22,253
You need help?

546
01:12:23,888 --> 01:12:26,824
Finish him.

547
01:13:26,218 --> 01:13:30,122
Lauren?
You were here?

548
01:13:39,598 --> 01:13:41,800
Hey. Hey, c'mon. Wake up. Wake up.

549
01:13:41,866 --> 01:13:45,771
Hey. Come on, Sampson,
wake up. Come on.

550
01:13:47,573 --> 01:13:52,278
You awake, Sampson?
You awake?

551
01:13:53,812 --> 01:13:57,416
Not anymore.

552
01:13:57,483 --> 01:14:00,686
Shit. That's Randall's daughter.
She saw us.

553
01:14:00,753 --> 01:14:02,655
Go, go, go!
Get her!

554
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:27,079
Gentlemen.

555
01:14:50,604 --> 01:14:52,305
Cheers.

556
01:15:01,781 --> 01:15:04,251
Find him!

557
01:15:04,317 --> 01:15:06,853
Go.

558
01:16:00,508 --> 01:16:02,810
Toomey!

559
01:16:36,511 --> 01:16:41,482
Spark, gas.
Bad combination.

560
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:47,722
And it's not this leak here that's
the least of your worries, ya know?

561
01:16:53,328 --> 01:16:57,832
You're him.
Jesus, you're Corvis!

562
01:16:57,932 --> 01:17:00,968
We fried your ass!
You're a dead man!

563
01:17:01,068 --> 01:17:05,840
- Good thing, in a situation like this.
- You're a fuckin' zombie.

564
01:17:05,907 --> 01:17:07,708
Son of a bitch.

565
01:17:07,775 --> 01:17:10,678
- The scar!
- There is no scar!

566
01:18:00,129 --> 01:18:02,064
It's over.

567
01:18:22,951 --> 01:18:24,921
I'm losing you.

568
01:18:27,256 --> 01:18:30,225
Come on, Alex.

569
01:18:30,293 --> 01:18:33,630
Lauren?

570
01:18:39,535 --> 01:18:42,638
What'd you do that for?
He's bleeding.

571
01:18:42,738 --> 01:18:45,240
I don't--
I don't bleed.

572
01:19:11,067 --> 01:19:13,603
Erin?

573
01:19:51,342 --> 01:19:53,309
The king.

574
01:20:41,425 --> 01:20:44,361
I hate that picture.

575
01:20:44,427 --> 01:20:46,664
Where is she?

576
01:20:46,731 --> 01:20:48,899
Can I get you something?

577
01:20:48,966 --> 01:20:51,502
Glass of water?
Transfusion?

578
01:20:51,602 --> 01:20:54,505
Last chance.

579
01:20:54,572 --> 01:20:56,507
Where's Erin?

580
01:20:56,574 --> 01:20:59,944
Or what? You'll bleed
all over my carpet?

581
01:21:00,010 --> 01:21:02,780
You know,

582
01:21:02,847 --> 01:21:06,384
crime was actually down
before you showed up.

583
01:21:06,484 --> 01:21:08,452
Or, uh,

584
01:21:08,519 --> 01:21:12,723
stuck around, or whatever the hell
you're doing here.

585
01:21:12,790 --> 01:21:15,326
What are you doing here?

586
01:21:15,359 --> 01:21:17,629
I'm looking for my friend.

587
01:21:17,696 --> 01:21:22,133
See, I heard you were looking
for some guy with a scar.

588
01:21:22,199 --> 01:21:24,935
How's that going?
Did you find him?

589
01:21:25,002 --> 01:21:28,939
Yes? No?

590
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:32,476
You're like the guest
who would not leave.

591
01:21:32,576 --> 01:21:36,948
And, judging by your condition,
maybe you've overstayed your welcome.

592
01:21:37,015 --> 01:21:40,918
It's not a criticism,
it's just an observation.

593
01:21:40,985 --> 01:21:44,356
Oh.

594
01:21:44,423 --> 01:21:48,392
I don't think you're gonna use it.
That's Lauren's knife.

595
01:21:50,896 --> 01:21:55,467
You come in here so full of righteous
indignation. What have you got to be...

596
01:21:55,567 --> 01:21:57,736
so righteous about,
huh?

597
01:21:57,803 --> 01:22:00,605
How many innocent people
did you leave dead back there?

598
01:22:00,672 --> 01:22:02,606
I had no choice.
You sent them.

599
01:22:02,673 --> 01:22:07,479
Bullshit! You're a killer,
that's all you are.

600
01:22:07,546 --> 01:22:11,148
Just a clown with a bird
and a rising death toll.

601
01:22:11,249 --> 01:22:13,251
You think the world
did you wrong? Huh?

602
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:15,754
You did the world wrong.

603
01:22:15,754 --> 01:22:19,691
You and Lauren had a fight,
and you couldn't let it go.

604
01:22:27,733 --> 01:22:31,470
- What is your problem?

605
01:22:31,536 --> 01:22:34,706
- Why won't you tell me?
- I can't tell you!

606
01:22:34,773 --> 01:22:37,743
I just--
I just can't. I--

607
01:22:37,843 --> 01:22:40,947
- Come back here! Come here!
- No! Stop!

608
01:22:42,547 --> 01:22:46,118
It was bad enough her dad
rejected you, but when she did...

609
01:22:46,219 --> 01:22:49,389
-you lost it.
- You're wrong.

610
01:22:49,455 --> 01:22:53,158
Yeah? Well, I see doubt
oozing out all over you.

611
01:22:53,225 --> 01:22:55,694
Where do people go
who kill their girlfriends?

612
01:22:55,794 --> 01:22:58,497
- Screwed-up kid.
-

613
01:22:58,563 --> 01:23:01,900
He stabbed her 53 times.
Where will he end up?

614
01:23:07,139 --> 01:23:10,843
Take a look, you sick fuck!
That's who you are.

615
01:23:10,910 --> 01:23:13,579
Are you looking?

616
01:23:13,646 --> 01:23:16,649
Every loser name anybody
ever called you is true.

617
01:23:16,683 --> 01:23:19,085
- Are you looking?

618
01:23:23,789 --> 01:23:26,158
I never meant to hurt her.

619
01:23:26,224 --> 01:23:28,294
You see it?

620
01:23:28,394 --> 01:23:34,132
Alexander Frederick Corvis,
do you have any last words?

621
01:23:34,199 --> 01:23:36,402
I loved Lauren.

622
01:23:37,770 --> 01:23:40,206
I never meant
to hurt her.

623
01:23:40,273 --> 01:23:42,809
Did you see it?

624
01:23:44,010 --> 01:23:45,945
Did you see it?

625
01:23:47,513 --> 01:23:51,517
Yeah, I think
you fuckin' saw it.

626
01:23:56,689 --> 01:24:02,095
Lucky, huh? I guess
he found the arm you planted.

627
01:24:02,161 --> 01:24:05,798
A fake picture's worth
a thousand words, huh?

628
01:24:05,865 --> 01:24:08,134
Just don't believe
everything you see.

629
01:24:08,201 --> 01:24:10,203
Doubt is a motherfucker.

630
01:24:10,303 --> 01:24:13,539
Give me a hand
with this sack of shit.

631
01:24:15,209 --> 01:24:17,410
Oh, he's cute!

632
01:24:17,477 --> 01:24:19,879
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Was cute.

633
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:28,554
All but the face.

634
01:24:28,622 --> 01:24:31,325
Well, makeup
can work for you...

635
01:24:31,392 --> 01:24:33,826
or against you,
right?

636
01:24:33,893 --> 01:24:36,229
All done.

637
01:24:36,296 --> 01:24:38,231
Very nice.

638
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:45,739
- You're such a good listener.
-  Clear the table.

639
01:24:51,645 --> 01:24:54,947
I've read about this,
but I never thought I'd see it.

640
01:24:55,014 --> 01:24:59,453
So, was he alive
or dead?

641
01:24:59,553 --> 01:25:02,456
I've seen birds stuffed
and mounted so lifelike...

642
01:25:02,523 --> 01:25:04,491
you'd swear
you saw them breathing.

643
01:25:04,558 --> 01:25:08,429
Yeah, maybe we've got a case
of that here. Get me my kit.

644
01:25:12,666 --> 01:25:16,903
The two of you are majorly demented.
You know that?

645
01:25:16,903 --> 01:25:21,842
He should've gone home when he found the
scar we planted. He came to save her.

646
01:25:21,942 --> 01:25:25,512
Caring for the living.
Not part of his job description.

647
01:25:31,585 --> 01:25:34,655
- Fifty-three?
- In all the excitement,
I guess I lost count.

648
01:25:37,791 --> 01:25:42,129
Think I'll mount him
with his head up his ass.

649
01:25:49,136 --> 01:25:51,205
- Grab it!

650
01:26:10,824 --> 01:26:12,893
And it connects you to me.

651
01:26:14,963 --> 01:26:17,933
No matter what happens,

652
01:26:18,032 --> 01:26:21,702
I'll make sure
everyone knows...

653
01:26:21,770 --> 01:26:23,704
that you're innocent.

654
01:26:26,573 --> 01:26:30,679
I promise.

655
01:26:47,329 --> 01:26:51,466
Everything you ever showed me,
all lies.

656
01:26:53,802 --> 01:26:57,572
- I'll kill her.
- No!

657
01:26:57,639 --> 01:26:59,741
Oh, I'd love to hurt ya!

658
01:27:19,028 --> 01:27:21,597
- Got you!

659
01:27:23,966 --> 01:27:26,402
That bird!
Kill it!

660
01:28:18,354 --> 01:28:20,290
You brought him back.

661
01:28:20,356 --> 01:28:23,626
Good.
He owes you.

662
01:28:35,171 --> 01:28:37,139
Where did they go?

663
01:30:45,269 --> 01:30:48,840
- I know you too well. You won't do it.
- You don't know me at all.

664
01:30:48,940 --> 01:30:51,409
Aah! God!

665
01:30:54,179 --> 01:30:58,450
There's only one in the chamber.
That's all you get.

666
01:31:00,618 --> 01:31:03,188
Holy mother of God!

667
01:31:09,427 --> 01:31:11,396
The devil himself.

668
01:31:33,918 --> 01:31:36,521
What the fuck?

669
01:32:04,650 --> 01:32:07,820
The jolt,

670
01:32:07,887 --> 01:32:12,058
eight amps
at 2,000 to 3,000 volts.

671
01:32:12,124 --> 01:32:15,861
It lasts a few seconds.

672
01:32:15,861 --> 01:32:19,631
The current surges
and is turned off.

673
01:32:19,697 --> 01:32:22,935
Then they check to see
if the heart is still beating.

674
01:32:23,002 --> 01:32:24,937
If it is... ba-boom!

675
01:32:25,003 --> 01:32:28,974
Another jolt is applied.

676
01:32:31,744 --> 01:32:33,946
Experts say
unconsciousness...

677
01:32:34,013 --> 01:32:38,918
occurs before pain
has time to register.

678
01:32:38,984 --> 01:32:41,320
They agree
that electrocution...

679
01:32:41,387 --> 01:32:44,391
does not hurt.

680
01:32:44,490 --> 01:32:46,960
But it does.

681
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:51,397
Unimaginably...
believe me.

682
01:32:54,133 --> 01:32:58,138
I... don't expect a call
from the governor.

683
01:32:59,905 --> 01:33:03,443
Any last words...
Captain?

684
01:33:06,179 --> 01:33:08,582
Yeah.
Fuck you!

685
01:33:14,554 --> 01:33:16,422
Was that it?

686
01:33:17,857 --> 01:33:20,693
I'm not dying for your goddamn
illusions! You got that?

687
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:26,198
You think you and your girl friend
had some rosy future taken
from you? Bullshit!

688
01:33:26,298 --> 01:33:29,535
She was already bored. Why do
you think she was lookin' around?

689
01:33:29,602 --> 01:33:32,171
You're nothing, Corvis.
Less than nothing!

690
01:33:34,007 --> 01:33:36,576
You can't do this to me,
you little fucks!

691
01:33:37,843 --> 01:33:40,881
You hear me?
You understand?

692
01:33:40,981 --> 01:33:43,215
I'll be back!

693
01:33:43,282 --> 01:33:47,354
Just like you! A big,
fucking, shit-spewing bird!

694
01:33:47,454 --> 01:33:50,023
And guess which little bitch
I'm taking out first!

695
01:33:50,123 --> 01:33:53,026
You are so dead.

696
01:34:43,077 --> 01:34:45,011
Erin?

697
01:34:47,414 --> 01:34:51,052
I'll always be with you,
and so will Lauren.

698
01:34:51,152 --> 01:34:54,255
Alex, look.

699
01:35:21,516 --> 01:35:26,788
In that moment, when
Alex went, I knew I was making a choice.

700
01:35:26,854 --> 01:35:29,791
To be alive in the world.

701
01:35:29,857 --> 01:35:32,527
I'm thinking of them...

702
01:35:32,593 --> 01:35:37,332
hoping that sometimes
they're thinking of me.
