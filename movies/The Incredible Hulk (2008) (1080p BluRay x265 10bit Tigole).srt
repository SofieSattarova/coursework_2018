1
00:04:02,426 --> 00:04:03,802
Is it ready?

2
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:20,903
Hey! That's a great punch.

3
00:05:05,155 --> 00:05:09,159
Fear no good.
So emotion and control.

4
00:05:33,308 --> 00:05:34,977
Breathe. Breathe.

5
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:44,403
Wait.

6
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:56,183
Okay.

7
00:07:01,313 --> 00:07:04,441
I can make it work for a while,
but you need...

8
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:13,700
Okay. Okay.

9
00:07:30,342 --> 00:07:32,469
Shut that off! Turn it off!

10
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:37,516
Watch out!

11
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,756
Okay!

12
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,177
That's not right.

13
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,286
Oh, you.

14
00:10:12,963 --> 00:10:16,633
You see that? See that?
My ticket out of here.

15
00:11:51,561 --> 00:11:52,813
Damn it!

16
00:12:56,918 --> 00:12:58,545
Here's something
a bit more interesting.

17
00:12:59,421 --> 00:13:01,965
It's a possible gamma sickness. Milwaukee.

18
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:07,012
A man drank one of those guarana sodas.

19
00:13:07,971 --> 00:13:11,558
Guess it had a little more kick
than he was looking for.

20
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:13,894
Wow.

21
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:20,275
- Where was it bottled?
- Porto Verde, Brazil.

22
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:24,154
Have our people look for a white man
at the bottling plant.

23
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:27,657
Tell them no contact!
If he even sees them, he's gone!

24
00:13:49,012 --> 00:13:51,848
I got you who I could.
Short notice, but they're all quality.

25
00:13:52,557 --> 00:13:53,934
And I pulled you one ace.

26
00:13:59,064 --> 00:14:03,360
Emil Blonsky.
Born in Russia, raised in England.

27
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:06,237
And on loan to SOCOM
from the Royal Marines.

28
00:14:12,035 --> 00:14:14,537
I know you
cashed in some chips for this, Joe.

29
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:17,582
Glad I could help. Just make it good.

30
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:30,804
This is the target and the location.
Snatch and grab, live capture.

31
00:14:30,887 --> 00:14:32,806
You'll have your dart clips
and suppression ordnance,

32
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:35,225
but live fire is for backup only.

33
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,936
We got local out there,
but we want it tight and quiet.

34
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:39,646
Is he a fighter?

35
00:14:40,438 --> 00:14:43,984
Your target is a fugitive
from the US government

36
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:46,319
who stole military secrets.

37
00:14:46,403 --> 00:14:50,991
He is also implicated
in the deaths of two scientists,

38
00:14:51,074 --> 00:14:54,911
a military officer, an Idaho state trooper
and possibly two Canadian hunters.

39
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:58,081
So don't wait to see if he's a fighter!

40
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:01,001
Tranq him and bring him back.

41
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:44,127
Oh, come on.

42
00:16:47,357 --> 00:16:48,358
Camera.

43
00:16:51,027 --> 00:16:52,112
Here we go.

44
00:17:04,874 --> 00:17:06,334
Get rid of the damn dog.

45
00:17:18,221 --> 00:17:19,222
Take him!

46
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:32,819
Target's on the move.

47
00:17:41,411 --> 00:17:42,453
Where is he?

48
00:17:48,918 --> 00:17:50,170
He's on the ground.

49
00:17:50,253 --> 00:17:52,005
- Let's go!
- Go!

50
00:17:53,923 --> 00:17:54,924
Move, move!

51
00:18:16,487 --> 00:18:18,114
Go, go, go!

52
00:18:19,574 --> 00:18:21,075
GO! Go!

53
00:18:23,953 --> 00:18:25,705
Clear everyone out!

54
00:18:26,956 --> 00:18:28,124
Do not lose him!

55
00:19:13,378 --> 00:19:15,213
Oh! No!

56
00:20:26,951 --> 00:20:28,119
Get around behind him!

57
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:32,290
Target moving past mobile unit 0-9-0.

58
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:48,181
Oh, no.

59
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,434
You got to be kidding me.

60
00:21:22,006 --> 00:21:24,300
- Where is he?
- Target acquired.

61
00:21:37,146 --> 00:21:38,314
Gringo!

62
00:21:54,664 --> 00:21:55,665
Let's go.

63
00:22:09,512 --> 00:22:10,513
No!

64
00:22:11,514 --> 00:22:12,932
Please! No!

65
00:22:15,184 --> 00:22:16,811
Not the computer!

66
00:22:16,978 --> 00:22:18,396
Gimme that! No!

67
00:22:35,872 --> 00:22:40,168
You bad angry, G?
I very bad angry.

68
00:22:44,005 --> 00:22:45,047
Oh, no.

69
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:48,926
You don't understand! Something really bad
is about to happen here!

70
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:10,031
Anybody else seeing this?

71
00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:45,024
We've got a bogey
of some kind. Please advise.

72
00:23:45,107 --> 00:23:48,110
That is the target!
Use every tranq you've got!

73
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:49,695
Do it now!

74
00:23:57,328 --> 00:23:59,830
Go live! Go live! Go live!

75
00:23:59,914 --> 00:24:01,707
- Move!
- Get out of the way!

76
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:03,376
No!

77
00:24:36,033 --> 00:24:38,494
It's behind us! Move! Move!

78
00:24:47,128 --> 00:24:48,379
Get him!

79
00:24:50,006 --> 00:24:51,215
Shoot!

80
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,190
Leave me alone.

81
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,721
No! No!

82
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:35,653
I knew something was different
before I got the shot off.

83
00:26:35,736 --> 00:26:38,114
He had it on him when he bolted.

84
00:26:44,286 --> 00:26:47,540
Is that a girlfriend? She helps him, maybe?

85
00:26:50,584 --> 00:26:53,421
She is no longer a factor.

86
00:26:53,504 --> 00:26:56,966
We closed that door to him a long time ago.
He's alone.

87
00:26:57,049 --> 00:27:01,137
He wants to be alone.
But see if he's been talking to anybody.

88
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:10,521
Forgive me, sir?

89
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:15,025
Doesn't anybody want to talk
about what went down in there? 'Cause...

90
00:27:16,485 --> 00:27:17,862
He didn't lose us.

91
00:27:17,945 --> 00:27:21,741
And he was not alone, sir. We had him.

92
00:27:21,824 --> 00:27:24,160
And then something hit us, something...

93
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:27,079
Something big hit us!

94
00:27:29,123 --> 00:27:32,376
It threw a forklift truck like it was a softball!

95
00:27:34,462 --> 00:27:38,048
It was the most powerful thing
I've ever seen.

96
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:40,551
Well, it's gone.

97
00:27:42,845 --> 00:27:44,555
Well, if Banner knows what it is,

98
00:27:44,638 --> 00:27:47,767
I'm gonna track him down,
I'm gonna put my foot on his throat

99
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,685
-and I'm gonna...
- That was Banner.

100
00:27:54,523 --> 00:27:55,691
It

101
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,694
was Banner.

102
00:27:59,028 --> 00:28:03,032
- You have to explain that statement, sir.
- No, I don't.

103
00:28:05,534 --> 00:28:07,286
You've done a good job.

104
00:28:08,704 --> 00:28:12,917
Pack up and get our men on a plane.
We're going home.

105
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:18,482
Wait.

106
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:22,444
Please.

107
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,078
Where am I?

108
00:30:06,614 --> 00:30:09,658
I've run into bad situations
on crap missions before.

109
00:30:09,742 --> 00:30:10,868
I've seen good men go down

110
00:30:10,951 --> 00:30:14,204
purely because someone didn't let us know
what we were walking into.

111
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:16,665
I've moved on to the next one,
because that's what we do, right?

112
00:30:16,749 --> 00:30:18,125
I mean, that's the job.

113
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:19,418
But this?

114
00:30:21,337 --> 00:30:24,089
This is a whole new level of weird.

115
00:30:24,173 --> 00:30:27,051
And I don't feel inclined
to step away from it.

116
00:30:27,134 --> 00:30:30,179
So if you're taking another crack at him,
I want in.

117
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:34,099
And, with respect, you should be looking
for a team that's prepped and ready to fight,

118
00:30:34,183 --> 00:30:36,310
because if that thing shows up again,

119
00:30:37,394 --> 00:30:41,065
you're gonna have a lot of professional
tough guys pissing in their pants.

120
00:30:42,024 --> 00:30:43,025
Sir.

121
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:35,160
Tienes más stretchy?

122
00:31:36,912 --> 00:31:39,248
Yeah. Perfecto.

123
00:32:10,446 --> 00:32:12,698
Let me emphasize
that what I'm about to share with you

124
00:32:12,781 --> 00:32:16,118
is tremendously sensitive,
both to me personally and the Army.

125
00:32:18,954 --> 00:32:22,166
You're aware that we've got an
Infantry Weapons Development program.

126
00:32:22,249 --> 00:32:26,879
Well, in WWII, they initiated a subprogram

127
00:32:26,962 --> 00:32:29,548
for Bio-Tech Force Enhancement.

128
00:32:29,631 --> 00:32:31,467
Yeah, Super Soldier.

129
00:32:33,927 --> 00:32:34,970
Yes.

130
00:32:35,888 --> 00:32:38,098
An oversimplification, but yes.

131
00:32:38,932 --> 00:32:42,811
And I dusted it off, got 'em doing
serious work again, bold work.

132
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:45,606
Across the hall,
they were trying to arm you better.

133
00:32:45,689 --> 00:32:47,941
We were tryin' to make you better.

134
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:56,658
Banner's work was very early phase.
It wasn't even weapons application.

135
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:59,328
He thought he was working
on radiation resistance.

136
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:02,706
I would never have told him
what the project really was.

137
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:07,336
But he was so sure of what he was onto,
that he tested it on himself.

138
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:10,214
And something went very wrong.

139
00:33:12,674 --> 00:33:14,593
Or it went very right.

140
00:33:15,385 --> 00:33:19,473
As far as I'm concerned, that man's
whole body is the property of the US Army.

141
00:33:19,556 --> 00:33:22,518
You said he wasn't working
on weapons, right?

142
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:24,770
- No.
- But you were. You were, weren't you?

143
00:33:24,853 --> 00:33:26,814
You were trying other things.

144
00:33:26,897 --> 00:33:29,817
One serum we developed

145
00:33:31,026 --> 00:33:32,361
was very promising.

146
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:35,072
- So why did he run?
- He's a scientist.

147
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:38,325
He is not one of us.

148
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:45,707
- Blonsky, how old are you? 45?
-39.

149
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,087
- It takes a toll, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.

150
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,463
So get out of the trenches.

151
00:33:51,547 --> 00:33:53,966
You should be a Colonel by now,
with your record.

152
00:33:54,049 --> 00:33:58,303
No, I'm a fighter.
I'll be one for as long as I can.

153
00:33:58,387 --> 00:34:01,598
You know, if I could take what I know now,
put it in the body I had ten years ago,

154
00:34:01,682 --> 00:34:04,434
that would be someone
I wouldn't want to fight.

155
00:34:06,395 --> 00:34:09,356
I could probably arrange
something like that.

156
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,207
Take care, kids.

157
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:44,970
Stan, I give you my word,

158
00:36:45,053 --> 00:36:46,805
whatever you've heard about me,
it's not true.

159
00:36:46,888 --> 00:36:50,017
Oh, I know it. I always knew it.

160
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,894
I mean, you know how I felt about you two.

161
00:36:55,856 --> 00:36:58,692
- Have you talked to her?
- No.

162
00:36:58,775 --> 00:37:01,069
She doesn't know that I'm here.

163
00:37:02,904 --> 00:37:07,200
- She's with somebody?
- Yeah, he's a head shrink.

164
00:37:07,284 --> 00:37:10,746
They say he's one of the best.
But a really nice guy.

165
00:37:13,874 --> 00:37:15,667
Good. That's good.

166
00:37:15,751 --> 00:37:20,547
- Bruce, what can I do to help you?
- I could use a bed for a few nights.

167
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:24,551
- You can have the spare room upstairs.
- That'd be so great.

168
00:37:26,261 --> 00:37:28,597
There is one other thing.

169
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:34,436
Excuse me. Pardon me.

170
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:37,522
Coming through.

171
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:44,071
Hey, pal. I got a delivery on five.

172
00:37:44,946 --> 00:37:46,406
I don't think there's anybody up there.

173
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:50,994
Oh, man. I'm gonna catch hell
if I don't collect. You got to let me try.

174
00:37:52,954 --> 00:37:56,541
I'll tell you what. I got an extra medium.
Take it on the house.

175
00:38:03,423 --> 00:38:06,593
- You are the man.
- God bless you, brother.

176
00:38:09,137 --> 00:38:10,263
All right.

177
00:39:07,988 --> 00:39:09,114
Okay.

178
00:40:22,604 --> 00:40:25,023
We're pretty well closed here, folks.
I'm sorry.

179
00:40:25,106 --> 00:40:27,526
Oh, come on, Stan. It's Friday night.

180
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:30,403
Oh, kids.

181
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,031
I got nothing but marinara now.

182
00:40:33,114 --> 00:40:35,200
Oh, I got to have a Mister Pink, please.

183
00:40:35,283 --> 00:40:37,494
She worked through dinner again,
of course.

184
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:46,336
Stan?

185
00:40:47,754 --> 00:40:52,050
And he... I go, "So, yeah,
I mean, where were you?

186
00:40:52,133 --> 00:40:54,219
"I can't... I don't know
where you were, Cecil."

187
00:40:54,302 --> 00:40:56,763
And he goes, "Not where you been at."

188
00:40:56,846 --> 00:41:00,600
I thought, "Oh, my God." I just felt so awful.

189
00:41:28,169 --> 00:41:29,546
Bruce?

190
00:41:36,177 --> 00:41:39,180
Betty? What's going on?

191
00:41:54,529 --> 00:41:55,655
Betty...

192
00:41:55,739 --> 00:41:58,867
Just tell me if I saw what I think I saw.

193
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:03,872
- I don't know what to say.
- Please, just tell me the truth.

194
00:42:45,246 --> 00:42:47,832
Don't go. Don't go.

195
00:42:57,676 --> 00:42:59,636
I want you to come with me now.

196
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:01,930
Please. Come with me.

197
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:04,599
Please.

198
00:43:34,754 --> 00:43:36,297
It's our data.

199
00:43:37,215 --> 00:43:40,260
I got in there before they carted it all away.

200
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:46,141
I hoped somewhere that it might tell us
something someday.

201
00:43:48,476 --> 00:43:53,148
- Does the General know that you have this?
- No, I don't think so.

202
00:43:53,231 --> 00:43:55,567
I haven't spoken to him in a couple of years.

203
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:57,152
You have to be sure.

204
00:43:57,235 --> 00:44:02,365
Bruce, I don't understand why we can't
just go in there together and talk to him.

205
00:44:02,449 --> 00:44:07,328
He told me what he wanted to do.
He wants it out of me.

206
00:44:07,412 --> 00:44:10,665
He wants to dissect it
so that he can replicate it.

207
00:44:10,749 --> 00:44:12,959
He wants to make it a weapon.

208
00:45:04,886 --> 00:45:06,221
- Hi.
- Hi.

209
00:45:07,347 --> 00:45:11,226
- I thought you might want to...
- Thanks.

210
00:45:13,102 --> 00:45:16,689
Listen, I should leave early,
as early as I can.

211
00:45:16,773 --> 00:45:20,193
Really? You can't stay at all?

212
00:45:20,276 --> 00:45:23,613
I want to,
but it's just not safe for me to be here.

213
00:45:26,199 --> 00:45:28,910
- If I could borrow some cash...
- Of course.

214
00:45:28,993 --> 00:45:30,620
I need to take a bus.

215
00:45:30,703 --> 00:45:33,414
Well, at least let me walk you to the station.

216
00:45:35,416 --> 00:45:36,543
Okay.

217
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:42,841
- You have everything you need?
- Yeah.

218
00:45:46,052 --> 00:45:47,053
I.-

219
00:45:48,513 --> 00:45:49,514
What?

220
00:45:51,975 --> 00:45:54,060
- Good night.
- Good night.

221
00:45:54,143 --> 00:45:56,145
I hope you get some rest.

222
00:46:38,313 --> 00:46:40,940
We're giving you a very low dose only.

223
00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:43,902
I need you sharp out there and disciplined.

224
00:46:43,985 --> 00:46:45,987
First sign of any side effect,

225
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:49,782
we stop and you're off team
until you straighten out.

226
00:46:50,533 --> 00:46:52,327
- Ag reed?
- Ag reed.

227
00:46:56,205 --> 00:46:58,958
You'll get two separate infusions.

228
00:46:59,042 --> 00:47:03,254
One into the deep muscle,
one into the bone marrow centers.

229
00:47:03,338 --> 00:47:05,673
The bone ones are going to hurt.

230
00:47:52,261 --> 00:47:54,055
ls everything okay?

231
00:47:55,974 --> 00:47:57,392
I think so.

232
00:48:05,733 --> 00:48:07,068
Come here.

233
00:48:08,736 --> 00:48:10,780
- I just wanna do this.
- Oh.

234
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:14,075
- It's better like that.
- Yeah?

235
00:48:18,871 --> 00:48:20,331
It feels too tight, huh?

236
00:48:20,415 --> 00:48:22,250
- Yeah, a little.
- Okay.

237
00:48:29,674 --> 00:48:32,677
- What?
- They're here.

238
00:48:33,011 --> 00:48:34,429
- Betty, look at me, look at me!
- Bruce!

239
00:48:34,512 --> 00:48:35,763
You have to go far away
from me as you can!

240
00:48:35,847 --> 00:48:37,348
- Don't argue with me, just go. Go!
- Bruce!

241
00:48:48,568 --> 00:48:50,653
Damn it! We'd have had snipers on target
in three more minutes.

242
00:48:50,737 --> 00:48:52,280
I wanna know who jumped the gun.

243
00:48:54,532 --> 00:48:55,783
He's heading 2-7-0.

244
00:49:12,925 --> 00:49:14,594
Blonsky! Not yet!

245
00:49:16,012 --> 00:49:17,180
Sir.

246
00:49:18,806 --> 00:49:20,475
Look alive. This could get interesting.

247
00:50:08,648 --> 00:50:09,649
I got him!

248
00:50:09,857 --> 00:50:12,902
Stop! Stop!

249
00:50:14,737 --> 00:50:16,114
I know you're in there!

250
00:50:17,949 --> 00:50:19,575
General, please!

251
00:50:22,078 --> 00:50:23,121
Sir?

252
00:50:23,955 --> 00:50:24,997
Dad!

253
00:50:32,296 --> 00:50:36,425
- Dad, please don't do this.
- You can't see this clearly. Now, get inside.

254
00:50:36,509 --> 00:50:38,344
There he is!

255
00:50:38,427 --> 00:50:40,638
Target is in the overpass. We have a visual.

256
00:50:40,721 --> 00:50:42,890
Do not engage! Repeat, do not engage!

257
00:50:48,604 --> 00:50:50,189
He's locked in.

258
00:50:56,195 --> 00:50:57,738
Put two canisters in there with him.

259
00:50:58,489 --> 00:50:59,532
Fire!

260
00:51:18,718 --> 00:51:19,719
Get her back here!

261
00:51:54,212 --> 00:51:55,296
Now she'll see.

262
00:52:18,152 --> 00:52:19,278
Alpha team?

263
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:22,240
Let him have all of it.

264
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:30,122
Come on, light him up!

265
00:52:33,334 --> 00:52:36,671
Where are the fifty cals? Move your asses!

266
00:53:24,885 --> 00:53:26,053
Oh, my God!

267
00:53:29,724 --> 00:53:30,725
Blonsky, now you're up!

268
00:53:31,434 --> 00:53:32,435
Sir?

269
00:53:33,728 --> 00:53:35,062
Cover me.

270
00:53:53,122 --> 00:53:54,623
Remember me?

271
00:54:14,602 --> 00:54:16,020
My God, he's doing it.

272
00:54:21,067 --> 00:54:22,401
Move him toward the cannons!

273
00:54:28,532 --> 00:54:29,533
Move!

274
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:44,382
Hold your position!

275
00:54:44,465 --> 00:54:45,800
Do it now!

276
00:55:11,659 --> 00:55:13,160
Please, please, please, no!

277
00:55:13,244 --> 00:55:14,662
- Please, please, please!
- Get her back!

278
00:55:14,745 --> 00:55:15,788
You're killing him!

279
00:55:15,871 --> 00:55:18,207
Stop! Get off of me!

280
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:19,708
Bruce!

281
00:55:22,837 --> 00:55:26,715
Bruce! Bruce!

282
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,163
Where's the gunship?

283
00:56:17,349 --> 00:56:18,350
Is that it?

284
00:56:18,642 --> 00:56:20,394
Blonsky, pull back now.

285
00:56:20,478 --> 00:56:21,812
Pull back!

286
00:56:24,899 --> 00:56:26,734
Is that all you got?

287
00:56:34,241 --> 00:56:36,827
- Fall back!
- Fall back! Let's go, let's go!

288
00:56:36,911 --> 00:56:38,287
Find cover!

289
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:43,542
Betty!

290
00:56:57,014 --> 00:56:58,474
Fire, goddamn it!

291
00:57:00,267 --> 00:57:01,477
Bruce?

292
00:57:14,657 --> 00:57:15,908
Stop firing!

293
00:57:29,463 --> 00:57:30,881
No!

294
00:58:21,015 --> 00:58:23,559
You did the right thing, calling us.

295
00:58:25,686 --> 00:58:28,606
I need to know where they're going.

296
00:58:28,689 --> 00:58:30,816
She'll be in incredible danger
as long as she's with him.

297
00:58:30,899 --> 00:58:32,192
From who?

298
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:35,696
He protected her. You almost killed her.

299
00:58:35,779 --> 00:58:39,575
I give you my word, her safety
is my main concern at this point.

300
00:58:39,658 --> 00:58:42,328
You know, it's a point
of professional pride with me

301
00:58:42,411 --> 00:58:45,372
that I can always tell
when somebody's lying.

302
00:58:45,706 --> 00:58:46,874
And you are.

303
00:58:48,042 --> 00:58:50,336
I don't know where he's going.

304
00:58:51,295 --> 00:58:55,466
- I know she'll help him, if she can.
- Then she's aiding a fugitive.

305
00:58:56,717 --> 00:58:59,303
And I can't help either one of them.

306
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:07,436
I used to wonder
why she never talked about you.

307
00:59:07,811 --> 00:59:09,188
Now I know!

308
00:59:14,109 --> 00:59:16,403
Where does she meet these guys?

309
01:00:05,953 --> 01:00:07,121
Bruce?

310
01:00:17,297 --> 01:00:18,507
Bruce.

311
01:00:38,652 --> 01:00:40,821
It's okay. It's okay.

312
01:00:54,001 --> 01:00:56,754
Come here. Come this way.

313
01:00:59,965 --> 01:01:01,592
Watch your head.

314
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:17,691
Okay.

315
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:29,787
We're okay.

316
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:36,043
It's okay.

317
01:01:37,878 --> 01:01:39,630
It's just the rain.

318
01:01:48,889 --> 01:01:51,099
Will he ever walk again?

319
01:01:51,183 --> 01:01:54,728
Most of the bones in his body
look like crushed gravel right now.

320
01:01:54,812 --> 01:01:58,649
I will say this for him.
He's got a heart like a machine.

321
01:01:58,732 --> 01:02:01,902
Never seen anything like it,
outside of a racehorse.

322
01:03:04,506 --> 01:03:05,632
Here.

323
01:03:07,134 --> 01:03:08,135
Okay.

324
01:03:49,009 --> 01:03:50,177
Bruce?

325
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:52,971
Oh, hi.

326
01:03:53,513 --> 01:03:54,681
Are you okay?

327
01:03:55,307 --> 01:03:56,308
Yeah.

328
01:03:56,642 --> 01:03:58,852
Yeah, actually, I feel a lot better.

329
01:03:58,936 --> 01:04:01,521
- Good.
- I just had to get my data back.

330
01:04:03,106 --> 01:04:04,232
You ate it?

331
01:04:04,316 --> 01:04:08,528
Well, you know, the circumstances
called for a little improvisation.

332
01:04:08,612 --> 01:04:09,696
Wow.

333
01:04:11,198 --> 01:04:15,535
Okay, so they didn't have a great selection,
but I got you some options.

334
01:04:15,619 --> 01:04:18,246
First thing's first.

335
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:19,957
Oh, you're kidding me.

336
01:04:30,217 --> 01:04:31,343
What?

337
01:04:31,885 --> 01:04:34,763
- No.
- They were the stretchiest pair they had.

338
01:04:34,846 --> 01:04:36,181
I'll take my chances.

339
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:38,850
Rumors continue
to swirl about a violent clash

340
01:04:38,934 --> 01:04:42,771
between forces of the US military
and an unknown adversary

341
01:04:42,854 --> 01:04:45,816
on the campus of Culver University
earlier today.

342
01:04:45,899 --> 01:04:49,152
Sophomores Jack McGhee and Jim Wilson
witnessed some of the battle.

343
01:04:49,236 --> 01:04:50,654
It was so big.

344
01:04:50,737 --> 01:04:53,657
- It was like this huge, like, hulk!
- Yeah.

345
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:56,785
McGhee, who happens
to be a reporter for the campus paper,

346
01:04:56,868 --> 01:04:58,537
captured this on his cell phone.

347
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:00,330
Further search for the mysterious "hulk"

348
01:05:00,414 --> 01:05:04,960
was postponed by powerful thunderstorms
in the Smoky Mountain National Forest.

349
01:05:12,467 --> 01:05:15,387
Not too short back there.

350
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:17,931
I have done this before, you know.

351
01:05:33,864 --> 01:05:36,450
I don't know how you've done this
on your own for all this time.

352
01:05:36,533 --> 01:05:38,452
With clippers, usually.

353
01:06:33,298 --> 01:06:36,009
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
- What? What?

354
01:06:36,093 --> 01:06:37,427
We can't do this.

355
01:06:37,511 --> 01:06:39,638
- It's okay. I want to.
- No.

356
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:41,681
No.

357
01:06:42,933 --> 01:06:44,184
I can't.

358
01:06:47,729 --> 01:06:49,731
I can't get too excited.

359
01:06:52,442 --> 01:06:54,486
Not even a little excited?

360
01:06:57,197 --> 01:06:58,573
It's okay.

361
01:07:03,245 --> 01:07:05,122
Sir, it's Blonsky.

362
01:07:07,624 --> 01:07:10,544
Has anyone found out
if he has next of kin or family?

363
01:07:11,336 --> 01:07:13,004
Ask him yourself.

364
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:17,884
Sir?

365
01:07:38,071 --> 01:07:42,075
- Good to see you back on your feet, soldier.
- Thank you, sir.

366
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:50,292
How do you feel?

367
01:07:52,252 --> 01:07:54,671
Pissed off and ready for round three.

368
01:08:01,094 --> 01:08:05,056
Basically, we can't use any of this,
because they can track all of it.

369
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:07,976
Well, my lip gloss? Can they track that?

370
01:08:08,935 --> 01:08:12,022
- No. You can take your lip gloss.
- Thank you.

371
01:08:12,105 --> 01:08:15,025
- Well, I need my glasses.
- Well, you can take

372
01:08:15,108 --> 01:08:16,318
-your glasses and your watch, okay?
- Okay.

373
01:08:16,401 --> 01:08:20,030
We can use most of it. We just can't use
the credit cards, the ID or the phone.

374
01:08:20,113 --> 01:08:22,407
- Don't even turn that on.
- Okay.

375
01:08:22,532 --> 01:08:24,659
And we'll take the cash, obviously.

376
01:08:24,743 --> 01:08:28,663
How will we get where we need to go
on $40 and no credit cards?

377
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:34,544
Well, we could sell this.

378
01:08:34,628 --> 01:08:38,215
No. No, that's the only thing
you have left from her. No.

379
01:08:40,425 --> 01:08:43,136
Well, we'll have to try and get it back.

380
01:08:43,803 --> 01:08:45,722
Federal is
already monitoring phones,

381
01:08:45,805 --> 01:08:48,058
plastic and Dr. Ross's web accounts,

382
01:08:48,141 --> 01:08:50,393
and local PD have been placed on alert.

383
01:08:50,477 --> 01:08:53,104
They'll pop up somewhere
and when they do, it comes straight to us.

384
01:08:53,188 --> 01:08:55,190
They're not gonna just pop up.

385
01:08:55,273 --> 01:08:58,318
He made it five years and got across borders
without making any mistakes.

386
01:08:58,401 --> 01:09:00,237
He's not gonna use a damn credit card now.

387
01:09:00,654 --> 01:09:02,447
If he was trying to escape,
he'd be long gone.

388
01:09:02,530 --> 01:09:03,657
He's not trying to escape this time.

389
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:06,243
He's looking for help
and that's how we're gonna get him.

390
01:09:06,326 --> 01:09:08,745
We know what they're after and we know
he's been talking to somebody.

391
01:09:08,828 --> 01:09:10,664
You all have copies of the correspondence.

392
01:09:11,164 --> 01:09:13,208
The aliases Mr. Green and Mr. Blue

393
01:09:13,291 --> 01:09:15,418
have been added to the
SHIELD Operations Database.

394
01:09:16,419 --> 01:09:18,129
If he comes up for air, we'll be waiting.

395
01:09:19,381 --> 01:09:21,591
If he makes a peep, we'll hear him.

396
01:09:21,675 --> 01:09:24,094
And when he slips up, we'll be ready.

397
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:07,971
Hey.

398
01:10:09,931 --> 01:10:11,141
Smile.

399
01:10:21,568 --> 01:10:23,236
What is it like?

400
01:10:25,155 --> 01:10:27,907
When it happens, what do you experience?

401
01:10:28,658 --> 01:10:31,202
Remember those experiments
we volunteered for at Harvard?

402
01:10:31,286 --> 01:10:33,413
Those induced hallucinations?

403
01:10:34,164 --> 01:10:37,584
It's a lot like that,
just a thousand times amplified.

404
01:10:39,419 --> 01:10:43,340
It's like someone's poured
a liter of acid into my brain.

405
01:10:43,423 --> 01:10:48,261
- Do you remember anything?
- Just fragments. Images.

406
01:10:48,762 --> 01:10:51,890
There's too much noise.
I can never derive anything out of it.

407
01:10:51,973 --> 01:10:55,602
- But then it's still you inside it.
- No. No, it's not.

408
01:10:58,021 --> 01:11:02,275
I don't know.
In the cave, I really felt like it knew me.

409
01:11:03,026 --> 01:11:04,361
Maybe your mind is in there,

410
01:11:04,444 --> 01:11:07,030
it's just overcharged
and can't process what's happening.

411
01:11:07,113 --> 01:11:10,450
I don't want to control it.
I want to get rid of it.

412
01:11:23,671 --> 01:11:25,131
Are you ready?

413
01:11:25,215 --> 01:11:26,966
Let's even the playing field a little.

414
01:11:30,387 --> 01:11:31,679
Gentlemen.

415
01:11:35,642 --> 01:11:39,312
Bruce, wake up.
There's something going on.

416
01:11:50,407 --> 01:11:53,451
We got to go. Walk toward the back.
Just don't move too fast.

417
01:12:08,925 --> 01:12:10,552
All right. Come.

418
01:12:24,357 --> 01:12:28,695
It is a long way uptown.
I think the subway's probably quickest.

419
01:12:29,571 --> 01:12:31,448
Me in a metal tube, deep underground,

420
01:12:31,531 --> 01:12:34,033
with hundreds of people
in the most aggressive city in the world?

421
01:12:34,117 --> 01:12:36,786
Right. Let's get a cab.

422
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:41,082
Come on, now! Let's go!
You're too slow! You drive like a woman!

423
01:12:46,004 --> 01:12:47,589
- Very nice. You see her?
- Oh, my.

424
01:12:47,672 --> 01:12:50,800
Very pretty. Watch out, you goat!

425
01:12:50,884 --> 01:12:52,927
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

426
01:12:56,222 --> 01:12:58,850
Are you out of your mind?

427
01:12:58,933 --> 01:13:00,310
- What is wrong with you?
- What's the matter, baby?

428
01:13:00,393 --> 01:13:02,103
You don't like a good ride?

429
01:13:03,897 --> 01:13:05,190
Asshole!

430
01:13:08,318 --> 01:13:10,820
You know, I know a few
techniques could help you

431
01:13:10,904 --> 01:13:15,116
-manage that anger very effectively.
- You zip it. We're walking.

432
01:13:15,533 --> 01:13:16,576
Okay.

433
01:13:24,125 --> 01:13:26,044
Excuse me. Dr. Sterns?

434
01:13:26,127 --> 01:13:28,713
- Yes.
- I'm sorry to bother you. I'm Elizabeth Ross.

435
01:13:29,631 --> 01:13:31,633
Oh! Dr. Ross!

436
01:13:31,716 --> 01:13:34,636
- I have someone who'd like to meet you.
- Okay.

437
01:13:37,138 --> 01:13:38,598
It's Mr. Blue, isn't it?

438
01:13:40,433 --> 01:13:41,809
Mr. Green?

439
01:13:44,062 --> 01:13:47,690
I got to tell you,
I've been wondering if you were even real.

440
01:13:47,774 --> 01:13:49,526
And if you were, what would it look like?

441
01:13:49,609 --> 01:13:54,322
A person with that much
power lurking in him.

442
01:13:54,405 --> 01:13:56,032
Nothing could have surprised me more

443
01:13:56,115 --> 01:13:58,993
than this unassuming man
shaking my hand.

444
01:13:59,077 --> 01:14:01,704
But, look. We're not strolling
into the park for a picnic, here.

445
01:14:01,788 --> 01:14:03,498
Even if everything goes perfectly,

446
01:14:03,581 --> 01:14:07,460
if we induce an episode,
if we get the dosage exactly right,

447
01:14:08,461 --> 01:14:10,338
is that going to be a lasting cure

448
01:14:10,421 --> 01:14:13,800
or just some antidote to suppress
that specific flare-up?

449
01:14:16,052 --> 01:14:17,512
I don't know.

450
01:14:18,263 --> 01:14:22,976
What I'm saying is that if we overshoot this
by even the smallest integer

451
01:14:23,935 --> 01:14:28,815
we're dealing with concentrations
with extraordinary levels of toxicity.

452
01:14:28,898 --> 01:14:33,486
- You mean it could kill him.
- Kill him? Yeah. I should say so.

453
01:14:35,154 --> 01:14:37,240
You should know that there's
a flip side to this, too.

454
01:14:37,323 --> 01:14:40,910
If we miss on the low side,
if we induce me and it fails,

455
01:14:40,994 --> 01:14:43,454
this will be very dangerous for you.

456
01:14:45,248 --> 01:14:49,252
Look. I've always been
more curious than cautious,

457
01:14:49,335 --> 01:14:53,631
and that's served me pretty well.
So, are we going to do this?

458
01:15:48,686 --> 01:15:50,313
How you feeling, man?

459
01:15:52,065 --> 01:15:53,650
Like a monster.

460
01:16:13,586 --> 01:16:15,296
Okay. On the table.

461
01:16:16,047 --> 01:16:21,427
These will protect you from yourself
if you have a strong reaction.

462
01:16:22,679 --> 01:16:25,640
You can tell me later
if you thought it was strong.

463
01:16:29,852 --> 01:16:34,273
Oh, come on! Stupid graduate students.

464
01:16:38,903 --> 01:16:39,904
Okay...

465
01:16:40,613 --> 01:16:42,073
You, you, you.

466
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:47,161
This will be a somewhat novel sensation.

467
01:16:49,789 --> 01:16:51,332
We have begun.

468
01:16:53,167 --> 01:16:56,212
The dialysis machine will mix the antidote
with your blood.

469
01:16:56,295 --> 01:17:00,717
Except the antidote will only take hold
once we've achieved a full reaction.

470
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,009
Just relax.

471
01:17:02,802 --> 01:17:06,139
Okay. We are comprehensive.

472
01:17:09,308 --> 01:17:10,768
Here you go.

473
01:17:20,778 --> 01:17:22,822
All right. We set to pop?

474
01:17:25,283 --> 01:17:27,452
I'd take your hands off him.

475
01:17:47,263 --> 01:17:49,348
Oh, my God!

476
01:18:03,404 --> 01:18:05,448
Wait, wait! There's more! Wait!

477
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:18,795
- Now. Okay, now!
- Wait.

478
01:18:18,878 --> 01:18:21,506
Now, do it! Do it!

479
01:18:29,013 --> 01:18:31,516
Bruce! Bruce, look at me.

480
01:18:31,599 --> 01:18:36,103
Stay with me. The antidote, now!
Sterns, do it now!

481
01:18:37,563 --> 01:18:41,567
Bruce, look at me. Look in my eyes.
Please, look in my eyes.

482
01:18:42,735 --> 01:18:45,196
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

483
01:19:04,799 --> 01:19:06,008
Bruce.

484
01:19:06,092 --> 01:19:07,468
Oh, my God.

485
01:19:18,855 --> 01:19:21,858
Bruce? Bruce, can you hear me?

486
01:19:25,945 --> 01:19:27,113
Bruce?

487
01:19:35,913 --> 01:19:39,292
It's okay. You're okay. You're okay.

488
01:19:42,712 --> 01:19:44,088
You did it.

489
01:19:44,255 --> 01:19:46,883
He's fine. This is fantastic.

490
01:19:46,966 --> 01:19:48,342
It's over.

491
01:19:49,302 --> 01:19:50,344
Hi.

492
01:19:50,678 --> 01:19:51,679
Hi.

493
01:20:00,146 --> 01:20:06,110
That was the most extraordinary thing
I have seen in my entire life!

494
01:20:06,193 --> 01:20:07,737
Okay, you know what? Stop, please.

495
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:10,239
We need to go back and talk
about what just happened in there.

496
01:20:10,323 --> 01:20:14,076
Absolutely. Okay. The gamma pulse
came from the amygdala.

497
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:15,912
- I think Dr. Ross's primer...
- Are you okay?

498
01:20:15,995 --> 01:20:19,248
...lets the cells absorb the energy
temporarily, and then it abates.

499
01:20:19,332 --> 01:20:22,168
That's why you didn't die
of radiation sickness years ago!

500
01:20:22,251 --> 01:20:24,962
Now, maybe we've neutralized
those cells permanently,

501
01:20:25,046 --> 01:20:26,923
or maybe we just suppressed that event.

502
01:20:27,006 --> 01:20:29,383
I'm inclined to think the latter,
but it's hard to know

503
01:20:29,467 --> 01:20:31,260
because none of our
test subjects ever survived.

504
01:20:31,344 --> 01:20:32,970
- Of course, they weren't getting the primer!
- Wait, wait.

505
01:20:33,054 --> 01:20:34,472
- Wait, what did you just say?
- They weren't getting

506
01:20:34,555 --> 01:20:37,099
-the myostatin primer...
- No, no, no. Test subjects?

507
01:20:38,142 --> 01:20:39,894
What test subjects?

508
01:20:40,603 --> 01:20:41,687
Come with me.

509
01:20:58,746 --> 01:21:02,750
- What's the activity level?
- Snipers are covering Alpha sector.

510
01:21:03,501 --> 01:21:04,919
We started on rats and mice,

511
01:21:05,002 --> 01:21:07,588
but it just completely fried them,
so we had to go bigger.

512
01:21:07,838 --> 01:21:10,967
And we still don't know which is more toxic,
the gamma or your blood.

513
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:14,804
- What do you mean, my blood?
- Bruce, this is all you.

514
01:21:15,638 --> 01:21:19,642
You didn't send me much to work with,
so I had to concentrate it and make more.

515
01:21:19,725 --> 01:21:22,979
With a little more trial and error,
there's no end to what we can do!

516
01:21:23,062 --> 01:21:26,774
This is potentially Olympian!

517
01:21:26,857 --> 01:21:30,361
This gamma technology
has limitless applications.

518
01:21:30,444 --> 01:21:32,488
We'll unlock hundreds of cures.

519
01:21:32,571 --> 01:21:35,700
We will make humans
impervious to disease!

520
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:51,590
No, no, we've got to destroy it.

521
01:21:52,008 --> 01:21:53,884
- Wait, what?
- All of it.

522
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:55,344
Tonight. We're gonna incinerate it.

523
01:21:55,428 --> 01:21:57,680
- Is this the whole supply?
- What...

524
01:21:57,763 --> 01:21:59,348
We could get the Nobel for this!

525
01:21:59,432 --> 01:22:01,642
You don't understand
the power of this thing.

526
01:22:01,726 --> 01:22:04,353
It is too dangerous. It cannot be controlled.

527
01:22:05,062 --> 01:22:06,522
At your discretion, shooter.

528
01:22:06,605 --> 01:22:08,065
...three of us!
This is Promethean fire!

529
01:22:08,149 --> 01:22:09,191
BRUCE ON RADIO.' ll"S just.

530
01:22:09,275 --> 01:22:10,526
No Shot.

531
01:22:13,904 --> 01:22:15,656
Blonsky's going in.

532
01:22:17,867 --> 01:22:20,786
Blonsky, stand down.
My daughter's in there!

533
01:22:23,330 --> 01:22:24,415
We have the antidote now.

534
01:22:24,498 --> 01:22:27,334
They don't want the antidote!
They want to make it a weapon!

535
01:22:34,216 --> 01:22:36,260
And if we let it go, we will never get it back.

536
01:22:36,469 --> 01:22:38,471
You don't know how powerful this thing is.

537
01:22:38,554 --> 01:22:40,556
I hate the government
just as much as anyone,

538
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:42,475
but you're being a little paranoid,
don't you think?

539
01:22:50,274 --> 01:22:51,776
Bruce! Bruce!

540
01:22:53,486 --> 01:22:54,695
Get out.

541
01:22:57,990 --> 01:23:00,701
Where is it? Come on, where is it?

542
01:23:04,955 --> 01:23:06,624
Show him to me.

543
01:23:08,125 --> 01:23:09,376
Blonsky!

544
01:23:17,843 --> 01:23:18,969
Miss!

545
01:23:20,471 --> 01:23:21,847
Take this.

546
01:23:25,434 --> 01:23:30,022
If you took it from me, I'm gonna
put you in a hole for the rest of your life.

547
01:23:35,778 --> 01:23:36,987
Betty.

548
01:23:38,906 --> 01:23:41,909
I will never forgive what you've done to him.

549
01:23:41,992 --> 01:23:43,327
He's a fugitive.

550
01:23:43,410 --> 01:23:45,371
You made him a fugitive

551
01:23:45,454 --> 01:23:48,958
to cover your failures
and to protect your career.

552
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:52,586
Don't ever speak to me
as your daughter again.

553
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:58,384
It's only because you're my daughter
that you're not in handcuffs, too.

554
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:04,473
Are you telling me
you can make more like him?

555
01:24:04,557 --> 01:24:09,311
No! Not yet. I sorted out a few pieces,
but it's not like I can put together

556
01:24:09,395 --> 01:24:12,731
the same Humpty Dumpty,
if that's what you're asking.

557
01:24:12,815 --> 01:24:16,694
He was a freak accident!
The goal is to do it better!

558
01:24:16,777 --> 01:24:18,737
So Banner's the only...

559
01:24:22,491 --> 01:24:26,912
- She's an annoying bitch.
- Why are you always hitting people?

560
01:24:29,373 --> 01:24:34,420
Now what possibly could I have done
to deserve such aggression?

561
01:24:34,503 --> 01:24:37,256
It's not what you've done.
It's what you're gonna do.

562
01:24:38,174 --> 01:24:40,634
I want what you got out of Banner.
I want that.

563
01:24:44,138 --> 01:24:48,225
You look like you've got a little
something in you already, don't you?

564
01:24:49,518 --> 01:24:53,147
I want more.
You've seen what he becomes, right?

565
01:24:53,898 --> 01:24:55,107
I have.

566
01:24:56,025 --> 01:24:57,610
And it's beautiful.

567
01:24:58,444 --> 01:24:59,653
Godlike.

568
01:24:59,904 --> 01:25:01,614
Well, I want that.

569
01:25:03,782 --> 01:25:05,826
I need that. Make me that.

570
01:25:06,702 --> 01:25:09,705
I don't know what you've got
inside you already.

571
01:25:09,788 --> 01:25:11,415
The mix could be

572
01:25:11,999 --> 01:25:13,542
an abomination.

573
01:25:17,213 --> 01:25:20,090
I didn't say I was unwilling.

574
01:25:20,633 --> 01:25:24,345
I just need informed consent.

575
01:25:26,847 --> 01:25:28,641
And you've given it.

576
01:26:09,765 --> 01:26:14,019
This is what I was trying to explain.

577
01:26:14,103 --> 01:26:19,024
I don't know what you've been
ladling into yourself.

578
01:26:19,108 --> 01:26:21,193
But clearly it worked.

579
01:26:21,277 --> 01:26:24,905
Let's assume you don't understand
a word I'm saying,

580
01:26:24,989 --> 01:26:29,827
but if you'll just get back on the table,

581
01:26:29,910 --> 01:26:32,413
I can fix this.

582
01:26:47,303 --> 01:26:49,054
Shoot it!
Hey!

583
01:26:49,805 --> 01:26:50,806
No!

584
01:27:00,524 --> 01:27:02,609
Delta 4 to Leader.

585
01:27:02,693 --> 01:27:04,361
They took out two of our guys,
two of our guys!

586
01:27:04,445 --> 01:27:07,156
Blonsky and the Major are still inside!

587
01:27:10,034 --> 01:27:12,328
Come on! Move, move, move, move!

588
01:27:20,294 --> 01:27:21,920
It's over there!

589
01:27:23,672 --> 01:27:24,840
Drop them!

590
01:27:24,923 --> 01:27:27,176
- What is that thing?
- Shoot it!

591
01:27:36,643 --> 01:27:40,439
Okay. All right! You... You, drive!
Let's go! Move, move!

592
01:27:40,522 --> 01:27:41,857
- Delta 4 to Leader!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

593
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:43,901
Something big
just went off down here!

594
01:27:44,443 --> 01:27:46,528
General, you should hear this!

595
01:27:46,612 --> 01:27:49,531
The Hulk is in the street!
I repeat, the Hulk is in the street!

596
01:27:52,117 --> 01:27:54,203
That's impossible.
You get a hold of yourself, young man.

597
01:27:54,286 --> 01:27:56,246
You get it together. What is your position?

598
01:27:56,455 --> 01:27:59,583
121st Street, heading north on Broadway!

599
01:27:59,666 --> 01:28:01,251
Turn us around.

600
01:28:08,175 --> 01:28:11,387
We're going back. Why are we going back?

601
01:28:11,470 --> 01:28:13,138
Damn it! Give me eyes down there!

602
01:28:13,514 --> 01:28:14,807
Yes, sir!

603
01:28:16,809 --> 01:28:18,769
What the hell was that?

604
01:28:19,103 --> 01:28:20,687
Go, go, go!

605
01:28:44,294 --> 01:28:45,504
No!

606
01:29:01,812 --> 01:29:03,147
One of yours?

607
01:29:03,355 --> 01:29:06,442
Oh, my God. What have you done?

608
01:29:08,777 --> 01:29:10,612
Fire at him, fire at him!

609
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:17,035
Do you think a rifle's gonna hurt that?

610
01:29:17,453 --> 01:29:18,704
Come on!

611
01:29:22,207 --> 01:29:23,375
Sweet.

612
01:29:26,295 --> 01:29:27,546
Booyah!

613
01:29:45,564 --> 01:29:46,899
Get out of there, soldier!

614
01:29:50,235 --> 01:29:51,820
Stacy!

615
01:30:22,476 --> 01:30:24,436
Give me a real fight!

616
01:30:32,486 --> 01:30:33,654
Sir?

617
01:30:36,323 --> 01:30:37,324
Sir?

618
01:30:38,992 --> 01:30:41,995
Tell them to bring everything they've got
and head for Harlem.

619
01:30:45,415 --> 01:30:48,835
It has to be me.
You have to take me back there.

620
01:30:49,169 --> 01:30:50,754
What are you saying?

621
01:30:50,879 --> 01:30:52,172
You think you can control it?

622
01:30:52,256 --> 01:30:55,384
No, no, not control it,
but, I don't know, maybe aim it.

623
01:30:55,467 --> 01:30:56,969
And what if you can't?

624
01:30:58,470 --> 01:31:00,222
We made this thing.

625
01:31:00,722 --> 01:31:02,099
All of us.

626
01:31:03,058 --> 01:31:04,309
Please.

627
01:31:09,231 --> 01:31:11,733
- Land us near it.
- No, no. No, keep us high.

628
01:31:13,318 --> 01:31:14,653
Open the back door.

629
01:31:20,450 --> 01:31:25,289
Bruce! Bruce, stop!
Stop! What are you doing?

630
01:31:25,372 --> 01:31:29,126
Think about this!
You don't even know if you'll change!

631
01:31:31,128 --> 01:31:34,298
You don't have to do this!
Please, this is insane!

632
01:31:34,381 --> 01:31:36,174
Betty, I've got to try.

633
01:31:38,343 --> 01:31:39,678
I'm sorry.

634
01:32:02,367 --> 01:32:03,952
Oh, shit!

635
01:32:07,998 --> 01:32:10,792
- Get her in here!
- Come on, miss.

636
01:32:28,226 --> 01:32:30,270
There. Betty!

637
01:32:49,331 --> 01:32:50,916
Hulk!

638
01:32:55,671 --> 01:32:57,422
Yeah!

639
01:33:41,633 --> 01:33:42,926
Come on!

640
01:34:15,167 --> 01:34:17,085
Is that all you've got?

641
01:34:30,849 --> 01:34:33,602
Use that thing, soldier! Give him some help!

642
01:34:33,685 --> 01:34:34,936
Which one?

643
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:37,355
Help the green one, damn it!
Which one do you think?

644
01:34:37,439 --> 01:34:39,316
Cut the other one in half!

645
01:34:41,985 --> 01:34:43,111
Ross!

646
01:35:07,886 --> 01:35:09,679
Keep it on him!

647
01:35:37,874 --> 01:35:40,836
- Look, I got to put it down!
- Hang on!

648
01:36:48,111 --> 01:36:49,195
Dad?

649
01:36:51,823 --> 01:36:54,326
Are you hurt? Let me help you.

650
01:37:02,167 --> 01:37:04,586
I'm all right. Just find a way out.

651
01:37:51,841 --> 01:37:58,515
You don't deserve this power!
Now watch her die!

652
01:38:49,190 --> 01:38:50,859
Look out!

653
01:39:21,681 --> 01:39:22,974
General?

654
01:39:29,189 --> 01:39:31,816
Any last words?

655
01:39:34,611 --> 01:39:37,989
Hulk smash!

656
01:40:25,537 --> 01:40:27,163
Stop!

657
01:41:47,869 --> 01:41:49,245
It's okay.

658
01:41:59,339 --> 01:42:01,007
Betty.

659
01:44:29,030 --> 01:44:30,365
Reload.

660
01:44:37,914 --> 01:44:39,123
Reload.

661
01:44:55,139 --> 01:44:58,309
The smell of stale beer and defeat.

662
01:44:58,393 --> 01:45:00,144
You know, I hate to say,
"I told you so," General,

663
01:45:00,228 --> 01:45:04,649
but that Super Soldier program
was put on ice for a reason.

664
01:45:04,732 --> 01:45:07,652
I've always felt hardware was more reliable.

665
01:45:07,819 --> 01:45:10,113
- Stark.
- General.

666
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:14,951
You always wear such nice suits.

667
01:45:15,910 --> 01:45:17,245
Touché.

668
01:45:18,162 --> 01:45:21,874
- I hear you have an unusual problem.
- You should talk.

669
01:45:21,958 --> 01:45:23,459
You should listen.

670
01:45:26,170 --> 01:45:29,632
What if I told you
we were putting a team together?

671
01:45:29,715 --> 01:45:31,300
Who's "we"?
