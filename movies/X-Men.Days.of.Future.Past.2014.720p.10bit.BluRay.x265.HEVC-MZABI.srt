
1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:18,050


2
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:16,327
<i>The future.</i>

3
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:19,831
<i>A dark, desolate world.</i>

4
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:31,009
<i>A world of war,
suffering, loss...</i>

5
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:33,219
<i>on both sides.</i>

6
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:38,808
<i>Mutants and the humans
who dared to help them.</i>

7
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:46,441
<i>Fighting an enemy
we cannot defeat.</i>

8
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:16,221
<i>Are we destined down this path?</i>

9
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:21,768
<i>Destined to destroy ourselves
like so many species before us?</i>

10
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:29,150
<i>Or can we evolve fast
enough to change ourselves?</i>

11
00:02:29,776 --> 00:02:31,152
<i>Change our fate?</i>

12
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:40,745
<i>Is the future truly set?</i>

13
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,252
They're here!

14
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:18,051
Time's up.

15
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:19,218
Sentinels!

16
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:24,474
Sunspot!

17
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:30,563
Let's go.

18
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:20,822
Run!

19
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:23,533
Go!

20
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,010
Blink! No!

21
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:54,600
Too late, assholes.

22
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,746
Don't move, you mutant scum!

23
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,626
No!

24
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:24,213
Flat on the ground,
hands behind your head!

25
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:31,762
<i>So few of us left.</i>

26
00:08:35,141 --> 00:08:36,183
<i>Professor?</i>

27
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:38,728
I've found them.

28
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:12,154
Professor!

29
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:15,408
Bobby. Hey, Storm.

30
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:17,576
Hey, kid.

31
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:21,122
Professor, you made it.

32
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:46,814
Whenever the Sentinels attack,
Warpath spots them...

33
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,316
then I send Bishop
back to warn us

34
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,901
of the attack before it happens.

35
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:53,863
Blink scouts the next site...

36
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,949
and then we leave before they
ever know we were there.

37
00:10:57,116 --> 00:10:59,744
Because... we never were.

38
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,746
What do you mean
you were never there?

39
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,330
She projects Bishop back in time

40
00:11:03,414 --> 00:11:04,957
a few days to warn the others...

41
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:06,751
of the coming attack.

42
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,044
So she sends
Bishop back in time?

43
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,839
No, just his consciousness,
into his younger self.

44
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:13,257
His younger body.

45
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,217
Wow.

46
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:19,013
This might just work, Charles.

47
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:21,307
What might work?

48
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:27,104
The Sentinel program was originally
conceived by Doctor Bolivar Trask.

49
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:31,901
In the early '70s, he was one of the
world's leading weapons designers.

50
00:11:32,151 --> 00:11:36,363
<i>But, covertly, he had begun
experimenting on mutants...</i>

51
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,700
<i>using their gifts
to fuel his own research.</i>

52
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:41,243
This is extraordinary.

53
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,622
<i>There was one mutant who had
discovered what he was doing.</i>

54
00:11:44,914 --> 00:11:49,627
A mutant with the ability to
transform herself into anyone.

55
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:51,545
Mystique.

56
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:54,507
<i>I knew her as Raven.</i>

57
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:56,133
We met when we were children,

58
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:58,052
grew up together.

59
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:00,721
She was like a sister to me.

60
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:02,765
I tried to help her...

61
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:06,477
but only succeeded
in driving her away.

62
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:10,064
She hunted Trask
across the world.

63
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,692
And at the Paris
Peace Accords in 1973,

64
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:15,027
<i>after the Vietnam War...</i>

65
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:17,238
<i>she found Trask...</i>

66
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:21,867
and killed him.

67
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,750
<i>It was the first
time she killed.</i>

68
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,460
It wasn't her last.

69
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:35,381
But killing Trask did not have
the outcome she expected.

70
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,299
It only persuaded the government

71
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:39,552
of the need for his program.

72
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,929
They captured her that day...

73
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:44,890
tortured her,
experimented on her.

74
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:50,437
<i>In her DNA, they discovered the secrets
to her powers of transformation.</i>

75
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,648
<i>It gave them the key
they needed...</i>

76
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:56,777
<i>to create weapons that could
adapt to any mutant power.</i>

77
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:59,196
<i>And in less than 50 years...</i>

78
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:01,532
<i>the machines
that have destroyed...</i>

79
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:04,618
<i>so many of our kind
were created.</i>

80
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:09,248
But it all started
that day in 1973...

81
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:11,125
the day she first killed.

82
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,879
The day she truly became...
Mystique.

83
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,299
You want to go back there.

84
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:21,760
If I can get to her,
stop the assassination...

85
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:23,304
keep her out of their hands...

86
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:26,891
then we can stop the Sentinels
from ever being born.

87
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:30,227
And end this war
before it ever begins.

88
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:37,318
Uh, I can send someone back
a couple weeks.

89
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,236
Maybe a month.

90
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,573
But you're talking about
going back decades.

91
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:45,576
You have the most powerful brain
in the world, Professor...

92
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:49,914
but the mind can only stretch
so far before it snaps.

93
00:13:50,456 --> 00:13:53,542
It would rip you apart.
I'm sorry.

94
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:55,878
No one could survive that trip.

95
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:59,256
What if someone's mind
has a way of snapping back?

96
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,427
What if someone can heal as
fast as they're ripped apart?

97
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,595
It's a risk.

98
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:05,930
Yeah, I'm getting that.

99
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,723
Not just for you.

100
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:10,184
You do this, you change history.

101
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:11,507
Well, that's kind of the point.

102
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,771
Some of us could be killed.

103
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:16,065
Some of us may never be born.

104
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:18,484
We have no idea
how things may change.

105
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:20,527
We could keep going.

106
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,237
Keep fighting.

107
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:23,614
Until what?

108
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:27,660
You've got a decision to make.

109
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:29,787
You can keep sending
Bishop back in time

110
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,914
over and over again to warn you,

111
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:36,043
until one day, he doesn't
make it, and you all die.

112
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:38,045
Or you can give up this life.

113
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:40,798
So that they and everyone
else who died in this war

114
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,883
can actually have a future.

115
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:45,427
You're asking us
to sacrifice our lives

116
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:47,596
for a future we might not
even be a part of.

117
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:48,973
Yes.

118
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,016
A second chance.

119
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,436
A better chance for everyone.

120
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:01,318
My people need to vote.

121
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,573
They just did.

122
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:09,034
They're in.

123
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:28,679
Okay, spread out.

124
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:31,015
Take your positions.

125
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:47,573
So I wake up in my younger
body, God knows where.

126
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:48,866
Then what?

127
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:52,036
You'll need to go to
my house and find me.

128
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,788
Convince me of all of this.

129
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:56,582
Won't you be able to
just read my mind?

130
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:59,877
I didn't have my powers in 1973.

131
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:04,381
Logan, you're going to have to do
for me what I once did for you.

132
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,342
Lead me, guide me.

133
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,970
I was a very different man then.

134
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,264
You'll have to be
patient with me.

135
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:15,559
Patience is my strongest suit.

136
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:17,895
You'll need me as well. What?

137
00:16:18,062 --> 00:16:20,814
After Mystique left Charles,
she came with me...

138
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:24,026
and I set her on
a dangerous path.

139
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,652
A darker path.

140
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:28,405
It's going to take the two
of us, side by side...

141
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:31,200
at a time when we couldn't
be further apart.

142
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:35,913
Great.

143
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,415
So where do I find you?

144
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:40,250
Well, it's complicated.

145
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:43,796
Are you sure about this?

146
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,062
It's not just his power
that'll be tested.

147
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:49,218
I've seen what this
can do to you.

148
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:51,762
I can handle this.

149
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:53,764
Trust me.

150
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:58,644
I guess I'll see you
in the next life.

151
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:15,160
Basically, your
body will go to sleep

152
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:17,621
while your mind travels
back in time.

153
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:22,000
As long as you're back there, past and
present will continue to coexist.

154
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,794
But once you wake up...

155
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:27,840
whatever you've done will
take hold and become history.

156
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:31,051
And for the rest of us, it will
be the only history that we know.

157
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,513
It will be like the last
50 years never happened.

158
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:37,182
And this world, and this war...

159
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:40,727
the only person who will
remember it is you.

160
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:43,605
All right, Logan...

161
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:45,315
I need you to clear your head

162
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:46,900
and to stay as calm as possible.

163
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:48,485
What? What do you mean?

164
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,946
If your mind gets rocky, it will
be harder for me to hold you...

165
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,407
and you could start to slip
between past and future.

166
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,492
What if I need to get
a little rocky?

167
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:57,911
Think peaceful thoughts?

168
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:00,914
Peaceful thoughts...
Do you have any good news?

169
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,918
Well, you don't really age, so
you'll pretty much look the same.

170
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,921
You won't have
much time in the past.

171
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,631
The Sentinels will find us.

172
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:11,049
They always do.

173
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:12,843
And this time,
we won't be able to run.

174
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,553
We'll have no escape.

175
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:17,890
This is our last chance.

176
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:22,186
You really think this will work?
I have faith in him.

177
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:24,229
It's not him I'm
worried about, it's us.

178
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:27,524
We were young... we
didn't know any better.

179
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:31,028
We will now.

180
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,405
See you all soon.

181
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:36,575
This might sting a little.

182
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:27,960
<i>The first time.</i>

183
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:34,174
<i>Ever I saw your face.</i>

184
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:36,843
Whoa.

185
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:45,352
<i>I thought the sun.</i>

186
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:47,938
<i>Rose in your eyes.</i>

187
00:19:58,073 --> 00:20:03,620
<i>And the moon and the stars.</i>

188
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,545
<i>Were the gifts you gave.</i>

189
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,088
Holy shit.

190
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,764
It worked.

191
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,562
Hey, what's going on?

192
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,772
Gwen, get dressed.
Who the hell are you?

193
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:31,982
Hey, I don't know
what's going on.

194
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,400
You're supposed to be

195
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:34,693
guarding the boss's daughter,
not screwing her.

196
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,695
Well, I didn't sleep with her.

197
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,488
No? No.

198
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:41,908
I mean, yes, I slept
with her many times.

199
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:43,243
Jimmy!

200
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,829
That wasn't me.
That was the old me.

201
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,582
I just got here 20 seconds ago.

202
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:49,666
Really?

203
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,751
Then what happened
to your clothes?

204
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,377
My... Oh.

205
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:54,421
Would you believe
me if I told you

206
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:56,006
I was sent here from the future?

207
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:57,507
Huh?

208
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:00,343
Get out of here, sweetheart.
Yeah.

209
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,262
We're gonna take care of this comedian.
No, you're not.

210
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:04,556
You're gonna give me the keys to
your car and some money for gas...

211
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:05,849
or you're gonna wake
up in the hospital.

212
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,726
Trust me, I know how
these things play out.

213
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:09,436
Oh. Because you're
from the future?

214
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,562
No.

215
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,355
Because of these.

216
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,151
What the hell?

217
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,783
God damn it!

218
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:48,683
Peaceful thoughts.

219
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:09,037
Jimmy! What happened to Ramon?

220
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:11,289
And why are you
talking crazy talk?

221
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:12,749
Look, uh... Gwen.

222
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,585
Gwen, you're gonna wanna lay
low for a few days, all right?

223
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,087
Starting now.

224
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,171
Come on, out.

225
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:20,257
Go.

226
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:30,433
Hmm.

227
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:36,106
<i>Today, the 18th MP Brigade
is departing from Saigon,</i>

228
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:39,151
<i>marking the last American
troops to leave Vietnam.</i>

229
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:41,903
<i>And effectively ending the war.</i>

230
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:47,033
We are reviewing all of our
defense expenditures...

231
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,244
and all the black books
are being opened.

232
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:53,206
We can't support a weapon
that targets our own citizens.

233
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:54,916
If these mutants,
as you describe...

234
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,419
are already living among us...

235
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:59,421
then they are living
here peacefully.

236
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:01,173
We haven't had an incident
in over 10 years.

237
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:02,591
After what happened in Cuba?

238
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:04,050
That was never confirmed.

239
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:06,428
We have very real
enemies out there...

240
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:07,929
the Russians, the Chinese.

241
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:11,099
We are talking about
a tenth of a tenth...

242
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:13,310
of a tenth of our population.

243
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:15,812
Allow me to read
something to you.

244
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,022
Please.

245
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:19,983
This was acquired by
our friends at the CIA.

246
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,401
It's a dissertation...

247
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:25,238
written by a mutant
at Oxford University.

248
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:27,407
And I quote...

249
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:29,743
"To Homo Neanderthalensis..."

250
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,120
"his mutant cousin,
Homo Sapiens..."

251
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:36,082
which is us... "was
an aberration."

252
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:39,377
"The arrival of the mutated
human species, Homo Sapiens..."

253
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:43,882
"was followed by the immediate
extinction of their less evolved kin."

254
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:45,508
Well...

255
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:50,513
Now, we are the Neanderthal.

256
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,432
Speak for yourself, Dr. Trask.

257
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:57,312
You know, when you sent our
soldiers to Vietnam...

258
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,105
without the weapons they
needed to win the war...

259
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:01,191
you underestimated your enemy.

260
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:05,904
You do that with this enemy...
Mmm...

261
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:08,990
and it won't be some border
skirmish halfway around the world.

262
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:11,326
This time, the war will
be for our streets...

263
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:13,703
our cities, our homes...

264
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:17,916
and by the time you see the
need for my program...

265
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,377
it will be too late...

266
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:25,173
and you will have lost
two wars in one lifetime.

267
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:30,220
We are sorry, Dr. Trask...

268
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:32,973
but your Sentinel Program...

269
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:35,600
it ain't gonna fly.

270
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:49,364
Can I help you, Colonel?

271
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:51,741
Just here to give our
boys a proper send-off.

272
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:55,203
I'm sorry, sir, but we have orders.
This is a quarantined area.

273
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,372
Stand aside, soldier.

274
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,416
That's an order.

275
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,551
Atten-hut!

276
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:11,636
At ease.

277
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:36,328
What is all this?

278
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:37,996
Lab reports, blood tests.

279
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:39,831
It's all getting packed up
and shipped back.

280
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:41,041
Where is it going?

281
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:42,167
Same place they are.

282
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:44,252
Trask Industries.

283
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:47,380
Let's go, gentlemen.

284
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:49,758
I'm taking you out
of this shit show.

285
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:51,760
Shipping home?

286
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:53,970
Not just yet.

287
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:56,181
What are you doing with those?

288
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:58,058
Something to make the ride
a little smoother.

289
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:00,643
I'm transferring you
to a private facility...

290
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:03,146
where we can run
a few more tests.

291
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:10,195
Your men are not military.

292
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:12,530
Private outfit.

293
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:14,491
We're authorized
to remand these men.

294
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:15,700
Hmm.

295
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,872
These troops are going home.

296
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,043
Well, Colonel, I don't believe you
have jurisdiction in this matter.

297
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,296
I'm afraid I do, son.

298
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:29,589
I'm sorry, who are you?

299
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:31,883
The question is, Major...

300
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:37,138
...who are you?

301
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,643
Raven!

302
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,437
That's not my name.

303
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:33,027
I had that.

304
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:34,279
I know.

305
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:38,074
Let's move out.
Come on, let's go.

306
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:39,409
Where's Erik?

307
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:40,660
I'm on my own now.

308
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:45,415
Let's go! Move it!

309
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:05,727
Hold that plane!

310
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:09,063
Wouldn't wanna leave these boys
in this godforsaken country.

311
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,231
Yes, sir.

312
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:12,775
You're not coming
with us, are you?

313
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:14,611
My war's not over.

314
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:16,321
The enemy is still out there.

315
00:28:39,594 --> 00:28:41,513
The four privates,
where did they go?

316
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,515
They were headed
towards the tarmac.

317
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:43,658
Can I help you?

318
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:46,536
Uh... Yeah, what
happened to the school?

319
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:49,664
The school's been shut for years.
Are you a parent?

320
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:52,458
I sure as hell
hope not. Who are you?

321
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:54,669
I'm Hank. Hank McCoy.

322
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:56,838
I look after the house now.

323
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,881
You're Beast?

324
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:01,384
Look at you. I guess
you're a late bloomer.

325
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:02,635
I don't know what
you're talking about,

326
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,304
but I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

327
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:06,139
So where's the Professor?

328
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:07,473
There's no professor here.

329
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:09,684
You're pretty strong
for a scrawny kid.

330
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:12,145
You sure there's not
a little Beast in there?

331
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:13,938
No, he's not here.
Come on, Beast.

332
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:15,481
Come on, Beastie. No.

333
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,317
Hey!

334
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,069
I said the school's closed.

335
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:22,196
You need to leave. Not
until I see the Professor.

336
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:24,824
There's no professor here,
I told you that.

337
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:28,494
Look, kid. You and I are
gonna be good friends.

338
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:32,707
You just don't know it yet.

339
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:36,753
Professor!

340
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:44,093
Professor!

341
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,777
Hank?

342
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:02,737
What's going on here?

343
00:31:04,072 --> 00:31:05,239
Professor?

344
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:06,616
Please don't call me that.

345
00:31:06,741 --> 00:31:08,242
Why? You know this guy?

346
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:10,703
Yeah, he looks
slightly familiar.

347
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:12,997
Get off the bloody
chandelier, Hank.

348
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:16,209
You can walk.

349
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:17,585
You're a perceptive one.

350
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,253
I thought Erik...

351
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,546
Which makes it
slightly perplexing that

352
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,507
you missed our
sign on the way in.

353
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,841
This is private property,
my friend.

354
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:26,052
I'm gonna have to ask him
to ask you to leave.

355
00:31:26,177 --> 00:31:27,595
Well.

356
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,597
I'm afraid I can't do that...

357
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:33,643
because, uh,
I was sent here for you.

358
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:36,813
Tell whoever it was
that sent you that I'm busy.

359
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,050
That's gonna be
a little tricky...

360
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:42,819
because the person
who sent me was you.

361
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:43,986
What?

362
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:45,655
About 50 years from now.

363
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,411
I know. Stay with me.

364
00:31:51,494 --> 00:31:53,996
Like in the future, 50
years from now? Yeah.

365
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,998
I sent you from the future?
Yeah.

366
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:57,709
Piss off.

367
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:01,504
If you had your powers, you'd
know I was telling the truth.

368
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:04,215
How do you know
I don't have my p...

369
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:06,050
Who are you? I told you.

370
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:07,593
Are you CIA? No.

371
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:08,678
You've been watching me?

372
00:32:08,803 --> 00:32:10,471
I know you, Charles.

373
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:12,557
We've been friends for years.

374
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:14,684
I know your powers
came when you were 9.

375
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:17,562
I know you thought you were
going crazy when it started...

376
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:19,772
all the voices in your head.

377
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:21,399
And it wasn't
until you were 12...

378
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:24,986
that you realized all the voices
were in everyone else's head.

379
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:27,363
Do you want me to go on?

380
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:30,032
I never told anyone that.

381
00:32:30,116 --> 00:32:33,744
Not yet, no, but, you will.

382
00:32:34,996 --> 00:32:36,436
All right,
you've piqued my interest.

383
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:38,082
What do you want?

384
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:40,334
We have to stop Raven.

385
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,589
I need your help.

386
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:47,508
We need your help.

387
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:53,806
I think I'd like to wake up now.

388
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:00,980
What does she
have to do with this?

389
00:33:05,193 --> 00:33:06,861
<i>So you're saying...</i>

390
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:09,155
they took Raven's
power, and what?

391
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:11,699
They weaponized it?

392
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:12,867
Yep.

393
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:15,077
She is unique.

394
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:17,163
Yeah, she is, Hank.

395
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:20,249
In the beginning, the Sentinels
were just targeting mutants.

396
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:23,211
Then they began to identify the
genetics in non-mutants...

397
00:33:24,587 --> 00:33:27,965
who would eventually have mutant
children and grandchildren.

398
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:31,511
Many of the humans tried to help
us, but it was a slaughter.

399
00:33:31,928 --> 00:33:34,680
Leaving only the worst
of humanity in charge.

400
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:36,807
I've been in a lot of wars.

401
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:40,811
I'd never seen
anything like this.

402
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:43,105
And it all starts with her.

403
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:45,650
Let's just say
for the sake of...

404
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:49,403
the sake, that I
choose to believe you...

405
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,615
that I choose to help you.
Raven won't listen to me.

406
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:58,704
Her heart and soul
belong to someone else now.

407
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,206
I know.

408
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,710
That's why we're
gonna need Magneto, too.

409
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:07,338
Erik?

410
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,048
You do know where he is? Yeah.

411
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:15,429
Could you give me that
one more time, please?

412
00:34:15,513 --> 00:34:16,597
You heard me.

413
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:23,145
He's where he belongs.

414
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:25,690
You're just gonna walk out?

415
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:28,401
Ooh, top marks. Like I
said, you are perceptive.

416
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:30,404
The Professor I know
would never turn his back...

417
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:32,405
on someone who'd
lost their path.

418
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:34,574
Especially someone he loved.

419
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:40,663
You know... I think I
do remember you now.

420
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:44,875
Yeah. Tall, angry fellow
with the contentious hair.

421
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:47,878
We came to you a long time ago...
seeking your help.

422
00:34:48,713 --> 00:34:52,174
And I'm gonna say to you
what you said to us then.

423
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:55,136
Fuck off.

424
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:56,887
Listen to me, you little shit.

425
00:34:57,346 --> 00:35:00,474
I've come a long way, and I've
watched a lot of people die.

426
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:02,310
Good people. Friends.

427
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,853
If you're gonna
wallow in self-pity...

428
00:35:03,978 --> 00:35:05,813
and do nothing, then you're
gonna watch the same thing...

429
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:07,565
you understand?

430
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,322
We all have to die sometime.

431
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:21,037
Told you there was
no professor here.

432
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:25,124
What the hell happened to him?

433
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:31,047
<i>He lost everything.</i>

434
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:35,593
<i>Erik, Raven... his legs.</i>

435
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,638
<i>We built the school,
the labs, this whole place...</i>

436
00:35:38,846 --> 00:35:42,558
then, just after
the first semester...

437
00:35:42,725 --> 00:35:44,310
the war in Vietnam got worse.

438
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:46,896
Many of the teachers...

439
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:49,899
and older students were drafted.

440
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:51,609
It broke him.

441
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:54,403
<i>He retreated into himself.</i>

442
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,822
<i>I wanted to help,
do something...</i>

443
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,033
<i>so I designed a serum
to treat his spine...</i>

444
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,245
<i>derived from the same formula that
helps me control my mutation.</i>

445
00:36:04,497 --> 00:36:07,208
I take just enough
to keep myself balanced...

446
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:10,336
but he takes too much.

447
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:12,755
I tried easing him back...

448
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:16,425
but he just couldn't bear
the pain, the voices.

449
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:19,053
The treatment
gives him his legs...

450
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:21,722
but it's not enough.

451
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:22,932
He's...

452
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:27,228
He's just lost too much.

453
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:42,076
<i>You're not scared of me?</i>

454
00:36:42,952 --> 00:36:46,163
<i>I always believed I couldn't
be the only one in the world.</i>

455
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,207
<i>Charles Xavier.</i>

456
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:52,086
Raven.

457
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:55,172
You're hungry and alone.

458
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:57,007
Take whatever you want.

459
00:36:57,091 --> 00:37:00,010
We've got lots of food.
You don't have to steal.

460
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:02,221
In fact...

461
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:04,890
<i>you never have to steal again.</i>

462
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:07,226
<i>And that's a promise.</i>

463
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:14,817
I'll help you get her.

464
00:37:16,402 --> 00:37:19,697
Not for any of your future
shite, but for her.

465
00:37:19,864 --> 00:37:21,031
Fair enough.

466
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,326
But I'll tell you this.
You don't know Erik.

467
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:27,121
That man is a monster.
A murderer.

468
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:29,999
You think you can
convince Raven to change?

469
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:31,208
To come home?

470
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,043
That's splendid.

471
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:36,464
But what makes you think
you can change him?

472
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:40,217
Because you and Erik sent
me back here together.

473
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:44,555
<i>The room they're holding him in</i>

474
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:45,931
<i>was built during
the Second World War...</i>

475
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:47,641
<i>when there was
a shortage of steel.</i>

476
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:51,562
<i>So the foundation is pure
concrete and sand. No metal.</i>

477
00:37:51,729 --> 00:37:52,813
He's being held...

478
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,191
a hundred floors
beneath the most

479
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:57,568
heavily guarded
building on the planet.

480
00:37:57,735 --> 00:37:59,111
Why is he in there?

481
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:02,072
What, he forgot to mention?

482
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:05,284
Uh, JFK.

483
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:06,744
He killed...

484
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:11,749
What else explains a bullet
miraculously curving through the air?

485
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:13,542
Erik's always had
a way with guns.

486
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:15,387
Are you sure you want
to carry on with this?

487
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:16,796
This is your plan, not mine.

488
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:18,964
We don't have any
resources to get us in.

489
00:38:19,048 --> 00:38:20,716
Or out.

490
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:23,135
It's just me and Hank.

491
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:24,553
I knew a guy.

492
00:38:24,762 --> 00:38:26,180
Yeah, he'd be a young man now.

493
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:29,642
Grew up outside of D.C.

494
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:31,310
He could get into anywhere.

495
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:34,021
I just don't know how the hell
we're gonna find him.

496
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:38,025
Is Cerebro out of the question?

497
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:39,902
If only you guys had Internet.

498
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,406
What's "Internet?"

499
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,495
We have a phonebook.

500
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:58,170
I thought you'd be getting
ready for your trip, sir.

501
00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:00,256
I just came to
grab a couple files.

502
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:03,801
Is that a new scarf? It's nice.

503
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:05,094
Thank you.

504
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,436
Dr. Trask?

505
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:38,520
One second.

506
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,731
Oh.

507
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:43,609
We added some names
to the Paris meeting.

508
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,364
Thank you.

509
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:50,866
Is something wrong, sir?

510
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:53,953
No. It's nothing.

511
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:56,872
Would you mind
typing up my itinerary?

512
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:59,041
I don't wanna miss anything.

513
00:41:07,383 --> 00:41:08,842
- Here, here, here.
- Where?

514
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:10,386
Just stop here.
All right, all right.

515
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:12,638
Next time I'm driving.
Don't get used to it.

516
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,116
What's he done now?

517
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:33,909
I will just write you a
check for whatever he took.

518
00:41:34,076 --> 00:41:35,369
We just need to talk to him.

519
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:42,251
Peter! The cops are here. Again.

520
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:50,426
I'm a princess. What are you?

521
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:54,805
I'm the Wolverine.

522
00:41:55,723 --> 00:41:56,724
Where's your brother?

523
00:42:00,144 --> 00:42:02,438
Go upstairs and bug your sister.

524
00:42:02,521 --> 00:42:04,106
But she bugs me!

525
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:14,700
What do you guys want?

526
00:42:14,867 --> 00:42:17,536
I didn't do anything.
I've been here all day.

527
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:20,622
Just relax, Peter.
We're not cops.

528
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:21,832
Of course you're not.
If you were,

529
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:23,000
you wouldn't be
driving a rental car.

530
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:24,168
How did you know
we've got a rental car?

531
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:26,170
I checked your registration when
you were walking to the door.

532
00:42:26,295 --> 00:42:27,254
I also had some time to kill

533
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:28,338
so I went through
your rental agreement.

534
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:30,591
Saw you were from out of town.
Are you FBI?

535
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,677
No, you're not cops. Hey, what's
with this gifted youngsters place?

536
00:42:33,844 --> 00:42:36,180
That's an old card.

537
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:39,433
He's fascinating.
He's a pain in the arse.

538
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,768
What, a teleporter?

539
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:42,019
No, he's just fast.

540
00:42:42,144 --> 00:42:44,563
And when I knew him
he wasn't so... young.

541
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:47,232
Young? You're just old.

542
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:50,110
So you're not afraid
to show your powers?

543
00:42:50,277 --> 00:42:51,837
What powers? What
are you talking about?

544
00:42:52,613 --> 00:42:54,072
Do you see
something strange here?

545
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,367
Nothing anybody would
believe if you told them.

546
00:43:01,497 --> 00:43:03,040
So, who are you?
What do you want?

547
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:04,792
We need your help, Peter.
For what?

548
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:07,002
To break into a highly
secured facility...

549
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:08,712
and to get someone out.

550
00:43:08,879 --> 00:43:09,922
Prison break?

551
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:11,757
That's illegal, you know.

552
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:13,050
Um...

553
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:17,971
Well, only if you get caught.

554
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:19,181
So, what's in it for me?

555
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:22,643
You, you kleptomaniac, get
to break into the Pentagon.

556
00:43:28,565 --> 00:43:30,234
How do I know I can trust you?

557
00:43:31,235 --> 00:43:32,736
Because we're just like you.

558
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:36,240
Show him.

559
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,087
That's cool,
but it's disgusting.

560
00:43:51,922 --> 00:43:56,718
Built in 1943, the Pentagon is the
world's largest office building...

561
00:43:56,885 --> 00:43:59,763
housing more than
25,000 military employees...

562
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:01,515
stretched over six
million square feet.

563
00:44:01,598 --> 00:44:02,599
Where's the bathroom?

564
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,519
He always needs to pee!

565
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:10,751
Yeah, we're getting broadcast
signal down here. What's going on?

566
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:12,669
Damn it, call Maintenance,
get them down here.

567
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,395
...fought for and captured the island
of Iwo Jima from the Japanese Empire.

568
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:55,439
Now, this month-long battle...

569
00:46:55,605 --> 00:46:57,149
included some of
the fiercest fighting

570
00:46:57,274 --> 00:46:58,817
during World War
II in the Pacific...

571
00:47:14,624 --> 00:47:16,960
In three seconds, those
doors are going to open...

572
00:47:17,127 --> 00:47:19,463
and 20 guards will
be here to shoot us.

573
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:22,299
I know. That's what
I'm waiting for.

574
00:47:22,382 --> 00:47:23,467
What are you doing?

575
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,218
I'm holding your neck so
you don't get whiplash.

576
00:47:25,302 --> 00:47:26,303
What?

577
00:47:26,428 --> 00:47:28,638
Whiplash.

578
00:47:33,143 --> 00:47:34,478
Don't move!

579
00:47:49,493 --> 00:47:50,744
You're good, it'll pass.

580
00:47:50,827 --> 00:47:51,995
It happens with everyone.

581
00:47:54,498 --> 00:47:56,666
You must have done
something pretty serious.

582
00:47:56,792 --> 00:47:58,210
What did you do, man?

583
00:47:58,293 --> 00:48:01,638
What did you do? Why'd
they have you in there?

584
00:48:01,671 --> 00:48:03,465
For killing the President.

585
00:48:04,257 --> 00:48:07,427
Ah. Wow. Shit.

586
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:09,888
The only thing I'm guilty of

587
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:11,556
is fighting for people like us.

588
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:13,600
You take karate?
You know karate, man?

589
00:48:13,683 --> 00:48:15,811
I don't know karate.

590
00:48:15,977 --> 00:48:17,229
But I know crazy.

591
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:21,233
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and
girls, this is a Code Red situation.

592
00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:23,318
We are evacuating
the entire floor...

593
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:26,113
so that my associate and I...

594
00:48:26,196 --> 00:48:27,823
can, uh, secure the prison.

595
00:48:27,906 --> 00:48:29,407
Who are you?

596
00:48:29,533 --> 00:48:32,494
We're special operations, CB...
FB-CID.

597
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:35,413
Perhaps you didn't hear me
when first I spoke...

598
00:48:35,497 --> 00:48:37,332
but it is imperative
that you understand...

599
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:38,959
we're in a complete
lockdown situation.

600
00:48:39,042 --> 00:48:40,710
We have to get you
to the third floor...

601
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:49,803
Oh, I'm sorry.
Were you finished?

602
00:48:55,016 --> 00:48:56,893
They told me you control metal.

603
00:48:57,269 --> 00:48:58,478
"They"?

604
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:04,651
You know, my mom once knew
a guy who could do that.

605
00:49:07,237 --> 00:49:10,157
I'm sorry, I'm just not
very good with violence.

606
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:14,536
Charles?

607
00:49:21,251 --> 00:49:23,170
Good to see you too, old friend.

608
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:24,462
And walking.

609
00:49:24,588 --> 00:49:26,047
No thanks to you.

610
00:49:27,507 --> 00:49:29,968
You're the last person in the
world I expected to see today.

611
00:49:30,135 --> 00:49:31,428
Believe me...

612
00:49:31,595 --> 00:49:33,263
I wouldn't be here
if I didn't have to.

613
00:49:33,597 --> 00:49:35,599
If we get you out of here,
we do it my way.

614
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:36,766
No killing.

615
00:49:37,184 --> 00:49:38,185
No helmet.

616
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:40,770
I couldn't disobey
you even if I wanted.

617
00:49:40,937 --> 00:49:43,481
I'm never getting
inside of that head again.

618
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:46,776
I need your word, Erik.

619
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:51,114
Nobody move!

620
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,617
Hold it right there!

621
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,329
Charles. Don't move.

622
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,497
Hands up, or we will shoot!

623
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:01,291
Freeze them, Charles. I can't.

624
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:02,667
Hands up!

625
00:50:07,339 --> 00:50:08,423
No!

626
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:25,523
<i>If I could save time in a bottle.</i>

627
00:50:26,816 --> 00:50:31,696
<i>The first thing
that I'd like to do.</i>

628
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:34,407
<i>Is to save every day.</i>

629
00:50:34,491 --> 00:50:38,286
<i>Till eternity passes away.</i>

630
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:41,331
<i>Just to spend them with you.</i>

631
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:46,836
<i>If I could make days
last forever.</i>

632
00:50:47,921 --> 00:50:51,508
<i>If words could make
wishes come true.</i>

633
00:50:53,093 --> 00:50:55,679
<i>I'd save every day.</i>

634
00:50:55,762 --> 00:50:58,598
<i>Like a treasure and then.</i>

635
00:50:58,682 --> 00:51:03,061
<i>Again,
I would spend them with you.</i>

636
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:06,898
<i>But there never seems
to be enough time.</i>

637
00:51:06,982 --> 00:51:09,401
<i>To do the things you want to do.</i>

638
00:51:09,484 --> 00:51:12,153
<i>Once you find them.</i>

639
00:51:15,031 --> 00:51:17,367
<i>I've looked around
enough to know.</i>

640
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:22,163
<i>That you're the one I want
to go through time with.</i>

641
00:52:01,745 --> 00:52:03,246
Thanks, kid.

642
00:52:07,917 --> 00:52:09,961
Peter,
thank you very, very much.

643
00:52:10,128 --> 00:52:11,129
You take care.

644
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:12,547
Hey, I saw your
flight plan in the cockpit.

645
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:13,710
Why are you going to Paris?

646
00:52:25,268 --> 00:52:27,020
Imagine if they were metal.

647
00:52:28,438 --> 00:52:30,190
Do me a favor and return it for me.
Okay.

648
00:52:30,273 --> 00:52:31,608
And, Peter?

649
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:33,360
Take it slow.

650
00:52:34,486 --> 00:52:36,363
Where did they dig you up?

651
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:39,949
You're gonna find
this hard to believe...

652
00:52:41,201 --> 00:52:42,952
but, uh, you sent me.

653
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,288
You and Charles.

654
00:52:45,455 --> 00:52:47,040
From the future.

655
00:53:09,479 --> 00:53:11,648
How did you lose them?

656
00:53:11,815 --> 00:53:14,067
The treatment for my
spine affects my DNA.

657
00:53:16,903 --> 00:53:19,406
You sacrificed your powers
so you could walk?

658
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,410
I sacrificed my powers
so that I could sleep.

659
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:26,996
What do you know about it?

660
00:53:27,163 --> 00:53:28,415
I've lost my fair share.

661
00:53:28,498 --> 00:53:29,499
Ha.

662
00:53:29,916 --> 00:53:31,668
Dry your eyes, Erik.

663
00:53:31,835 --> 00:53:33,503
It doesn't justify
what you've done.

664
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:35,338
You have no idea what I've done.

665
00:53:35,505 --> 00:53:37,173
I know that you took the things
that mean the most to me.

666
00:53:37,507 --> 00:53:39,759
Well, maybe you should have
fought harder for them.

667
00:53:39,843 --> 00:53:41,136
If you want a fight, Erik...

668
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:42,762
Sit down.
...I will give you a fight!

669
00:53:42,846 --> 00:53:43,972
Let him come.

670
00:53:44,055 --> 00:53:45,807
You abandoned me!

671
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:48,268
You took her away...
and you abandoned me!

672
00:53:48,435 --> 00:53:49,853
Angel.

673
00:53:50,186 --> 00:53:51,521
Azazel.

674
00:53:52,188 --> 00:53:54,023
Emma.

675
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:55,567
Banshee.

676
00:53:56,526 --> 00:53:59,821
Mutant brothers and sisters...
all dead!

677
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:04,909
Countless others...
experimented on.

678
00:54:04,993 --> 00:54:06,035
Butchered!

679
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:07,120
Erik!

680
00:54:07,203 --> 00:54:08,329
Where were you, Charles?

681
00:54:08,705 --> 00:54:10,999
We were supposed
to protect them!

682
00:54:11,541 --> 00:54:13,877
Where were you when your
own people needed you?

683
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:16,129
Hiding! You and Hank!

684
00:54:16,546 --> 00:54:18,298
Pretending to be
something you're not!

685
00:54:18,882 --> 00:54:20,258
Erik!

686
00:54:22,093 --> 00:54:24,637
You abandoned us all.

687
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:46,993
So, you were always an asshole.

688
00:54:49,579 --> 00:54:52,123
I take it we're best
buddies in the future.

689
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,126
I spent a lot of years

690
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:56,920
trying to bring you down, bub.

691
00:54:57,504 --> 00:54:59,255
How does that work out for you?

692
00:54:59,422 --> 00:55:01,132
You're like me.

693
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,052
You're a survivor.

694
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:09,499
Do you wanna pick
all that shit up?

695
00:55:28,284 --> 00:55:32,830
General, maybe you should slow down,
we have a big day tomorrow.

696
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:39,504
We're celebrating, captain. It's not every day you
win a war, let alone against the American devils.

697
00:55:41,714 --> 00:55:43,341
I'm getting another bottle.

698
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,442
Excuse me.

699
00:56:02,652 --> 00:56:04,612
I'm pretty sure it was my fault.

700
00:56:04,988 --> 00:56:06,406
You speak Vietnamese.

701
00:56:06,656 --> 00:56:07,740
I'm an interpreter.

702
00:56:09,742 --> 00:56:12,245
I speak many tongues.

703
00:56:12,996 --> 00:56:15,164
Let me buy you another drink...

704
00:56:15,498 --> 00:56:17,584
unless you're here with someone.

705
00:56:18,293 --> 00:56:20,628
I'm alone.

706
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:24,173
A bottle of Johnnie Walker please.

707
00:56:38,938 --> 00:56:41,608
You're going to the Summit tomorrow?

708
00:56:46,696 --> 00:56:51,701
A pretty girl interested in politics...

709
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:54,370
Looks can be deceiving.

710
00:56:54,787 --> 00:56:56,247
Lady.

711
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,251
Show me more, baby?

712
00:57:02,045 --> 00:57:04,631
Clothes off?

713
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:21,105
What's the matter, baby? You don't
think I look pretty like this?

714
00:58:07,652 --> 00:58:10,446
Fancy a game? It's been a while.

715
00:58:10,613 --> 00:58:12,281
I'm not in the mood
for games, thank you.

716
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:22,083
I haven't had
a real sip in ten years.

717
00:58:34,887 --> 00:58:36,222
I didn't kill the President.

718
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:39,308
The bullet curved, Erik.

719
00:58:39,475 --> 00:58:40,977
Because I was
trying to save him.

720
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,063
They took me out before I could.

721
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:45,273
Why would you try and save him?

722
00:58:45,356 --> 00:58:47,984
Because he was one of us.

723
00:58:59,162 --> 00:59:01,581
You must think me so foolish.

724
00:59:03,166 --> 00:59:05,168
We've always said they
would come after us.

725
00:59:05,334 --> 00:59:08,671
I never imagined they'd
use Raven's DNA to do it.

726
00:59:09,547 --> 00:59:10,840
When did you last see her?

727
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:16,387
The day I left for Dallas.

728
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:18,681
And how was she?

729
00:59:20,683 --> 00:59:21,684
Strong.

730
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:23,561
Driven.

731
00:59:24,729 --> 00:59:25,772
Loyal.

732
00:59:25,855 --> 00:59:28,608
How... How was she?

733
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:31,527
She was...

734
00:59:33,279 --> 00:59:35,031
We were...

735
00:59:38,534 --> 00:59:40,870
I could see why she
meant so much to you.

736
00:59:43,456 --> 00:59:45,124
You should be proud
of her, Charles.

737
00:59:46,709 --> 00:59:48,586
She's out there
fighting for our cause.

738
00:59:48,753 --> 00:59:50,129
Your cause.

739
00:59:50,922 --> 00:59:53,716
The girl I raised was
not capable of killing.

740
00:59:53,883 --> 00:59:55,384
You didn't raise her,
you grew up with her.

741
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:57,595
She couldn't stay a little girl
forever, that's why she left.

742
00:59:57,762 --> 01:00:00,640
She left because you
got inside her head.

743
01:00:02,642 --> 01:00:04,560
That's not my power.

744
01:00:06,562 --> 01:00:07,897
She made a choice.

745
01:00:08,064 --> 01:00:10,900
But now we know where
that choice leads, don't we?

746
01:00:11,234 --> 01:00:12,485
She's going to murder Trask,

747
01:00:12,568 --> 01:00:13,808
they're going to capture her...

748
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:16,656
and then they're
going to wipe us out.

749
01:00:16,823 --> 01:00:18,741
Not if we get to her first.

750
01:00:19,951 --> 01:00:22,161
Not if we change
history tomorrow.

751
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:29,335
I'm sorry, Charles...

752
01:00:33,756 --> 01:00:34,757
for what happened.

753
01:00:35,591 --> 01:00:36,926
I truly am.

754
01:00:41,013 --> 01:00:42,413
It's been a while
since I've played.

755
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:46,811
I'll go easy on you.

756
01:00:48,688 --> 01:00:50,606
Might finally be a fair fight.

757
01:00:51,941 --> 01:00:53,317
You have the first move.

758
01:01:07,456 --> 01:01:10,167
<i>The diplomats from
all around the world</i>

759
01:01:10,251 --> 01:01:12,295
<i>are arriving here
today at the Hotel Royal.</i>

760
01:01:12,461 --> 01:01:13,880
<i>It's an historic day.</i>

761
01:01:14,046 --> 01:01:16,299
<i>It's the, uh, official ending</i>

762
01:01:16,382 --> 01:01:19,135
<i>of the United States' military
involvement in Vietnam.</i>

763
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:21,470
<i>There we have the South
Vietnamese Foreign Minister...</i>

764
01:01:21,637 --> 01:01:23,306
<i>with other South
Vietnamese dignitaries.</i>

765
01:01:24,223 --> 01:01:26,475
The Summit doesn't begin
for another hour.

766
01:01:26,642 --> 01:01:28,185
The hotel has arranged
a private room

767
01:01:28,269 --> 01:01:29,812
upstairs for
your special guests.

768
01:01:29,979 --> 01:01:31,939
That will be plenty of time.

769
01:01:36,068 --> 01:01:40,031
Good afternoon, everyone.
Hello, thank you for coming.

770
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:42,825
Congratulations on
winning this war.

771
01:01:43,326 --> 01:01:45,453
Now, I know you all
have hands to shake

772
01:01:45,536 --> 01:01:47,663
and photos to take downstairs...

773
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:49,874
so I will get
right to the point.

774
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:52,919
There is a new enemy out there.

775
01:01:53,085 --> 01:01:55,588
An enemy that will render
your arsenals useless...

776
01:01:55,755 --> 01:01:57,048
your armies powerless...

777
01:01:57,214 --> 01:01:59,091
and your nations defenseless.

778
01:02:04,847 --> 01:02:08,726
<i>You will need a new weapon for this war.
I call them Sentinels.</i>

779
01:02:10,561 --> 01:02:12,480
Named after
the ancient guardians

780
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:14,440
that stood at
the gates of the citadel.

781
01:02:16,692 --> 01:02:19,528
They have the aeronautic
capabilities of a Harrier jet.

782
01:02:20,529 --> 01:02:22,865
Armed with guns
that can fire off...

783
01:02:23,032 --> 01:02:27,036
<i>more than 2,000 rounds per minute
of thermoceramic ammunition.</i>

784
01:02:27,203 --> 01:02:29,705
But size, power, speed...

785
01:02:29,872 --> 01:02:31,791
You could find that
at Lockheed or Boeing.

786
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:34,460
No, what makes the
Sentinels so special...

787
01:02:34,627 --> 01:02:38,089
is the ability to target
the mutant X-gene.

788
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:39,757
A genetic guidance system

789
01:02:39,882 --> 01:02:42,426
that can lock onto a mark
a half a mile away.

790
01:02:42,593 --> 01:02:45,596
It won't trigger unless it
has identified the target.

791
01:02:45,763 --> 01:02:47,598
With this weapon, there will be

792
01:02:47,682 --> 01:02:49,308
no human collateral damage.

793
01:02:49,475 --> 01:02:52,311
If I turn it on, the system
couldn't even activate in here.

794
01:03:00,069 --> 01:03:03,906
Unless there's a mutant.

795
01:03:12,456 --> 01:03:15,167
There has to be
some kind of mistake.

796
01:03:16,794 --> 01:03:19,463
My machines don't make mistakes.

797
01:03:21,924 --> 01:03:23,300
What are you?

798
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:26,012
I assure you...

799
01:03:28,097 --> 01:03:29,098
No, don't shoot it.

800
01:03:29,765 --> 01:03:31,017
I assure you,

801
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:32,620
I don't know what
you're talking about.

802
01:04:07,053 --> 01:04:08,095
Raven!

803
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:15,394
Raven? Raven!

804
01:04:19,482 --> 01:04:20,816
Raven?

805
01:04:22,985 --> 01:04:24,153
Charles?

806
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,572
We've come for you, Erik and I.

807
01:04:26,739 --> 01:04:27,740
Together.

808
01:04:28,741 --> 01:04:30,910
I never thought
I'd see you again.

809
01:04:31,077 --> 01:04:33,329
I made you
a promise a long time ago

810
01:04:33,412 --> 01:04:34,538
that I would protect you.

811
01:04:42,296 --> 01:04:43,339
<i>Wolverine!</i>

812
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:48,761
I'm going to keep you safe.

813
01:04:48,928 --> 01:04:50,554
I'm going to keep you
out of their hands.

814
01:04:54,517 --> 01:04:55,851
Erik?

815
01:04:57,019 --> 01:04:59,188
Erik? What are you doing?

816
01:05:00,856 --> 01:05:02,399
Securing our future.

817
01:05:03,109 --> 01:05:04,527
Forgive me, Mystique.

818
01:05:04,902 --> 01:05:07,363
As long as you're out
there, we'll never be safe.

819
01:05:08,531 --> 01:05:11,742
Erik... Use your power, Charles.
Stop him.

820
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:13,035
He can't.

821
01:05:43,899 --> 01:05:45,401
He's slipping back.

822
01:05:45,568 --> 01:05:46,777
I'm losing him.

823
01:06:28,444 --> 01:06:29,486
<i>Stryker!</i>

824
01:06:29,945 --> 01:06:32,072
<i>Someone will finish
what we've started, Wolverine!</i>

825
01:06:32,156 --> 01:06:33,199
<i>One day!</i>

826
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:39,663
Restrain him.

827
01:06:54,803 --> 01:06:55,804
Erik!

828
01:07:05,981 --> 01:07:07,066
Where am I?

829
01:07:07,149 --> 01:07:08,192
Huh?

830
01:07:10,027 --> 01:07:11,320
How the hell did I get here?

831
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,072
What? You came to us.

832
01:07:14,073 --> 01:07:15,324
Who are you? Charles.

833
01:07:15,824 --> 01:07:16,992
Charles Xavier!

834
01:07:17,076 --> 01:07:18,077
I don't know you.

835
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,204
Huh? What the hell is that?

836
01:07:20,329 --> 01:07:23,707
Whoa. Whoa. Look, I can deal with this.
Just go.

837
01:07:23,999 --> 01:07:25,376
Stop Erik!

838
01:07:25,834 --> 01:07:28,170
Erik, please... I'm sorry.

839
01:07:28,337 --> 01:07:29,505
Erik...

840
01:07:48,274 --> 01:07:50,567
You're Logan, that's Hank
McCoy, I'm Charles Xavier.

841
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:53,195
You spent the last
couple of days with us.

842
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:58,200
You're on acid.

843
01:07:59,034 --> 01:08:03,080
Somebody gave you
really bad acid, yeah?

844
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:48,834
Just hold on tight,

845
01:08:48,917 --> 01:08:50,197
we'll get through this together.

846
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:52,921
Oh, my God, Kitty.

847
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:56,091
She's wounded pretty bad.

848
01:10:01,407 --> 01:10:02,491
I got him.

849
01:10:07,246 --> 01:10:08,247
Professor?

850
01:10:08,997 --> 01:10:10,082
What happened to you?

851
01:10:11,667 --> 01:10:13,001
I just saw someone who's gonna

852
01:10:13,085 --> 01:10:14,670
bring me a lot of pain someday.

853
01:10:17,506 --> 01:10:18,507
Where's Raven?

854
01:10:19,174 --> 01:10:20,426
Gone. What?

855
01:10:20,592 --> 01:10:22,636
We have to get out of here.

856
01:10:23,011 --> 01:10:25,251
We want to know if there's
any sort of connection with...

857
01:10:31,645 --> 01:10:33,313
<i>Yesterday,
the Paris Peace Summit...</i>

858
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:36,191
<i>was rocked by the appearance
of unidentified assailants...</i>

859
01:10:36,316 --> 01:10:38,652
<i>the likes of which
the world has never seen.</i>

860
01:10:38,819 --> 01:10:41,488
<i>Mass hysteria has gripped
the nation as people ask...</i>

861
01:10:41,655 --> 01:10:43,907
<i>"Where did they come from?
Will they be back?"</i>

862
01:10:44,074 --> 01:10:46,994
<i>And most importantly,
"Are they friend or foe?"</i>

863
01:10:47,161 --> 01:10:49,538
<i>That was London correspondent
Toby Elliot...</i>

864
01:10:49,621 --> 01:10:51,039
<i>reporting from the
Paris Peace Summit yesterday.</i>

865
01:10:51,123 --> 01:10:52,332
Fuck me.

866
01:10:54,918 --> 01:10:57,546
What the hell are we dealing with here?
Off the record.

867
01:10:58,338 --> 01:11:01,717
Two days ago, this man,
Erik Lehnsherr...

868
01:11:01,884 --> 01:11:04,386
escaped from a maximum security
prison inside the Pentagon.

869
01:11:04,553 --> 01:11:06,388
We believe that this woman

870
01:11:06,472 --> 01:11:08,265
is a former associate
of Lehnsherr's.

871
01:11:08,599 --> 01:11:09,850
They were together in Cuba,

872
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:12,352
the day of the crisis in '62.

873
01:11:12,519 --> 01:11:16,190
He was also implicated
in Kennedy's assassination.

874
01:11:17,316 --> 01:11:18,692
What about that thing?

875
01:11:18,859 --> 01:11:20,360
We don't know what
that thing is, sir.

876
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:22,821
Actually, we really don't
know what any of them are.

877
01:11:22,988 --> 01:11:25,532
Yes. Yes, we do.

878
01:11:26,366 --> 01:11:27,784
They're mutants.

879
01:11:29,161 --> 01:11:33,123
He has the power
to control metal.

880
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:34,541
Last I checked, that's what

881
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:36,126
most of your weapons
were made of.

882
01:11:36,335 --> 01:11:40,172
And she can transform
into anyone.

883
01:11:40,339 --> 01:11:43,133
A general, a secret serviceman.

884
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:44,551
Even you, Mr. President.

885
01:11:45,219 --> 01:11:46,539
She could walk
into this office...

886
01:11:46,637 --> 01:11:50,307
and order a nuclear strike
if she was in the mood.

887
01:11:50,474 --> 01:11:52,059
And that's only two of them.

888
01:11:52,226 --> 01:11:55,229
Do we have any countermeasures?
Any defense?

889
01:11:55,395 --> 01:11:57,648
I was waiting for you
to ask me that question.

890
01:11:57,981 --> 01:12:01,735
That's an experimental program, sir.
Strictly off the books.

891
01:12:10,536 --> 01:12:13,205
You're telling me these mutants
are out in the world...

892
01:12:13,372 --> 01:12:15,832
and our best defense
are these giant metal robots?

893
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:18,043
Many of the mutants
look like us.

894
01:12:18,502 --> 01:12:20,671
My Sentinels can
tell the difference.

895
01:12:20,921 --> 01:12:23,215
I have eight prototypes
ready to go.

896
01:12:23,382 --> 01:12:25,300
They're built out of
a space-age polymer,

897
01:12:25,384 --> 01:12:27,052
not an ounce of metal on them.

898
01:12:33,684 --> 01:12:35,018
I want to make a demonstration.

899
01:12:35,185 --> 01:12:37,437
I want the world to know
that we can protect them.

900
01:12:38,021 --> 01:12:39,648
What do you need to get
these things operational?

901
01:12:39,815 --> 01:12:41,358
I already gave that
number to Congress.

902
01:12:41,525 --> 01:12:44,278
Unfortunately, they
elected to shut me down.

903
01:12:44,444 --> 01:12:47,030
It's going to cost a bit
more to turn them on.

904
01:12:47,197 --> 01:12:50,200
- Whatever you need.
- Oh, and one more thing.

905
01:12:50,367 --> 01:12:53,787
If we do manage to capture
them, I would like her.

906
01:12:53,954 --> 01:12:55,872
For research purposes,
of course.

907
01:12:56,123 --> 01:12:59,793
I don't care who you screw,
as long as it's not me.

908
01:13:03,797 --> 01:13:05,173
Terrible thing.

909
01:13:06,341 --> 01:13:07,759
<i>What is?</i>

910
01:13:08,343 --> 01:13:09,636
Being born like that.

911
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:10,846
Is it?

912
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:13,473
Can you imagine...

913
01:13:13,724 --> 01:13:16,393
Looking in the mirror and seeing that
staring back at you?

914
01:13:17,477 --> 01:13:20,230
Yes, I can.

915
01:13:22,482 --> 01:13:25,110
Where do you think she comes from?

916
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:28,155
You think she has a family?

917
01:13:29,823 --> 01:13:31,366
Yes.

918
01:13:31,533 --> 01:13:33,368
She does.

919
01:14:21,083 --> 01:14:23,126
If I see so much
as a screw move,

920
01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:25,212
I will jam this
into your throat.

921
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:27,547
How did you find me?

922
01:14:27,714 --> 01:14:29,216
You taught me well.

923
01:14:29,383 --> 01:14:31,718
It's been a long time
since we were this close.

924
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:34,596
I missed you.

925
01:14:34,763 --> 01:14:36,431
You tried to kill me.

926
01:14:36,598 --> 01:14:38,725
So the rest of us could live.

927
01:14:40,227 --> 01:14:41,478
What do you mean?

928
01:14:42,062 --> 01:14:44,064
We received a message
from the future.

929
01:14:44,231 --> 01:14:46,149
Don't lie to me.

930
01:14:46,775 --> 01:14:48,777
I never have, and I never will.

931
01:14:50,404 --> 01:14:52,823
Humans use your blood,
your genes,

932
01:14:52,906 --> 01:14:55,283
to create a weapon
that wipes us all out.

933
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:56,868
I was only doing what I thought

934
01:14:56,952 --> 01:14:58,912
necessary to secure our future.

935
01:14:59,079 --> 01:15:00,372
So what's to stop me
from killing you

936
01:15:00,455 --> 01:15:02,249
right now and
securing my future?

937
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:04,418
Nothing.

938
01:15:05,669 --> 01:15:07,587
It doesn't matter anymore.

939
01:15:07,754 --> 01:15:10,590
They have your DNA. Your
blood was on the street.

940
01:15:11,258 --> 01:15:12,592
Whose fault was that?

941
01:15:14,261 --> 01:15:15,679
Mine.

942
01:15:16,596 --> 01:15:19,933
I've seen their plans.
They're creating a weapon.

943
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:23,019
And now they have what they
need to take it further.

944
01:15:25,313 --> 01:15:28,650
We have to strike now, while
we still hold the upper hand.

945
01:15:31,486 --> 01:15:33,530
I've seen too many
friends die, Erik.

946
01:15:35,615 --> 01:15:37,868
I don't want a war.

947
01:15:37,951 --> 01:15:39,786
I only want the man
who murdered them.

948
01:15:39,953 --> 01:15:41,455
This is war.

949
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:45,125
What happened to you?

950
01:15:45,959 --> 01:15:48,211
Did you lose your way
while I was gone?

951
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:52,299
Are you still Charles' Raven?

952
01:15:54,634 --> 01:15:57,053
Or are you Mystique?

953
01:16:00,474 --> 01:16:02,017
Trask is the enemy.

954
01:16:04,186 --> 01:16:06,229
Killing one man isn't enough.

955
01:16:06,646 --> 01:16:07,981
It never was for you.

956
01:16:09,357 --> 01:16:10,567
Goodbye, Erik.

957
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:36,968
What happened?

958
01:16:37,052 --> 01:16:38,678
Come on. Can he walk?

959
01:16:38,845 --> 01:16:40,013
He needs his treatment.

960
01:16:40,514 --> 01:16:41,640
Hank, I can hear them.

961
01:16:41,723 --> 01:16:42,849
I know. It's okay.

962
01:16:43,016 --> 01:16:45,060
Can you make it stop?
I'll get them.

963
01:16:47,062 --> 01:16:48,188
Hey, hey.

964
01:16:48,313 --> 01:16:50,023
Pull yourself together.

965
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:51,691
It's not over yet.

966
01:16:54,861 --> 01:16:56,238
You don't believe that.

967
01:16:58,156 --> 01:16:59,533
How do you know?

968
01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:01,368
As these go...

969
01:17:03,078 --> 01:17:06,373
this comes back.

970
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,376
They all come back.

971
01:17:14,548 --> 01:17:15,966
Look.

972
01:17:16,716 --> 01:17:18,385
I'm still here...

973
01:17:19,427 --> 01:17:20,929
and she's still out there.

974
01:17:23,098 --> 01:17:25,225
We need your help, Charles.

975
01:17:25,809 --> 01:17:27,394
Not like this. I need you.

976
01:17:27,852 --> 01:17:31,106
We can't find Raven.
Not without your powers.

977
01:17:34,734 --> 01:17:37,070
I added a little extra
because you missed a dose.

978
01:17:42,742 --> 01:17:43,910
Charles.

979
01:18:15,275 --> 01:18:17,402
Hank, do me a favor.

980
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:20,405
Would you help me
to my study, please?

981
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:27,162
Come on, I got you.

982
01:18:37,297 --> 01:18:39,591
Are you sure about this?

983
01:18:40,967 --> 01:18:43,094
Absolutely not.

984
01:18:49,643 --> 01:18:51,811
This creature is extraordinary.

985
01:18:53,021 --> 01:18:54,648
Her genes could hold the key

986
01:18:54,731 --> 01:18:56,775
to mutation itself.

987
01:18:56,858 --> 01:18:57,942
I need more.

988
01:18:58,026 --> 01:19:00,862
That's all they were able to
scrape off the pavement in Paris.

989
01:19:01,029 --> 01:19:02,197
More than blood.

990
01:19:02,697 --> 01:19:04,491
I need brain tissue...

991
01:19:04,658 --> 01:19:07,285
spinal fluid, bone marrow.

992
01:19:08,411 --> 01:19:11,206
Imagine... Sentinels
that could transform,

993
01:19:11,289 --> 01:19:12,540
adapt to any target.

994
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:15,460
If I could just get
my hands on her.

995
01:19:15,627 --> 01:19:17,462
This girl could leap

996
01:19:17,545 --> 01:19:19,297
the program forward years...

997
01:19:19,464 --> 01:19:21,341
decades into the future.

998
01:19:22,676 --> 01:19:23,968
How old is your son now, Major?

999
01:19:25,303 --> 01:19:26,388
Jason?

1000
01:19:26,554 --> 01:19:28,556
He's coming up on ten now,
if you can believe it.

1001
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,141
Eight years from fighting age.

1002
01:19:30,392 --> 01:19:32,227
And how many of
our sons and brothers

1003
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:34,062
did we just ship
home in body bags?

1004
01:19:34,229 --> 01:19:36,189
Maybe fifty,
fifty-five thousand?

1005
01:19:36,356 --> 01:19:37,816
And how many more
on the other side?

1006
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:44,364
Never before... in all
of human history...

1007
01:19:44,531 --> 01:19:49,202
has there been a cause which
could unite us as a species.

1008
01:19:50,203 --> 01:19:52,539
Until now.

1009
01:19:53,832 --> 01:19:55,834
You really hate,
mutants, don't you?

1010
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,337
On the contrary,
I rather admire them.

1011
01:19:59,504 --> 01:20:00,588
The things they can do.

1012
01:20:02,257 --> 01:20:05,218
I see mutants as our salvation.

1013
01:20:05,385 --> 01:20:06,553
A common enemy.

1014
01:20:07,387 --> 01:20:10,515
A common struggle
against the ultimate enemy.

1015
01:20:11,182 --> 01:20:13,059
Extinction.

1016
01:20:13,518 --> 01:20:14,638
I believe our new friends...

1017
01:20:14,686 --> 01:20:17,063
are going to help us
usher in a new era, Bill.

1018
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:19,566
A new era of genuine...

1019
01:20:19,733 --> 01:20:22,485
and long-lasting peace.

1020
01:20:36,458 --> 01:20:37,917
<i>Attention, attention.</i>

1021
01:20:38,001 --> 01:20:39,878
<i>Transport departure
in two hours.</i>

1022
01:20:40,044 --> 01:20:44,048
<i>Repeat. Transport
departure in two hours.</i>

1023
01:20:50,221 --> 01:20:53,016
When was the last time
you were down here?

1024
01:20:53,224 --> 01:20:54,601
The last time we went
looking for students.

1025
01:20:54,893 --> 01:20:56,603
A lifetime ago.

1026
01:21:02,484 --> 01:21:04,652
<i>Welcome, Professor.</i>

1027
01:21:28,134 --> 01:21:30,345
Raven's wounded.
She won't be moving fast.

1028
01:21:38,770 --> 01:21:41,105
These are muscles I haven't
stretched in a long time.

1029
01:22:24,691 --> 01:22:25,692
Charles!

1030
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:29,237
Charles!

1031
01:22:37,161 --> 01:22:39,956
Charles? It's all right.

1032
01:22:42,542 --> 01:22:44,335
I'll go check the generator.

1033
01:22:52,093 --> 01:22:53,678
It's not the machinery, is it?

1034
01:22:54,512 --> 01:22:57,265
I can't do this. My mind...
Yes, you can.

1035
01:22:57,390 --> 01:22:59,183
It won't take it.
You're just a little rusty.

1036
01:22:59,267 --> 01:23:01,728
You don't understand. It's not
a question of being rusty.

1037
01:23:01,895 --> 01:23:03,695
I can flip the switches.
I can turn the knobs.

1038
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:07,358
But my power comes from here.
It comes from...

1039
01:23:08,067 --> 01:23:09,736
And it's broken.

1040
01:23:10,862 --> 01:23:12,780
I feel like one of my students.

1041
01:23:13,072 --> 01:23:14,365
Helpless.

1042
01:23:15,742 --> 01:23:17,062
It was a mistake
coming down here.

1043
01:23:17,118 --> 01:23:18,661
It was a mistake freeing Erik.

1044
01:23:18,745 --> 01:23:21,122
This whole thing has
been one bloody mistake.

1045
01:23:21,205 --> 01:23:23,708
I'm sorry, Logan, but they
sent back the wrong man.

1046
01:23:24,542 --> 01:23:25,960
You're right.

1047
01:23:27,295 --> 01:23:28,796
I am.

1048
01:23:29,714 --> 01:23:31,215
Actually, it was
supposed to be you.

1049
01:23:32,258 --> 01:23:35,803
But I was the only one who could
physically make the trip.

1050
01:23:36,471 --> 01:23:37,597
And, uh...

1051
01:23:37,931 --> 01:23:39,515
And I don't know
how long I've got here.

1052
01:23:39,974 --> 01:23:42,769
But I do know that
a long time ago...

1053
01:23:43,394 --> 01:23:45,772
actually, a long
time from now...

1054
01:23:46,105 --> 01:23:49,275
I was your most
helpless student.

1055
01:23:49,734 --> 01:23:52,111
And you unlocked my mind.

1056
01:23:52,278 --> 01:23:54,948
You showed me what I was.

1057
01:23:55,114 --> 01:23:56,950
You showed me what I could be.

1058
01:23:57,116 --> 01:23:59,118
I don't know how
to do that for you.

1059
01:23:59,285 --> 01:24:01,245
You're right. I don't.

1060
01:24:03,122 --> 01:24:05,166
But I know someone who might.

1061
01:24:05,625 --> 01:24:07,210
Hmm.

1062
01:24:07,293 --> 01:24:10,254
Look into my mind.

1063
01:24:10,463 --> 01:24:12,715
You saw what I did to Cerebro.

1064
01:24:12,799 --> 01:24:14,050
You don't want me
inside your head.

1065
01:24:14,133 --> 01:24:15,218
There's no damage you can do...

1066
01:24:15,301 --> 01:24:16,861
that hasn't already
been done. Trust me.

1067
01:24:16,970 --> 01:24:17,971
Come on.

1068
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,483
Hey.

1069
01:24:32,402 --> 01:24:33,444
Hey, Logan.

1070
01:24:33,528 --> 01:24:34,529
Hi, Jean.

1071
01:24:34,988 --> 01:24:36,072
Kill me.

1072
01:24:36,155 --> 01:24:37,156
I love you.

1073
01:24:40,451 --> 01:24:44,914
You poor, poor man.

1074
01:24:44,998 --> 01:24:46,165
Look past me.

1075
01:24:46,332 --> 01:24:48,167
No, I don't want your suffering.

1076
01:24:48,334 --> 01:24:50,253
I don't want your future!

1077
01:24:50,336 --> 01:24:52,463
Look past my future.

1078
01:24:52,714 --> 01:24:54,841
Look for your future.

1079
01:24:58,344 --> 01:24:59,679
That's it.

1080
01:25:00,054 --> 01:25:01,305
That's it.

1081
01:25:03,016 --> 01:25:04,350
That's it.

1082
01:25:52,273 --> 01:25:54,233
Charles.

1083
01:25:56,069 --> 01:25:57,445
Charles.

1084
01:26:01,699 --> 01:26:04,077
So this is what becomes of us.

1085
01:26:05,369 --> 01:26:07,205
Erik was right.

1086
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:10,083
Humanity does this to us.

1087
01:26:10,249 --> 01:26:12,877
Not if we show
them a better path.

1088
01:26:13,795 --> 01:26:15,463
You still believe?

1089
01:26:15,630 --> 01:26:18,091
Just because someone
stumbles, loses their way...

1090
01:26:18,257 --> 01:26:21,094
it doesn't mean
they're lost forever.

1091
01:26:21,719 --> 01:26:25,473
Sometimes we all need
a little help.

1092
01:26:26,432 --> 01:26:28,101
Oh, I'm not the man I was.

1093
01:26:30,269 --> 01:26:32,313
I open my mind...

1094
01:26:32,897 --> 01:26:35,108
and it almost overwhelms me.

1095
01:26:35,441 --> 01:26:38,945
You're afraid,
and Cerebro knows it.

1096
01:26:40,113 --> 01:26:42,657
All those voices...

1097
01:26:44,408 --> 01:26:49,080
so much pain.

1098
01:26:49,455 --> 01:26:52,792
It's not their pain
you're afraid of.

1099
01:26:52,959 --> 01:26:54,961
It's yours, Charles.

1100
01:26:56,254 --> 01:26:58,756
And as frightening
as it may be...

1101
01:26:58,923 --> 01:27:01,759
that pain will
make you stronger.

1102
01:27:02,093 --> 01:27:05,138
If you allow
yourself to feel it...

1103
01:27:05,304 --> 01:27:07,014
embrace it...

1104
01:27:08,182 --> 01:27:10,059
it will make you more powerful

1105
01:27:10,143 --> 01:27:12,353
than you ever imagined.

1106
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:15,857
It's the greatest
gift we have...

1107
01:27:16,023 --> 01:27:19,861
to bear their pain
without breaking.

1108
01:27:20,027 --> 01:27:24,365
And it's born... from
the most human power.

1109
01:27:25,366 --> 01:27:26,951
Hope.

1110
01:27:36,043 --> 01:27:38,379
Please, Charles...

1111
01:27:38,546 --> 01:27:42,508
we need you to hope again.

1112
01:27:50,808 --> 01:27:53,269
Find what you were looking for?

1113
01:27:59,066 --> 01:28:00,359
The power's back on.

1114
01:28:00,526 --> 01:28:01,819
Yes.

1115
01:28:02,862 --> 01:28:04,572
Yes, it is.

1116
01:29:44,964 --> 01:29:46,424
She's lost too much blood.

1117
01:29:47,049 --> 01:29:48,384
She can't keep going like this.

1118
01:29:48,551 --> 01:29:50,678
We have no choice, Bobby.

1119
01:29:50,845 --> 01:29:52,221
We can wake him up. No!

1120
01:29:53,806 --> 01:29:55,099
They need more time.

1121
01:29:55,641 --> 01:29:57,685
I had...

1122
01:29:58,269 --> 01:30:00,271
a glimpse into the past.

1123
01:30:00,438 --> 01:30:01,814
If we wake Logan now...

1124
01:30:01,981 --> 01:30:05,401
we may set our fate
on an even darker course.

1125
01:30:05,609 --> 01:30:07,361
They need more time.

1126
01:30:09,613 --> 01:30:11,574
There is someone else.

1127
01:30:11,657 --> 01:30:13,409
No, no one has Kitty's power.

1128
01:30:13,492 --> 01:30:15,661
Someone that could
take her power,

1129
01:30:15,745 --> 01:30:17,204
take her place.

1130
01:30:18,581 --> 01:30:19,874
She took yours once.

1131
01:30:19,999 --> 01:30:20,999
Rogue.

1132
01:30:21,042 --> 01:30:23,586
I'm sorry, Bobby,
she must be dead.

1133
01:30:23,669 --> 01:30:24,837
I haven't been able to make

1134
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,255
a connection with her for years.

1135
01:30:26,339 --> 01:30:27,548
That's because
they're keeping her

1136
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:29,675
in the one place
your mind can't reach

1137
01:30:29,759 --> 01:30:31,260
from the outside.

1138
01:30:31,344 --> 01:30:33,554
She's in Cerebro.

1139
01:30:33,763 --> 01:30:35,431
She's in your house, Professor.

1140
01:30:36,057 --> 01:30:37,224
They're experimenting on her.

1141
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:40,436
Trying to tap into her power,
so they can take ours.

1142
01:30:40,519 --> 01:30:41,520
Take all of ours.

1143
01:30:41,604 --> 01:30:43,404
If you knew this, why
didn't you go after her?

1144
01:30:43,481 --> 01:30:46,192
We tried. It's too
heavily guarded.

1145
01:30:46,317 --> 01:30:47,401
I may know a few things

1146
01:30:47,485 --> 01:30:49,945
about that house they don't.

1147
01:30:56,118 --> 01:30:58,537
Kitty, I'm going to get help.

1148
01:30:58,704 --> 01:31:00,873
I'm gonna bring back
somebody to help you.

1149
01:31:03,709 --> 01:31:06,587
Please, just bring
yourself back.

1150
01:31:30,736 --> 01:31:32,196
Raven, stop.

1151
01:31:33,155 --> 01:31:34,782
Stop running.

1152
01:31:35,116 --> 01:31:36,283
Charles?

1153
01:31:38,327 --> 01:31:39,411
Where are you?

1154
01:31:39,495 --> 01:31:42,581
Back at the house...
where you should be.

1155
01:31:42,748 --> 01:31:44,917
I need you to come home.

1156
01:31:45,626 --> 01:31:47,461
I know what I need to do.

1157
01:31:51,132 --> 01:31:52,341
If you kill Trask...

1158
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:54,593
you will be creating countless
more just like him.

1159
01:31:55,261 --> 01:31:56,345
Then I'll kill them, too.

1160
01:31:56,470 --> 01:31:58,973
Those are Erik's words,
not yours.

1161
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:01,517
Oh!

1162
01:32:02,643 --> 01:32:05,146
The girl I grew up with
wasn't capable of killing.

1163
01:32:05,271 --> 01:32:08,983
She was good... fair,
full of compassion.

1164
01:32:10,317 --> 01:32:12,069
I have compassion.

1165
01:32:12,153 --> 01:32:13,654
Just not for Trask.

1166
01:32:13,779 --> 01:32:15,447
He's murdered too many of us.

1167
01:32:20,161 --> 01:32:21,287
Shut her down, Charles.
Get in her head.

1168
01:32:21,453 --> 01:32:22,913
She's not letting me in.

1169
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:26,292
I'm barely holding on.
I'm not strong enough yet.

1170
01:32:34,425 --> 01:32:36,302
I know what Trask has done...

1171
01:32:36,635 --> 01:32:38,971
but killing him
will not bring them back.

1172
01:32:39,638 --> 01:32:40,758
It will set you on a path...

1173
01:32:40,806 --> 01:32:42,808
from which there is no return.

1174
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:45,227
An endless cycle of killing.

1175
01:32:45,394 --> 01:32:49,148
Us and them, until
there is nothing left.

1176
01:32:49,982 --> 01:32:53,986
But we can stop it,
right now, you and I.

1177
01:32:54,904 --> 01:32:57,907
You just have to come home.

1178
01:32:59,283 --> 01:33:01,076
I have to?

1179
01:33:01,452 --> 01:33:02,912
You haven't changed
at all, Charles.

1180
01:33:04,246 --> 01:33:05,331
Like I said...

1181
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:07,833
I know exactly
what I have to do.

1182
01:33:10,002 --> 01:33:11,503
You do?

1183
01:33:13,505 --> 01:33:16,425
Then, wherever you go,
I will find you.

1184
01:33:16,842 --> 01:33:20,679
And, Raven, if you make
me, I will stop you.

1185
01:33:22,181 --> 01:33:23,515
Good luck, Charles.

1186
01:33:36,987 --> 01:33:37,988
Where is she?

1187
01:33:38,155 --> 01:33:40,241
She's in an airport,
boarding a plane.

1188
01:33:40,324 --> 01:33:41,659
She could be going anywhere.

1189
01:33:45,329 --> 01:33:47,122
Get some rest, Charles.

1190
01:33:47,206 --> 01:33:48,457
We'll track her in the
morning and find out

1191
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:50,751
exactly where she's going.

1192
01:33:54,004 --> 01:33:56,173
<i>...rockets did land
outside the base,</i>

1193
01:33:56,257 --> 01:33:59,009
<i>killing five civilians
and wounding 12 others.</i>

1194
01:34:00,970 --> 01:34:01,971
Yeah?

1195
01:34:05,766 --> 01:34:08,143
You know that those things
can give you cancer?

1196
01:34:08,227 --> 01:34:11,480
I've done some toxicology
tests in the lab, and...

1197
01:34:16,568 --> 01:34:17,903
You want something?

1198
01:34:19,071 --> 01:34:20,698
Yeah, I'm...

1199
01:34:22,241 --> 01:34:23,534
I know it's complicated,

1200
01:34:23,617 --> 01:34:25,160
and there's probably
all kinds of rules

1201
01:34:25,244 --> 01:34:27,162
and reasons for what
you can and can't say,

1202
01:34:28,539 --> 01:34:30,457
but I was wondering
if you could tell me

1203
01:34:31,834 --> 01:34:34,753
in the future, do I make it?

1204
01:34:35,421 --> 01:34:36,505
No.

1205
01:34:37,965 --> 01:34:38,966
Oh.

1206
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:40,801
Okay.

1207
01:34:42,803 --> 01:34:44,430
It's okay. Thanks.

1208
01:34:44,513 --> 01:34:45,514
Hey, kid?

1209
01:34:48,559 --> 01:34:50,477
It's just the world I came from.

1210
01:35:00,446 --> 01:35:02,281
We're going backwards in time.

1211
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:14,793
Tomorrow, in front
of the White House,

1212
01:35:14,877 --> 01:35:16,545
the President will
make his announcement.

1213
01:35:16,628 --> 01:35:18,756
He will be joined by
Secretary of Defense Laird...

1214
01:35:18,881 --> 01:35:20,257
and has even sought the help

1215
01:35:20,341 --> 01:35:22,509
of renowned scientist
Bolivar Trask...

1216
01:35:22,676 --> 01:35:25,220
his special advisor to
combat this mutant issue.

1217
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:27,890
The White House has
asked all three networks

1218
01:35:27,973 --> 01:35:29,350
to air the event live,

1219
01:35:29,433 --> 01:35:31,727
as it is a matter of importance

1220
01:35:31,810 --> 01:35:33,187
not only to the United States,

1221
01:35:33,270 --> 01:35:35,731
but to every citizen
from around the globe.

1222
01:35:35,814 --> 01:35:37,608
There are no other details
about the event...

1223
01:35:46,658 --> 01:35:47,951
Raven...

1224
01:35:48,702 --> 01:35:50,579
My God.

1225
01:35:51,455 --> 01:35:53,207
I don't understand.
What are you doing here?

1226
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:56,335
I, uh...

1227
01:35:57,211 --> 01:35:58,921
I guess, I just realized

1228
01:35:59,004 --> 01:36:01,090
I have nowhere else to go.

1229
01:36:03,175 --> 01:36:04,968
I've gotta wake Charles...
No, don't.

1230
01:36:05,677 --> 01:36:07,012
Just wait.

1231
01:36:21,610 --> 01:36:24,655
You really shouldn't
walk on this.

1232
01:36:24,738 --> 01:36:27,282
I've had worse.

1233
01:36:27,366 --> 01:36:30,411
So, you've been living
here all these years?

1234
01:36:30,494 --> 01:36:32,162
Someone had to
take care of Charles.

1235
01:36:33,705 --> 01:36:36,625
You know, he's missed you.

1236
01:36:36,792 --> 01:36:39,878
He misses who I was.

1237
01:36:40,879 --> 01:36:45,217
I'm not who he wants
me to be anymore.

1238
01:36:47,761 --> 01:36:49,471
I've missed you.

1239
01:36:51,348 --> 01:36:53,767
So, you're like this
all the time now.

1240
01:36:53,851 --> 01:36:54,852
Like what?

1241
01:36:55,352 --> 01:36:56,353
This.

1242
01:36:58,689 --> 01:37:00,441
No, not all the time.

1243
01:37:00,524 --> 01:37:02,609
I take a shot in the morning,

1244
01:37:02,693 --> 01:37:04,278
and I need another
if I get worked up.

1245
01:37:05,195 --> 01:37:07,030
Worked up?

1246
01:37:07,114 --> 01:37:08,782
Yeah, yeah, when I'm...

1247
01:37:08,949 --> 01:37:12,453
...emotional or excited.

1248
01:37:14,455 --> 01:37:17,708
Any animal urges.

1249
01:37:18,250 --> 01:37:19,251
Hmm.

1250
01:37:20,586 --> 01:37:22,337
Usually, I can fight them off.

1251
01:37:22,504 --> 01:37:24,184
Well, maybe, we shouldn't
have to fight off

1252
01:37:24,256 --> 01:37:26,049
the things that
come naturally to us.

1253
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:02,920
Do you remember one of the
last things you said to me?

1254
01:38:04,129 --> 01:38:07,841
That I would never be deemed
beautiful, looking like this?

1255
01:38:10,969 --> 01:38:13,305
Do you still think that?

1256
01:38:13,472 --> 01:38:16,308
Maybe. You saw
what happened in Paris.

1257
01:38:17,809 --> 01:38:19,728
You know what they think of us.

1258
01:38:21,021 --> 01:38:22,397
What do you think?

1259
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:32,407
I think you're beautiful.

1260
01:38:33,075 --> 01:38:34,826
What about yourself?

1261
01:38:42,584 --> 01:38:45,212
You should get some rest.

1262
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:49,633
I'm glad you're home.

1263
01:38:55,722 --> 01:38:57,182
Hank?

1264
01:38:58,350 --> 01:39:01,478
Do you remember the last
thing I said to you?

1265
01:39:05,482 --> 01:39:08,610
It was, "Mutant and proud."

1266
01:39:35,846 --> 01:39:40,058
<i>The old gas and water pipes
lead straight to the house.</i>

1267
01:39:45,981 --> 01:39:48,442
<i>The walls are made
of reinforced steel.</i>

1268
01:39:48,525 --> 01:39:50,444
In other words, a door.

1269
01:40:02,039 --> 01:40:05,417
<i>You're walking
directly over the hall now.</i>

1270
01:40:58,095 --> 01:41:00,180
I've been on that slab.

1271
01:41:00,263 --> 01:41:02,182
Let me show you how it feels.

1272
01:41:08,772 --> 01:41:10,941
Rogue, Rogue, come on. Wake up.

1273
01:41:14,486 --> 01:41:15,737
Rogue.

1274
01:41:16,822 --> 01:41:19,282
Come on, Rogue, wake up.
Wake up, it's me.

1275
01:41:27,791 --> 01:41:28,792
No.

1276
01:41:51,857 --> 01:41:54,860
Rogue, Rogue, Rogue,
it's okay. He's with me.

1277
01:41:54,985 --> 01:41:56,265
We're gonna get you out of here.

1278
01:42:17,007 --> 01:42:18,175
<i>Erik, Bobby.</i>

1279
01:42:18,383 --> 01:42:19,885
<i>Get out of there! Now!</i>

1280
01:42:38,153 --> 01:42:39,154
Take her!

1281
01:42:39,738 --> 01:42:41,490
Bobby! No!

1282
01:42:44,367 --> 01:42:45,368
Bobby!

1283
01:42:59,591 --> 01:43:00,759
Bobby!

1284
01:43:35,252 --> 01:43:36,336
Professor!

1285
01:43:38,171 --> 01:43:39,965
Get us out of here.

1286
01:43:40,048 --> 01:43:41,883
Bobby. I know.

1287
01:45:20,231 --> 01:45:21,983
I'm sorry, Charles.

1288
01:45:50,595 --> 01:45:52,263
Where's Bobby?

1289
01:45:54,224 --> 01:45:55,934
I'm sorry, Kitty.

1290
01:46:32,971 --> 01:46:34,097
Hello, Logan.

1291
01:46:43,898 --> 01:46:44,899
Rogue.

1292
01:46:47,986 --> 01:46:49,320
Raven was here.

1293
01:46:49,487 --> 01:46:51,031
I screwed up. Shit.

1294
01:47:03,043 --> 01:47:04,502
We can't track her now.

1295
01:47:06,796 --> 01:47:08,423
She's cut her ties.

1296
01:47:11,301 --> 01:47:13,136
Hey, I saw in the
news last night

1297
01:47:13,219 --> 01:47:15,597
there's going to be an announcement
in Washington this afternoon

1298
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:17,932
about a new
protocol for mutants.

1299
01:47:20,101 --> 01:47:22,103
I set the system I designed...

1300
01:47:22,187 --> 01:47:24,564
to record any news about Paris
over all three networks...

1301
01:47:24,939 --> 01:47:26,024
and PBS.

1302
01:47:26,441 --> 01:47:28,026
All three? Wow.

1303
01:47:28,318 --> 01:47:30,028
Yeah, and PBS.

1304
01:47:31,029 --> 01:47:32,405
Look what I found.

1305
01:47:32,572 --> 01:47:34,157
Tomorrow, in front
of the White House,

1306
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:35,840
the President will
make his announcement.

1307
01:47:35,992 --> 01:47:38,161
He will be joined by Secretary
of Defense Laird...

1308
01:47:38,328 --> 01:47:39,829
and has even sought the help

1309
01:47:39,913 --> 01:47:41,915
of renowned scientist
Bolivar Trask...

1310
01:47:42,082 --> 01:47:45,585
his special advisor
to combat this mutant issue.

1311
01:47:45,752 --> 01:47:46,872
The White House has asked...

1312
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:48,088
Raven doesn't realize...

1313
01:47:48,171 --> 01:47:50,051
that if she kills Trask
at an event like that...

1314
01:47:50,131 --> 01:47:52,550
with the whole world watching...

1315
01:47:53,301 --> 01:47:55,762
Then I came a
long way for nothing.

1316
01:47:56,304 --> 01:47:58,264
And there's more bad news.
I saw in a report...

1317
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:00,408
they found traces
of her blood in Paris.

1318
01:48:00,725 --> 01:48:03,686
For all we know,
they already have her DNA...

1319
01:48:03,853 --> 01:48:04,979
which is all they'd need.

1320
01:48:05,063 --> 01:48:07,232
To create the
Sentinels of the future.

1321
01:48:10,777 --> 01:48:12,821
There's a theory
in quantum physics...

1322
01:48:12,904 --> 01:48:14,489
that time is immutable.

1323
01:48:14,739 --> 01:48:16,574
It's like a river. You can
throw a pebble into it...

1324
01:48:16,658 --> 01:48:19,953
and create a ripple, but the
current always corrects itself.

1325
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:24,624
No matter what you do, the river just
keeps flowing in the same direction.

1326
01:48:25,041 --> 01:48:26,334
What are you trying to say?

1327
01:48:26,501 --> 01:48:28,419
What I'm saying is...

1328
01:48:28,586 --> 01:48:30,130
what if the war is inevitable?

1329
01:48:30,255 --> 01:48:32,632
What if she's
meant to kill Trask?

1330
01:48:34,175 --> 01:48:36,719
What if this is just
simply who she is?

1331
01:48:38,763 --> 01:48:40,598
Just because someone stumbles,

1332
01:48:40,682 --> 01:48:42,725
loses their way...

1333
01:48:42,892 --> 01:48:44,894
doesn't mean
they're lost forever.

1334
01:48:49,732 --> 01:48:52,443
No, I don't believe
that theory, Hank.

1335
01:48:53,319 --> 01:48:56,322
And I cannot believe
that is who she is.

1336
01:48:57,615 --> 01:48:58,700
Ready the plane.

1337
01:48:58,783 --> 01:49:01,119
We're going to Washington.

1338
01:49:18,303 --> 01:49:19,804
You all right?

1339
01:49:20,054 --> 01:49:21,054
Getting there.

1340
01:49:25,768 --> 01:49:28,438
Whatever happens today, I need
you to promise me something.

1341
01:49:29,314 --> 01:49:32,442
You've looked into my mind
and seen a lot of bad...

1342
01:49:33,318 --> 01:49:34,986
but you've seen the good, too.

1343
01:49:36,029 --> 01:49:37,697
The X-Men.

1344
01:49:38,948 --> 01:49:40,533
Promise me you'll find us.

1345
01:49:42,327 --> 01:49:44,329
Use your power,
bring us together.

1346
01:49:44,954 --> 01:49:47,040
Guide us. Lead us.

1347
01:49:48,708 --> 01:49:51,502
Storm. Scott.

1348
01:49:53,671 --> 01:49:55,006
Jean.

1349
01:49:56,341 --> 01:49:58,509
Remember those names.

1350
01:49:59,510 --> 01:50:01,846
There are so many of us.

1351
01:50:02,513 --> 01:50:04,849
We will need you, Professor.

1352
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:10,230
I'll do my best.

1353
01:50:10,396 --> 01:50:12,065
Your best is enough.

1354
01:50:13,983 --> 01:50:15,693
Trust me.

1355
01:50:39,676 --> 01:50:42,136
There's 12 carriers
inbound, 10 miles!

1356
01:50:43,137 --> 01:50:44,222
They've found us.

1357
01:51:01,281 --> 01:51:03,449
Thousands of people
will be gathered here today.

1358
01:51:03,533 --> 01:51:04,909
They've come from
all over the world...

1359
01:51:05,034 --> 01:51:07,829
to witness history,
along with news crews...

1360
01:51:07,996 --> 01:51:09,539
from at least
50 different countries.

1361
01:51:11,249 --> 01:51:12,583
Thank you.

1362
01:51:14,961 --> 01:51:16,321
Can I see your
invitations, please?

1363
01:51:17,130 --> 01:51:18,381
Yes, you may.

1364
01:51:18,464 --> 01:51:19,632
These two are with me.

1365
01:51:19,716 --> 01:51:20,717
Go ahead.

1366
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:21,926
Thank you.

1367
01:51:28,725 --> 01:51:30,101
Logan!

1368
01:51:30,184 --> 01:51:31,436
Please, this way, sir.

1369
01:51:50,705 --> 01:51:54,584
Fourth infantry...
Took a Bouncing Betty.

1370
01:51:55,835 --> 01:51:57,253
What happened to you?

1371
01:51:58,338 --> 01:51:59,547
Friendly fire.

1372
01:52:00,590 --> 01:52:01,591
The worst kind.

1373
01:52:01,799 --> 01:52:03,092
Yeah.

1374
01:52:17,148 --> 01:52:19,028
I haven't found her yet,
but she has to be here.

1375
01:52:19,150 --> 01:52:20,693
<i>The President
of the United States.</i>

1376
01:52:43,591 --> 01:52:45,301
My fellow Americans...

1377
01:52:45,468 --> 01:52:50,139
today we face the gravest
threat in our history...

1378
01:52:50,264 --> 01:52:51,432
mutants.

1379
01:52:54,602 --> 01:52:57,021
We have prepared
for this threat.

1380
01:53:00,024 --> 01:53:03,611
In the immortal words
of Robert Oppenheimer...

1381
01:53:03,778 --> 01:53:04,904
"Behold."

1382
01:53:05,488 --> 01:53:08,282
"The world will never be
the same again."

1383
01:53:38,813 --> 01:53:39,814
Can I help you?

1384
01:53:43,192 --> 01:53:44,402
No, you can't.

1385
01:54:27,778 --> 01:54:28,988
Here they come.

1386
01:54:35,703 --> 01:54:37,371
<i>This is for you,
brothers and sisters.</i>

1387
01:54:39,957 --> 01:54:41,042
Raven?

1388
01:54:43,794 --> 01:54:44,879
I have her.

1389
01:54:45,546 --> 01:54:46,756
Let me go, Charles.

1390
01:54:48,925 --> 01:54:50,384
There. You see?

1391
01:54:50,551 --> 01:54:51,636
Secret Serviceman.

1392
01:54:51,802 --> 01:54:52,887
Left of the stage.

1393
01:54:53,012 --> 01:54:54,138
Got him. Go.

1394
01:55:14,909 --> 01:55:16,202
What the hell are you doing?

1395
01:55:16,285 --> 01:55:17,703
I didn't tell you
to activate them.

1396
01:55:17,787 --> 01:55:18,955
I didn't.

1397
01:55:37,556 --> 01:55:39,433
<i>Raven, please, listen to me.</i>

1398
01:55:39,934 --> 01:55:44,063
<i>We've been given a second
chance to define who we are.</i>

1399
01:55:46,107 --> 01:55:47,483
<i>Don't do this.</i>

1400
01:55:50,903 --> 01:55:53,155
Gentlemen, you cannot
pass this point.

1401
01:56:00,997 --> 01:56:02,748
We can't stop that many.

1402
01:56:02,915 --> 01:56:05,793
No, but we can slow them down.

1403
01:56:43,664 --> 01:56:45,333
Erik!

1404
01:57:19,617 --> 01:57:20,618
Ah!

1405
01:57:30,169 --> 01:57:31,879
Storm!

1406
01:57:50,272 --> 01:57:51,690
Go, go, go!

1407
01:57:53,651 --> 01:57:54,735
Watch your head!

1408
01:58:07,706 --> 01:58:08,791
Go, go, go!

1409
01:58:08,874 --> 01:58:10,251
Take us to DEFCON 3.

1410
01:58:10,418 --> 01:58:11,658
Mr. President, we are Code Red.

1411
01:58:11,710 --> 01:58:13,087
What's our air
defense readiness?

1412
01:58:13,254 --> 01:58:14,505
All our air
defenses are ready one.

1413
01:58:14,588 --> 01:58:16,006
What the hell
happened out there?

1414
01:58:16,090 --> 01:58:17,174
I will fix it.

1415
01:58:17,258 --> 01:58:18,300
You said that before.

1416
01:58:18,426 --> 01:58:19,635
I wanted to make a statement.

1417
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:22,555
Now the whole goddamn world
knows we can't protect them.

1418
01:58:22,638 --> 01:58:23,722
I will fix it.

1419
01:58:23,806 --> 01:58:25,599
You damn well better.

1420
01:59:37,046 --> 01:59:38,047
Charles!

1421
01:59:39,173 --> 01:59:40,508
No, no, no...

1422
02:00:27,096 --> 02:00:28,847
Is everybody okay?

1423
02:01:02,715 --> 02:01:04,300
No!

1424
02:01:07,428 --> 02:01:08,470
Behind you.

1425
02:01:10,848 --> 02:01:12,725
Ah!

1426
02:01:51,263 --> 02:01:52,264
Now!

1427
02:02:30,302 --> 02:02:31,929
Do what you were made for.

1428
02:02:41,105 --> 02:02:42,606
Where are you?

1429
02:02:48,404 --> 02:02:49,405
Ah!

1430
02:02:59,957 --> 02:03:01,458
I got this! Go!

1431
02:03:44,251 --> 02:03:45,878
Oh, dear God, no.

1432
02:04:01,810 --> 02:04:04,021
So much for being a survivor.

1433
02:04:46,438 --> 02:04:47,731
One of them is in here.

1434
02:04:50,359 --> 02:04:52,110
No, no, no! Don't kill it!

1435
02:04:52,778 --> 02:04:53,862
I need it alive.

1436
02:05:07,292 --> 02:05:08,919
What the hell has happened?

1437
02:06:16,695 --> 02:06:18,905
You built these
weapons to destroy us.

1438
02:06:19,865 --> 02:06:21,575
Why?

1439
02:06:25,162 --> 02:06:27,873
<i>Because you are
afraid of our gifts.</i>

1440
02:06:28,832 --> 02:06:31,335
<i>Because we are different.</i>

1441
02:06:32,502 --> 02:06:35,839
<i>Humanity has always feared
that which is different.</i>

1442
02:06:36,506 --> 02:06:37,883
<i>Well, I am here to tell you...</i>

1443
02:06:38,091 --> 02:06:39,509
to tell the world...

1444
02:06:40,510 --> 02:06:42,679
you are right to fear us.

1445
02:06:43,055 --> 02:06:44,765
<i>We are the future.</i>

1446
02:06:45,515 --> 02:06:48,185
<i>We are the ones
who will inherit this earth.</i>

1447
02:06:48,435 --> 02:06:51,021
And anyone who
stands in our way...

1448
02:06:51,188 --> 02:06:53,190
will suffer the same fate
as these men...

1449
02:06:53,357 --> 02:06:54,691
you see before you.

1450
02:07:01,907 --> 02:07:04,534
<i>Today was meant to be a
display of your power.</i>

1451
02:07:05,285 --> 02:07:07,371
Instead I give you a glimpse...

1452
02:07:07,537 --> 02:07:11,041
<i>of the devastation my race
can unleash upon yours.</i>

1453
02:07:20,258 --> 02:07:22,427
<i>Let this be a warning
to the world.</i>

1454
02:07:23,136 --> 02:07:25,931
<i>And to my mutant brothers
and sisters out there...</i>

1455
02:07:26,723 --> 02:07:28,141
<i>I say this.</i>

1456
02:07:28,892 --> 02:07:30,560
<i>No more hiding.</i>

1457
02:07:30,727 --> 02:07:32,562
<i>No more suffering.</i>

1458
02:07:33,397 --> 02:07:35,774
You have lived in the shadows...

1459
02:07:35,941 --> 02:07:38,777
<i>in shame and fear for too long.
Come out.</i>

1460
02:07:40,028 --> 02:07:41,363
<i>Join me.</i>

1461
02:07:41,446 --> 02:07:44,950
<i>Fight together in
a brotherhood of our kind.</i>

1462
02:07:45,575 --> 02:07:47,244
A new tomorrow...

1463
02:07:48,453 --> 02:07:50,247
that starts today.

1464
02:07:57,546 --> 02:07:59,381
<i>All those years wasted...</i>

1465
02:07:59,548 --> 02:08:01,550
fighting each other, Charles.

1466
02:08:05,095 --> 02:08:08,723
To have a precious
few of them back...

1467
02:08:23,238 --> 02:08:24,478
Mr. President, sir. Stand down.

1468
02:08:24,531 --> 02:08:26,408
I said, stand down!

1469
02:08:28,243 --> 02:08:29,911
You want to make a statement?

1470
02:08:30,370 --> 02:08:32,122
Kill me. Fine.

1471
02:08:32,289 --> 02:08:34,249
But spare everyone else.

1472
02:08:46,803 --> 02:08:48,805
Very heroic, Mr. President...

1473
02:08:49,306 --> 02:08:50,807
but you had no intention...

1474
02:08:50,932 --> 02:08:53,143
of sparing any of us.

1475
02:08:53,602 --> 02:08:56,938
The future of our
species begins now.

1476
02:09:32,474 --> 02:09:33,642
You used to be a better shot.

1477
02:09:33,725 --> 02:09:34,976
Trust me, I still am.

1478
02:09:48,823 --> 02:09:50,325
Get out of my head, Charles!

1479
02:09:50,492 --> 02:09:51,993
Raven.

1480
02:09:52,160 --> 02:09:54,037
Please, do not make us
the enemy today.

1481
02:09:54,246 --> 02:09:56,081
Look around you. We already are.

1482
02:09:56,581 --> 02:09:58,333
Not all of us.

1483
02:09:58,542 --> 02:10:00,794
All you've done so far...

1484
02:10:01,127 --> 02:10:03,129
is save the lives of these men.

1485
02:10:04,172 --> 02:10:06,716
You can show them a better path.

1486
02:10:10,387 --> 02:10:11,846
Shut her down, Charles.

1487
02:10:14,891 --> 02:10:17,561
I've been trying to control you
ever since the day we met...

1488
02:10:18,144 --> 02:10:20,146
and look where that's got us.

1489
02:10:22,274 --> 02:10:25,110
Everything that happens now...

1490
02:10:25,735 --> 02:10:27,946
is in your hands.

1491
02:10:31,992 --> 02:10:34,744
I have faith in you, Raven.

1492
02:12:11,758 --> 02:12:13,885
He's all yours, Charles.

1493
02:12:41,454 --> 02:12:44,082
If you let them have me,
I'm as good as dead.

1494
02:12:44,249 --> 02:12:45,625
You know that.

1495
02:12:46,292 --> 02:12:47,877
I know.

1496
02:12:49,879 --> 02:12:51,548
Goodbye, old friend.

1497
02:12:54,217 --> 02:12:56,052
Goodbye, Erik.

1498
02:13:29,461 --> 02:13:31,463
Are you sure you
should let them go?

1499
02:13:32,422 --> 02:13:33,798
Yes.

1500
02:13:34,424 --> 02:13:36,134
I have hope for them.

1501
02:13:37,302 --> 02:13:41,306
There's going to be a time,
Hank, when we are all together.

1502
02:13:45,185 --> 02:13:47,145
What about Logan?

1503
02:14:18,968 --> 02:14:21,638
<i>The first time.</i>

1504
02:14:24,641 --> 02:14:29,896
<i>Ever I saw your face.</i>

1505
02:14:34,859 --> 02:14:38,196
<i>I thought the sun...</i>

1506
02:15:02,762 --> 02:15:06,015
Buckminster Fuller is a great
example of an architect...

1507
02:15:06,099 --> 02:15:10,353
whose ideas were very similar
to those of a utopian future.

1508
02:15:16,693 --> 02:15:19,362
Good morning, Logan. Late start.

1509
02:15:29,455 --> 02:15:30,790
Have a good lunch.

1510
02:15:30,957 --> 02:15:32,208
Good job. Thank you.

1511
02:15:32,542 --> 02:15:33,876
Very good job.

1512
02:15:34,752 --> 02:15:36,337
Storm.

1513
02:16:07,410 --> 02:16:08,494
Jean.

1514
02:16:09,912 --> 02:16:11,247
Hey, Logan.

1515
02:16:11,789 --> 02:16:12,915
Jean.

1516
02:16:13,625 --> 02:16:15,335
Are you okay?

1517
02:16:17,086 --> 02:16:18,504
You're here.

1518
02:16:19,130 --> 02:16:21,174
Where else would I be?

1519
02:16:23,468 --> 02:16:24,469
Whoa.

1520
02:16:25,303 --> 02:16:27,263
Easy, pal.

1521
02:16:28,806 --> 02:16:31,351
Well, some things never change.

1522
02:16:32,769 --> 02:16:34,354
It's good to see you, Scott.

1523
02:16:36,147 --> 02:16:37,398
Uh-huh.

1524
02:16:37,482 --> 02:16:38,650
See you later, Jean.

1525
02:16:42,779 --> 02:16:44,322
Professor.

1526
02:16:44,781 --> 02:16:47,575
Logan, is everything all right?

1527
02:16:50,953 --> 02:16:52,413
Yeah.

1528
02:16:53,456 --> 02:16:55,291
Yeah, I think it is.

1529
02:17:11,849 --> 02:17:13,059
You did it.

1530
02:17:13,142 --> 02:17:14,394
Did what?

1531
02:17:14,477 --> 02:17:16,479
Logan, don't you have
a class to teach?

1532
02:17:17,146 --> 02:17:18,815
A class to teach?

1533
02:17:19,857 --> 02:17:20,942
History.

1534
02:17:21,651 --> 02:17:23,152
History?

1535
02:17:23,986 --> 02:17:25,655
Actually, I could use
some help with that.

1536
02:17:26,155 --> 02:17:27,657
Help with what?

1537
02:17:27,824 --> 02:17:31,327
Pretty much
everything after 1973.

1538
02:17:35,873 --> 02:17:38,918
I think the history I know
is a little different.

1539
02:17:40,545 --> 02:17:42,255
Welcome back.

1540
02:17:45,007 --> 02:17:46,676
It's good to see you, Charles.

1541
02:17:48,052 --> 02:17:49,887
It's good to see everyone.

1542
02:17:50,054 --> 02:17:51,556
Well...

1543
02:17:52,181 --> 02:17:54,350
I had a promise to keep.

1544
02:17:55,518 --> 02:17:58,771
You and I have a lot of
catching up to do.

1545
02:17:59,689 --> 02:18:01,190
Yeah.

1546
02:18:04,736 --> 02:18:06,863
What's the last thing
you remember?

1547
02:18:11,951 --> 02:18:13,703
Drowning.

1548
02:18:21,961 --> 02:18:23,212
<i>The past.</i>

1549
02:18:24,714 --> 02:18:27,800
<i>A new... and uncertain world.</i>

1550
02:18:39,228 --> 02:18:41,522
<i>A world of
endless possibilities.</i>

1551
02:18:44,275 --> 02:18:46,402
<i>And infinite outcomes.</i>

1552
02:18:48,070 --> 02:18:49,197
You kidding me?

1553
02:18:49,322 --> 02:18:50,782
Oh, he's alive!

1554
02:18:55,161 --> 02:18:57,914
<i>Countless
choices define our fate.</i>

1555
02:18:58,831 --> 02:19:01,292
<i>Each choice, each moment...</i>

1556
02:19:01,459 --> 02:19:04,086
<i>a ripple in the river of time.</i>

1557
02:19:04,253 --> 02:19:06,589
What do you want us to do
with him, Major Stryker?

1558
02:19:06,756 --> 02:19:08,508
<i>Enough ripples...</i>

1559
02:19:08,674 --> 02:19:11,260
<i>and you change the tide.</i>

1560
02:19:11,427 --> 02:19:12,512
I'll take him from here.

1561
02:19:12,678 --> 02:19:16,599
<i>For the future
is never truly set.</i>

1562
02:19:16,623 --> 02:19:36,623
