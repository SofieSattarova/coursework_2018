1
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:11,317
<i>Who am I? You sure you wanna know?</i>

2
00:03:11,484 --> 00:03:14,737
<i>The story of my life is not
for the faint of heart.</i>

3
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:17,573
<i>If somebody said it was
a happy little tale...</i>

4
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,203
<i>...if somebody told you I was just
your average guy, not a care in the world...</i>

5
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,288
<i>...somebody lied.</i>

6
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,626
<i>But let me assure you, this,
like any story worth telling...</i>

7
00:03:28,793 --> 00:03:30,169
<i>...is all about a girl.</i>

8
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:35,549
<i>That girl. The girl next door.
Mary Jane Watson.</i>

9
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,719
<i>The woman I've loved since
before I even liked girls.</i>

10
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,639
<i>I'd like to tell you that's me next to her.</i>

11
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:44,100
<i>Aw, heck, I'd even take him.</i>

12
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,728
Hey! Stop the bus!

13
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,939
<i>That's me.</i>

14
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:51,982
Tell him to stop! Please!

15
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,401
Stop!

16
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,820
Hey! Stop the bus!

17
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:59,073
Stop the bus! He's been chasing us
since Woodhaven Boulevard.

18
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,491
Catch a cab, Parker!

19
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:07,748
Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.

20
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,422
What a geek!

21
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:19,343
- Don't even think about it.
- You're so lame, Parker.

22
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,262
Would you date him?

23
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:41,198
Midtown High seniors.

24
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:45,161
No wandering.
Proceed direct... Knock it off.

25
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:48,789
Remember, it is a privilege to be here.

26
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,501
We're guests of Columbia
University's Science Department.

27
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,879
So behave accordingly.

28
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,132
Let's not have a repeat
of our trip to the planetarium.

29
00:04:58,299 --> 00:04:59,925
Come on, people, stay together.

30
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:02,970
Proceed up the steps
and into the building.

31
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,224
- Where were you?
- Checking out the library.

32
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,977
- Looking at the books.
- Yeah, right.

33
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:14,064
Charles, can we drive
around the corner, please?

34
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,566
Why?

35
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,526
The entrance is right there.

36
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:21,405
Dad, these are public-school kids.
I'm not showing up in the Rolls.

37
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:23,908
What, you want me to trade in
my car for a Jetta...

38
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:27,077
...because you flunked out of every
private school I sent you to?

39
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,247
- It wasn't for me.
- Of course it was.

40
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:32,583
Don't ever be ashamed of who you are.

41
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,294
I'm not ashamed of who I am.

42
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:36,712
It's just...

43
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,422
Just what, Harry?

44
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,382
Forget it.

45
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,428
Pete!

46
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,514
- Hi, Harry.
- Hey, man. What's up?

47
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,057
Harry.

48
00:05:48,224 --> 00:05:50,434
- Won't you be needing this?
- Thanks, Dad.

49
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,771
Peter, may I introduce
my father, Norman Osborn.

50
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:55,356
I've heard so much about you.

51
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:59,109
- Great honor to meet you, sir.
- Harry says you're a science whiz.

52
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,112
You know, I'm something
of a scientist myself.

53
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,449
I read all your research on nanotechnology.
Really brilliant.

54
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:08,702
- And you understood it?
- Yes, I wrote a paper on it.

55
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,164
Impressive.
Your parents must be very proud.

56
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,124
I live with my aunt and uncle.
They are.

57
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,877
Hey, you two! Let's move!

58
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:20,714
- Nice to meet you. Yeah.
- Hope to see you again.

59
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,428
- He doesn't seem so bad.
- Not if you're a genius.

60
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,681
I think he wants to adopt you.

61
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:33,602
There are over 32,000 known
species of spider in the world.

62
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:37,439
They're in the order <i>Araneae</i>,
divided into three suborders.

63
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:38,857
That's amazing!

64
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:43,112
This is the most advanced electron
microscope on the Eastern Seaboard.

65
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,322
It's unreal.

66
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:48,284
Arachnids from all three groups possess...

67
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,704
...varying strengths to help
them search for food.

68
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:56,417
For example, the Delena spider,
family <i>Sparassidae</i>...

69
00:06:56,584 --> 00:07:00,754
...has the ability to jump to catch its prey.

70
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,631
For the school paper?

71
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:12,224
Next, we have the net web spider,
family <i>Filistatidae</i>...

72
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,310
...genus <i>Kukulcania</i>.

73
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:18,897
Spins a funnel-shaped web whose
strands have a tensile strength...

74
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:24,278
...proportionately equal
to the high-tension wires used in bridges.

75
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,488
- Leave him alone.
- Or what?

76
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:29,575
Or his father will fire your father.

77
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:32,369
What's Daddy gonna do? Sue me?

78
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:35,080
What is going on?

79
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:38,334
The next person who talks will fail
this course. I kid you not.

80
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,502
- This grass spider...
- Let's go.

81
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:44,882
...hunts using reflexes with
nerve-conduction velocity so fast...

82
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:48,510
...that some researchers believe
it almost borders on precognition.

83
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,888
- An early awareness of danger.
- They're jerks.

84
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:52,806
A spider-sense.

85
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:55,142
Hey, look at that spider.

86
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:59,772
Some spiders change colors
to blend into their environment.

87
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,899
It's a defense mechanism.

88
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:05,361
Peter, what makes you think
I would want to know that?

89
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,779
Who wouldn't?

90
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:10,699
Over five painstaking years,
Columbia's genetic research facility...

91
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:15,329
- You gonna talk to her now?
- Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.

92
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,414
Armed with these DNA blueprints...

93
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:20,292
...we have now begun what
was once thought impossible.

94
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:24,171
- Disgusting.
- Yeah, hateful little things.

95
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:25,714
I love them!

96
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,925
Yeah, me too.

97
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:32,763
You know, spiders can
change their color...

98
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,767
- ...to blend into their environment.
- Really?

99
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:41,146
- Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.
- Cool.

100
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:44,650
...transfer RNA to encode
an entirely new genome...

101
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:47,945
...combining the genetic information
from all three spiders...

102
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:52,825
...into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.

103
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,451
There's 14.

104
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,286
I beg your pardon?

105
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,997
- One's missing.
- Yeah.

106
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,503
I guess the researchers
are working on that one.

107
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,382
Do you know that this is
the largest electron microscope...

108
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:09,800
...on the Eastern Seaboard?

109
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:14,012
You were talking throughout that
woman's entire presentation.

110
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,848
Let's go talk about how we listen.

111
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:24,148
Now, I don't know what it's like
at those fancy private schools...

112
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,191
...but at Midtown High...

113
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,949
Hey.

114
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:38,412
Could I take your picture?
I need one with a student in it.

115
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,164
- Sure. Yeah.
- Great.

116
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,541
Where do you want me? Over here?

117
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,084
Yeah, that's great.

118
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,170
Don't make me look ugly.

119
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,547
That's impossible.

120
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:56,847
Perfect.

121
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,106
- Is that good?
- Great.

122
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,363
That's great.

123
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,704
M.J., let's go!

124
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,708
Wait. Thanks!

125
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:41,058
Parker, let's do it.

126
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:01,245
We solved the horizon glide
and the multi-G balance issues.

127
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,914
I've already seen the glider.

128
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:06,458
That's not what I'm here for.

129
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,294
General Slocum, good to see you again.

130
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,297
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.

131
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,383
- Norman.
- Mr. Osborn.

132
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,136
Always a pleasure to have
our board of directors visit.

133
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:21,723
I want to see the progress report
on human performance enhancers.

134
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,395
We tried vapor inhalation with rats.
Their strength increased by 800 percent.

135
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:28,313
- Excellent.
- Any side effects?

136
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,690
In one trial, yes.

137
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:32,526
An aberration. All the tests
since have been successful.

138
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:36,446
In the trial that went wrong,
what were the side effects?

139
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,866
Violence, aggression...

140
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:40,868
...and insanity.

141
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,829
- What do you recommend?
- That was only one test.

142
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:47,875
Except for Dr. Stromm, our entire
staff certifies the product...

143
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,878
- ...ready for human testing.
- Dr. Stromm?

144
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,883
We need to take the whole
line back to formula.

145
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,636
- Back to formula?
- Dr. Osborn.

146
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,639
I'll be frank with you.

147
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:05,183
I never supported your program.

148
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,728
We have my predecessor to thank for that.

149
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,647
The general has approved Quest Aerospace...

150
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:13,734
...to build a prototype
of their exoskeleton design.

151
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:17,654
- They test in two weeks.
- And if your performance enhancers...

152
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:22,159
...have not had a successful
human trial by that date...

153
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:24,161
...I'm gonna pull your funding.

154
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:26,663
I'm going to give it to them.

155
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:30,626
Gentlemen. Ladies.

156
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:40,886
And the Lord said, "Let there be light."
And voilà! There is light.

157
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:43,180
Forty soft, glowing watts of it.

158
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:48,185
Good boy. God will be thrilled.
Just don't fall on your ass.

159
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,938
I'm already on my ass, May.

160
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:55,609
When the plant's senior electrician
is laid off after 35 years...

161
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,528
...what else would you call it?
I am on my ass.

162
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,073
Hand me that dish. The green one.

163
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:04,034
The corporation is downsizing the people...

164
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,411
...and upsizing their profits.

165
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:09,539
Ben, you'll get another job somewhere.

166
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:13,460
Well... Well, let's look
in the paper and see.

167
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:17,381
There are the want ads.
What do we got here?

168
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,216
Computer...

169
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:23,136
Computer salesman, computer
engineer, computer analyst.

170
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:27,057
My Lord, even the computers
need analysts these days.

171
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:29,726
May, I'm 68. I'm too old for computers.

172
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:32,688
And besides, I have
a family to provide for.

173
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,774
I love you. And Peter loves you.

174
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:39,277
You're the most responsible
man I've ever known.

175
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,656
We've been down-and-out before.
But somehow, we survive.

176
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:43,865
Yeah.

177
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:49,371
Hi, sweetie. You're just...
Just in time for dinner.

178
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:52,082
Hey. How you doing, buddy?
How was the field trip?

179
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:55,085
I don't feel well.
I'm gonna go to sleep.

180
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:57,796
- You won't have a bite?
- No, thanks. Had a bite.

181
00:13:57,963 --> 00:14:00,298
Did you get some pictures, Peter?

182
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,011
I gotta crash. Everything's fine.

183
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,139
What's that all about?

184
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,495
<i>In this recombination lab...</i>

185
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:35,333
<i>...we use synthesized transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...</i>

186
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,587
<i>...combining the genetic information
from all three spiders...</i>

187
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:43,592
<i>...into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.</i>

188
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:02,027
Dr. Osborn, please.
The performance enhancers aren't ready.

189
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:05,405
The data just doesn't justify this test.

190
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:09,326
Now, I'm asking you for the last time.
We can't do this.

191
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:11,703
Don't be a coward.

192
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,790
Risks are part of laboratory science.

193
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:18,710
Let me reschedule, with a proper
medical staff and a volunteer.

194
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:22,339
- Just give me two weeks.
- Two weeks? In two weeks...

195
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:26,009
...we'll have lost the contract
to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.

196
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:28,929
Sometimes you gotta do things yourself.

197
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:31,765
- Get me the Promachloraperazine.
- For what?

198
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:35,727
It begins catalyzation when
the vapor hits the bloodstream.

199
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,273
Forty thousand years of evolution...

200
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,152
...and we've barely even tapped
the vastness of human potential.

201
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,334
Oh, that's cold.

202
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,060
Norman?

203
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:04,858
Norman!

204
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,485
Norman!

205
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,204
Oh, my God.

206
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:21,499
Oh, my God! Norman?

207
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,419
Oh, my God! Norman!

208
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:28,173
Norman?

209
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:41,937
Back to formula?

210
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,431
Weird.

211
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:30,860
- Peter?
- Yeah?

212
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,988
Are you all right?

213
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:36,324
I'm fine.

214
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:38,743
Any better this morning?
Any change?

215
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,287
Change?

216
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,206
Yep. Big change.

217
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:47,377
- Well, hurry up. You're gonna be late.
- Right.

218
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,147
Okay.

219
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:15,613
- Goodness me!
- Jeez. I thought you were sick.

220
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,532
- I got better.
- You see?

221
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:21,077
- Bye, guys.
- Have you got your lunch money?

222
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:24,914
Hey, Michelangelo, don't forget,
we're painting the kitchen after school.

223
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,876
Sure thing, Uncle Ben.
Don't start without me.

224
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:30,170
And don't start up with me.

225
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:35,383
Teenagers. Raging hormones.
They never change.

226
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:40,096
You're trash!
You're always gonna be trash!

227
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:43,600
- I have to go to school.
- Who's stopping you?

228
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,911
Hi, M.J.

229
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,330
Hey, M.J.

230
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:10,043
I don't know if you realize this,
but we've been neighbors since I was 6.

231
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,630
And I was wondering if we
could get together sometime.

232
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:15,340
I got the car. Hop in.

233
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:18,134
Do something fun?
Or, I don't know.

234
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:21,012
I thought it'd be time
to get to know each other.

235
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,640
Or not.

236
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,773
- Sorry, Parker, the bus is full!
- Hey!

237
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,066
Hey!

238
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:36,027
- Stop the bus! Hey! Hey.
- Catch a cab!

239
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:37,987
Tell him to stop.

240
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,657
- Check him out!
- Dork!

241
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,389
Dad!

242
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:06,724
Dad, are you all right?

243
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:08,852
Harry.

244
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,190
What are you doing on the floor?

245
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:15,692
I don't know.

246
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:18,695
Have you been there all night?

247
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:22,073
Last night I was...

248
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:25,785
What?

249
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,705
- I don't remember.
- Mr. Osborn?

250
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:31,249
Sir, I asked her to wait in the foyer.

251
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:35,712
- My father's not feeling well.
- Mr. Osborn, Dr. Stromm is dead.

252
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:36,963
What?

253
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,675
They found his body in the lab.
He's been murdered, sir.

254
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:44,179
- What are you talking about?
- And the flight suit and the glider...

255
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,389
- What about it?
- It's been stolen, sir.

256
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:14,334
Great reflexes!

257
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:17,337
- Thanks.
- No problem.

258
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:22,133
Hey, you have blue eyes.
I didn't notice without your glasses.

259
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:24,719
You just get contacts?

260
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,436
Well, see you.

261
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:18,815
- What happened?
- He's freaking weird.

262
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:20,650
Did you see that?

263
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,903
Parker?

264
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,104
- It's a fight!
- Think you're pretty funny, freak?

265
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:01,316
- Flash, it was an accident.
- So is my breaking your teeth.

266
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:04,235
- Come on, Flash, stop.
- I don't wanna fight you, Flash.

267
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:06,779
- I wouldn't wanna fight me neither.
- Kick his ass.

268
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:28,009
Help him, Harry.

269
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:34,682
How'd he do that?

270
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,893
Which one?

271
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,686
He's all yours, man.

272
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:55,662
- Yeah!
- Flash, get up!

273
00:24:57,205 --> 00:25:00,291
Jesus, Parker, you are a freak.

274
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,711
Peter, that was... That was amazing.

275
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,756
I'm out of here. Come on.

276
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,427
Peter!

277
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:52,987
Go, web!

278
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:56,199
Fly.

279
00:26:57,784 --> 00:26:59,869
Up, up and away, web!

280
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:02,872
Shazam!

281
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:04,707
Go! Go!

282
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:06,709
Go, web, go!

283
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,577
Tallyho.

284
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:28,082
- Is she back with the beer yet?
- What?

285
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:29,584
Bring me some beer.

286
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,295
- Get up off your ass!
- I paid for beer...

287
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,921
- Stop yelling.
- Stop it!

288
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:36,465
You're as stupid as your mother.
Get away from me!

289
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,217
You are drunk, do you know that?

290
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,928
Where's she going?
Where you going?

291
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:45,391
These dishes are not done.
Somebody's gotta do the dishes.

292
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:48,895
- Why don't you do them?
- Get in here and do the dishes.

293
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:53,232
- You do them. They're yours, anyway.
- I'm going out!

294
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,902
- Were you listening to that?
- No.

295
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:59,488
Well, I heard, but I was just
taking out the trash.

296
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:02,408
I guess you can always hear us.

297
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:06,329
- Everybody shouts.
- Your aunt and uncle don't.

298
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:10,166
Oh, they can scream
pretty good sometimes.

299
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:15,922
Listen, M.J., about today
at school with Flash...

300
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,715
You really freaked us out.

301
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:20,176
I'm sorry. Is he okay?

302
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:24,221
He's just happy you didn't give
him a black eye for graduation.

303
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,645
So where are you going
after you graduate?

304
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,818
I wanna move into the city.

305
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:43,532
And hopefully get a job
as a photographer.

306
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:46,369
Work my way through college.

307
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:48,871
What about you?

308
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:51,040
Headed for the city too.

309
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:54,001
Can't wait to get out of here.

310
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:56,671
I wanna...

311
00:29:57,922 --> 00:29:59,423
What?

312
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,428
No, come on. Try me.

313
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:07,056
I wanna...

314
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:09,392
...act...

315
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:12,061
...on-stage.

316
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:14,397
Really?

317
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:16,941
Oh, that's perfect.

318
00:30:17,108 --> 00:30:19,735
You were awesome in all the school plays.

319
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:21,946
- Really?
- Yeah.

320
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:25,533
I cried like a baby when
you played Cinderella.

321
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,285
Peter, that was first grade.

322
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:30,204
Well...

323
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:32,331
...even so.

324
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,251
Sometimes...

325
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:37,753
...you know people.

326
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:42,383
You can just see what's coming.

327
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:48,180
What do you see coming for you?

328
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:52,601
I don't know.

329
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:59,400
Whatever it is, it's something
I never felt before.

330
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,990
And what for me?

331
00:31:06,157 --> 00:31:07,616
For you?

332
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:11,620
You're gonna light up Broadway.

333
00:31:13,164 --> 00:31:14,623
You know...

334
00:31:18,878 --> 00:31:20,796
...you're taller than you look.

335
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:23,549
I hunch.

336
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:27,094
Don't.

337
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:34,185
Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride
in my new birthday present.

338
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:36,562
Come on.

339
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:38,981
I gotta go.

340
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:40,983
Bye.

341
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:44,320
- Oh, my God, it's gorgeous!
- Yeah, right?

342
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:46,489
- Look at it!
- Hop in.

343
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,949
Oh, my God! What a cool car!

344
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:50,743
Pretty tight, huh?

345
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,414
Wait till you hear the sound system.
Hey, don't scratch the leather.

346
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:58,501
Cool car.

347
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:30,176
Peter?

348
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,304
What's going on in there?

349
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,098
I'm exercising.
I'm not dressed, Aunt May.

350
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:40,019
Well, you're acting so strangely, Peter.

351
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:42,313
Okay. Thanks.

352
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:16,472
Something's bothering him.
Maybe he's too embarrassed to tell me.

353
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,266
Maybe I'm too embarrassed to ask him.

354
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,144
I just don't know anymore.

355
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,897
I'm going to the downtown library.
See you later.

356
00:34:25,064 --> 00:34:28,484
- Wait, Pete. I'll drive you there, buddy.
- I'll take the train.

357
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:32,112
No, I need the exercise.
Go on. Go, go, go.

358
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:46,627
- Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.
- Wait a minute, we need to talk.

359
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:51,173
- We can talk later.
- Well, we can talk now. If you let me.

360
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:54,260
What do we have to talk about?
Why now?

361
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,303
Because we haven't talked for so long...

362
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,472
...May and I don't know
who you are anymore.

363
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:03,686
You shirk your chores. You have all
those weird experiments in your room.

364
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:08,023
- You start fights at school...
- I didn't start that fight, I told you that.

365
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:11,193
- You sure as hell finished it.
- Was I supposed to run away?

366
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,363
No, you're not supposed
to run away, but...

367
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:19,118
Pete, you're changing. I went through
exactly the same thing at your age.

368
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:20,828
No. Not exactly.

369
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:22,079
Peter...

370
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:25,374
...these are the years
when a man changes...

371
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:29,545
...into the man he's gonna
become the rest of his life.

372
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:31,964
Just be careful who you change into.

373
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:38,804
This guy, Flash Thompson,
he probably deserved what happened.

374
00:35:39,388 --> 00:35:42,099
But just because you can beat him up...

375
00:35:42,433 --> 00:35:44,768
...doesn't give you the right to.

376
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:50,733
Remember, with great power
comes great responsibility.

377
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:56,322
Are you afraid I'll become a criminal?
Quit worrying about me, okay?

378
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:59,908
Something's different.
I'll figure it out. Stop lecturing me.

379
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:04,413
I don't mean to lecture or preach.
And I know I'm not your father...

380
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,249
Then stop pretending to be!

381
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:12,755
Right.

382
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:17,843
I'll pick you up here at 10.

383
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:52,419
<i>Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!</i>

384
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:03,514
- One, two, three. That's it!
- Who's the man?

385
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,476
Yeah!

386
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:09,895
Ladies and gentlemen...

387
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:14,566
...give it up for Bone Saw McGraw.

388
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:21,407
For $3000...

389
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:25,119
...is there no one here man
enough to stay in the ring...

390
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:29,998
...for three minutes with this
titan of testosterone?

391
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,795
Who?

392
00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:36,839
I know who.

393
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:41,802
The Flying Dutchman!

394
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:43,595
Next.

395
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:47,724
There's no featherweight
division here, small fry. Next.

396
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:49,726
No, no. Sign me up.

397
00:37:50,144 --> 00:37:53,605
Okay. You understand the NYWL
is not responsible...

398
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:57,860
...for any injury you may and
probably will sustain in said event?

399
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,279
And you're participating
under your own free will?

400
00:38:00,446 --> 00:38:01,530
Yes.

401
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:05,492
Down the hall to the ramp.
May God be with you. Next.

402
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:10,372
Told you! Told you!

403
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:12,374
Winner!

404
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:13,750
Next victim!

405
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:18,505
Are you ready for more?

406
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:23,218
Bone Saw is ready!

407
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:30,309
Will the next victim please
enter the arena at this time?

408
00:38:30,476 --> 00:38:35,272
If he can withstand just three minutes
in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw...

409
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:39,818
...the sum of $3000 will be paid to...

410
00:38:40,611 --> 00:38:43,739
- What's your name, kid?
- The Human Spider.

411
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:46,700
That's it? That's the best you got?

412
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:48,994
- Yeah.
- Oh, that sucks.

413
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:53,665
The sum of $3000 will be paid to...

414
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:57,085
...the terrifying, the deadly...

415
00:38:57,252 --> 00:39:00,506
...the amazing Spider-Man!

416
00:39:02,925 --> 00:39:05,552
- It's "The Human Spider."
- I don't care, get out there.

417
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:08,680
- No, he got my name wrong.
- Get out there, you moron.

418
00:39:11,225 --> 00:39:13,769
Bone Saw will eat you up
and spit you out.

419
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:16,063
I hope you brought your mommy.

420
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:19,775
- We'll break you!
- You'll need someone to cry to.

421
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:26,156
I'm gonna rip all eight of your
feeble legs off one by one.

422
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,742
Oh, my God!

423
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:30,577
Oh, my legs!

424
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:33,372
Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.

425
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:35,541
<i>Kill! Kill! Kill!</i>

426
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:46,635
Cage!

427
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:57,396
Hello? Guys?

428
00:39:58,522 --> 00:40:03,527
Will the guards please lock
the cage doors at this time?

429
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:08,532
This is some kind of mistake.
I didn't sign up for a cage match!

430
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:12,202
Hey! Unlock the thing!
Take the chain off!

431
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:14,246
Hey, freak show!

432
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:16,999
You're going nowhere.

433
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,543
I got you for three minutes.

434
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,045
Three minutes of playtime.

435
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:31,388
- What are you doing up there?
- Staying away from you.

436
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:34,891
That's a cute outfit.
Did your husband give it to you?

437
00:40:42,024 --> 00:40:43,734
Finish him off!

438
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,367
Smash him!

439
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:55,996
<i>Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!</i>

440
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:01,168
- Hit him!
- Harder!

441
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:05,547
Kick his spider ass!

442
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:08,634
Hit him!

443
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:23,982
One, two, three!

444
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,943
That's it! That's it! Winner!

445
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:32,199
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up
for the new champion, Spider-Man!

446
00:41:33,075 --> 00:41:36,745
<i>Spider-Man! Spider-Man! Spider-Man!</i>

447
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:51,426
Now get out of here.

448
00:41:52,803 --> 00:41:55,764
A hundred bucks? The ad said 3000.

449
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:58,308
Well, check it again, webhead.

450
00:41:58,475 --> 00:42:02,396
It said 3 grand for three minutes.
You pinned him in two.

451
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:05,941
For that, I give you 100.
And you're lucky to get that.

452
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:07,442
I need that money.

453
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,987
I missed the part where
that's my problem.

454
00:42:19,121 --> 00:42:22,416
- Hey, what the hell...?
- Put the money in the bag.

455
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:25,752
Hurry up!

456
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:34,052
Hey! He stole the gate!

457
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,179
Stop that guy!

458
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:39,057
Stop him! He's got my money!

459
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:40,726
Thanks.

460
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:44,146
What the hell's the matter with you?
You let him go!

461
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,523
Cut him off in the lobby
and call the cops!

462
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:50,736
You could've taken that guy apart.
Now he'll get away with my money.

463
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:53,155
I missed the part where
that's my problem.

464
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:15,552
- Sir, you gotta get back.
- I can't see. What happened?

465
00:43:16,845 --> 00:43:18,263
Old dude, man.

466
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:22,601
Come on, folks. Keep moving, please.
Keep moving. Let's go!

467
00:43:22,768 --> 00:43:25,562
- What happened?
- Someone got hurt.

468
00:43:25,729 --> 00:43:27,689
- How?
- What went down?

469
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:31,151
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Hey, stay back. Stay back.

470
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:33,487
- Hey. Stay back!
- That's my uncle!

471
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:38,408
- What happened?
- Carjacker. He's been shot.

472
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:41,953
We just called the paramedics.
They're on their way. Stay back.

473
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,497
Uncle Ben?

474
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:45,999
Uncle Ben.

475
00:43:49,753 --> 00:43:51,296
Uncle Ben?

476
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:56,134
Peter.

477
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:58,929
I'm here, Uncle Ben.

478
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:05,894
Peter.

479
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:30,794
They got the shooter.
He's headed south on Fifth Avenue.

480
00:44:30,961 --> 00:44:35,674
We got three cars in pursuit.
All right, folks. Come on, move back.

481
00:46:09,726 --> 00:46:11,019
Hey, hey!

482
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:14,708
Get a unit to the rear!

483
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,421
I got the back!

484
00:47:32,225 --> 00:47:33,518
Who's there?

485
00:47:59,836 --> 00:48:02,922
Don't hurt me. Give me a chance.
Just give me a chance!

486
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:07,635
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance? Did you?

487
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:09,304
Answer me!

488
00:48:12,474 --> 00:48:13,975
<i>Stop that guy!</i>

489
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:20,732
<i>Thanks.</i>

490
00:48:31,076 --> 00:48:32,494
See you.

491
00:48:36,206 --> 00:48:37,499
No...

492
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:57,268
<i>Freeze! We've got the place
completely surrounded.</i>

493
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:42,397
Oh, no. My God.

494
00:49:44,357 --> 00:49:48,069
Oh, no. Oh, my God. No!

495
00:49:56,286 --> 00:49:59,372
- Good evening.
- General. Good to see you.

496
00:50:00,165 --> 00:50:03,042
Our exoskeleton's got real
firepower, General Slocum.

497
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:07,630
Well, if it does what you say it can,
I'll sign that contract tomorrow.

498
00:50:07,797 --> 00:50:09,424
<i>...17, 16...</i>

499
00:50:09,591 --> 00:50:12,927
- He's clear, let's go!
- You're confident about this test?

500
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:15,263
Absolutely. Captain Curtis is our top pilot.

501
00:50:16,014 --> 00:50:18,850
Now, what about your
commitment to OSCORP?

502
00:50:19,017 --> 00:50:22,896
Nothing would please me more than
to put Norman Osborn out of business.

503
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:25,106
<i>...four, three...</i>

504
00:50:25,273 --> 00:50:28,318
- Preflight complete. Mark.
- <i>...two, one. Mark.</i>

505
00:50:32,322 --> 00:50:34,949
<i>We are picking up an unidentified
object, closing fast.</i>

506
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:37,994
- What the hell is that?
- <i>Can you see anything?</i>

507
00:50:38,411 --> 00:50:39,787
Oh, my God!

508
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:52,967
- Say "chess."
- Chess!

509
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:54,844
Peter!

510
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:59,474
My darling, I'm so proud of you.
You looked so handsome up there.

511
00:50:59,641 --> 00:51:03,728
Pete? Good news. Dad got the place
in New York, so we're all set this fall.

512
00:51:03,895 --> 00:51:05,438
- That's great.
- You made it.

513
00:51:08,066 --> 00:51:11,319
It's not the first time
I've been proven wrong.

514
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:15,156
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Dad.

515
00:51:15,657 --> 00:51:18,076
Peter, the science award.
That's terrific.

516
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:19,869
Yeah.

517
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:26,209
I know this has been
a difficult time for you...

518
00:51:26,376 --> 00:51:28,962
...but I want you to try to enjoy this day.

519
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:31,381
Commencement:

520
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:35,677
The end of one thing,
the start of something new.

521
00:51:37,387 --> 00:51:41,182
I don't want to be with you anymore.
Here's your ring.

522
00:51:42,058 --> 00:51:44,018
You know what? Whatever.

523
00:51:44,477 --> 00:51:45,937
Your loss.

524
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:50,191
You're like a brother to Harry.
That makes you family.

525
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:53,278
And if you ever need anything,
just give me a call.

526
00:52:08,084 --> 00:52:10,336
Can I fix you something?

527
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:12,005
No, thanks.

528
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,968
I missed him a lot today.

529
00:53:01,554 --> 00:53:03,056
I know.

530
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,642
I miss him too.

531
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:10,730
But he was there.

532
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:19,197
I can't help thinking about
the last thing I said to him.

533
00:53:19,364 --> 00:53:24,327
He tried to tell me something important,
and I threw it in his face.

534
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:28,164
You loved him...

535
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:32,085
...and he loved you.

536
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,631
He never doubted the man you'd grow into.

537
00:53:36,798 --> 00:53:40,134
How you were meant for great things.

538
00:53:40,802 --> 00:53:43,137
You won't disappoint him.

539
00:54:16,671 --> 00:54:20,842
<i>With great power comes
great responsibility.</i>

540
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:24,220
<i>Remember that, Pete.
Remember that.</i>

541
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:35,440
Hurry up!

542
00:54:47,869 --> 00:54:51,664
He's not a man. My brother saw him
building a nest in Lincoln Center.

543
00:54:51,831 --> 00:54:55,001
I think he's human, a man.
Could be a woman.

544
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:01,841
Bobby. Get a load of this!

545
00:55:05,178 --> 00:55:07,054
He throws up his hands, ropes come out...

546
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:09,348
...and he climbs up them like a spider web.

547
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:13,686
I see the web, his signature,
and I know Spider-Man was here.

548
00:55:13,853 --> 00:55:16,481
The guy protects us, you know,
he protects the people.

549
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:19,400
Some kind of freakyloo or something.
Wackadoo.

550
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:22,028
He stinks and I don't like him.

551
00:55:22,195 --> 00:55:23,905
Don't move, lady!

552
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:34,790
Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot.

553
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:37,043
He has those tights
and that tight little...

554
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:40,630
♪ <i>Dresses like a spider ♪
♪ He looks like a bug</i> ♪

555
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:44,425
♪ <i>But we should all just give him ♪
♪ One big hug</i> ♪

556
00:55:44,592 --> 00:55:49,305
♪ <i>Look out ♪
♪ Here comes the Spider-Man</i> ♪

557
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:56,771
"Who is Spider-Man?"
He's a criminal, that's who he is.

558
00:55:56,938 --> 00:56:00,858
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?

559
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:02,985
<i>Mr. Jameson, your wife needs...</i>

560
00:56:03,152 --> 00:56:04,529
There's a Page 6 problem.

561
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:06,614
We have a Page 1 problem. Shut up.

562
00:56:06,781 --> 00:56:08,366
- Well?
- He's news.

563
00:56:08,533 --> 00:56:10,993
- The clients can't wait.
- They're about to.

564
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:15,206
- He pulled six people off a subway.
- From a wreck he probably caused.

565
00:56:15,373 --> 00:56:17,041
Something goes wrong and he's there.

566
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:19,418
Look! He's fleeing the scene.
What's that tell you?

567
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:22,296
He's not fleeing, he's probably
going to save somebody else.

568
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:23,673
He's a hero!

569
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:26,634
Then why does he wear a mask?
What's he got to hide?

570
00:56:26,801 --> 00:56:29,595
She needs to know if you want chintz
or chenille in the dining room.

571
00:56:29,762 --> 00:56:32,473
- Whichever one's cheaper.
- Mr. Jameson, it's like this:

572
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,975
We double-booked Page 6.

573
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:36,477
So Macy's and Conway's both
have three quarters...

574
00:56:36,644 --> 00:56:39,772
- We sold out four printings.
- Sold out?

575
00:56:39,939 --> 00:56:41,148
Every copy.

576
00:56:41,816 --> 00:56:44,318
Tomorrow, Spider-Man, Page 1,
with a decent picture.

577
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:46,153
- Conway to Page 7.
- That's a problem.

578
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,656
Page 8, give him 10 percent off.
Five percent.

579
00:56:48,823 --> 00:56:50,533
- That can't be done.
- Get out of here!

580
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,618
We don't have a decent picture.

581
00:56:52,785 --> 00:56:55,538
Eddie's been on it for weeks,
but we can barely see him.

582
00:56:55,705 --> 00:56:57,832
What is he, shy?

583
00:56:57,999 --> 00:57:02,003
If we can get a picture of Julia Roberts
in a thong, we can get this weirdo.

584
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:05,590
Put an ad on the front page:
"Cash for a picture of Spider-Man."

585
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:09,218
He doesn't wanna be famous?
I'll make him infamous!

586
00:57:20,438 --> 00:57:21,522
Hey!

587
00:57:21,689 --> 00:57:23,274
Buzz off.

588
00:57:23,816 --> 00:57:27,486
- M.J., it's me, Peter. Hey.
- Hi!

589
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:33,284
- What are you doing around here?
- Begging for a job. How about you?

590
00:57:33,868 --> 00:57:37,622
- I'm headed to an audition.
- An audition? So you're acting?

591
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:39,915
Yeah. I work steady.

592
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:42,877
In fact, I just got off a job.

593
00:57:43,044 --> 00:57:44,170
That's great, M.J.

594
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:48,007
- You're doing it. Living your dream.
- Glamour girl!

595
00:57:48,174 --> 00:57:49,800
Your drawer was short $6!

596
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:52,553
Next time that happens,
I'll take it out of your check.

597
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:57,516
Excuse me, Miss Watson?
I'm talking to you! Hey!

598
00:57:57,683 --> 00:57:59,977
Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you.

599
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:04,106
It better not happen no more.
Don't roll your eyes at me.

600
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:13,032
Some dream, huh?

601
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:16,452
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

602
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:19,413
- Don't tell Harry.
- Don't tell Harry?

603
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:23,376
Don't you guys live together?
We're going out. Didn't he tell you?

604
00:58:24,794 --> 00:58:26,462
Oh, yeah. Right.

605
00:58:26,629 --> 00:58:29,757
I think he'd hate the idea
of my waiting tables.

606
00:58:29,924 --> 00:58:34,345
- He'd think it was low or something.
- It's not low. You have a job.

607
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:38,974
You know, Harry doesn't live
on a little place I like to call Earth.

608
00:58:40,518 --> 00:58:42,436
No, I guess not.

609
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:49,151
Thanks, Pete.

610
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:52,321
We should catch up sometime.

611
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:58,828
Let's get some lunch some evening.

612
00:59:00,371 --> 00:59:04,917
I'll come by and have some of your
Moondance coffee some day.

613
00:59:05,084 --> 00:59:07,795
- And I won't tell Harry.
- No, don't tell Harry.

614
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:09,171
I won't.

615
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:13,342
I won't tell Harry.

616
00:59:24,437 --> 00:59:26,939
Timing's perfect. Hey.

617
00:59:27,106 --> 00:59:30,317
Five new contracts. It'll be great.

618
00:59:32,361 --> 00:59:35,239
Storming Norman's making
his weekly inspection.

619
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:38,701
Spent half of it on the phone.

620
00:59:38,868 --> 00:59:43,539
Look, man, I'm glad you're here.
I need your help. I'm really lost here.

621
00:59:44,415 --> 00:59:45,708
Are you all right?

622
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:50,212
You look like you just got
second place in the science fair.

623
00:59:50,379 --> 00:59:52,214
No, I...

624
00:59:52,882 --> 00:59:55,843
I was late for work and
Dr. Connors fired me.

625
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:57,678
You were late again?

626
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:00,890
I don't get it.
Where do you go all the time?

627
01:00:02,308 --> 01:00:03,559
Around.

628
01:00:03,726 --> 01:00:05,436
Peter Parker.

629
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:08,272
- Maybe you'll tell me who she is.
- Who's that?

630
01:00:08,439 --> 01:00:11,442
- This mystery girl Harry's been dating.
- Dad.

631
01:00:11,901 --> 01:00:13,569
- When do I get to meet her?
- Dad.

632
01:00:13,736 --> 01:00:16,822
Well, sorry. Harry hasn't mentioned her.

633
01:00:19,909 --> 01:00:23,204
Hey, Pete, you're probably
looking for a job now, right?

634
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:26,207
Dad, maybe you can help him out.

635
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:30,711
- No, I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.
- It's no problem. I'll make a few calls.

636
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:35,174
No, I couldn't accept it, sir.
I like to earn what I get. I'll find work.

637
01:00:35,341 --> 01:00:36,967
I respect that.

638
01:00:37,718 --> 01:00:39,804
You want to make it on your own steam.

639
01:00:40,513 --> 01:00:41,972
That's great.

640
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:45,100
What other skills do you have, Parker?

641
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:47,186
I was thinking about photography.

642
01:00:50,356 --> 01:00:51,774
Hello.

643
01:00:53,526 --> 01:00:55,820
Let's go! Move it!

644
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:58,697
Watch the street!

645
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:15,798
Cheese!

646
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:25,724
They're crap.

647
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:28,894
Crap, crap. Megacrap.

648
01:01:29,061 --> 01:01:32,273
- I'll give you $200 for all of them.
- That seems a little low.

649
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:34,483
Take them somewhere else, then.

650
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:36,902
<i>Your wife says the tile
for the foyer is out of stock.</i>

651
01:01:37,069 --> 01:01:38,654
Tell her we'll put a rug there.

652
01:01:39,071 --> 01:01:41,031
Sit down. Give me that.

653
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:45,160
Give you 300.
That's the standard freelance fee.

654
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:47,705
- Tear up Page 1. Run that photo.
- Headline?

655
01:01:47,872 --> 01:01:51,250
"Spider-Man, Hero or Menace?
Exclusive <i>Daily Bugle</i> Photos."

656
01:01:51,417 --> 01:01:53,252
Menace? He was protecting that armored...

657
01:01:53,419 --> 01:01:54,503
Tell you what, Atticus.

658
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:57,339
You take the pictures,
I'll make up the headlines. Okay?

659
01:01:57,506 --> 01:01:59,508
- Yes, sir.
- Goody.

660
01:02:00,009 --> 01:02:03,470
Give this to the girl up front.
She'll see you get paid.

661
01:02:03,971 --> 01:02:06,765
- I'd like a job, sir.
- No jobs. Freelance.

662
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:08,601
Best thing for a kid your age.

663
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:13,105
You bring me more shots of that clown,
maybe I'll buy them.

664
01:02:13,272 --> 01:02:16,233
But I never said you have a job. Meat.

665
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,278
I'll send you a nice box of Christmas meat.
Get out of here.

666
01:02:19,445 --> 01:02:20,696
Bring me more photos.

667
01:02:22,281 --> 01:02:23,532
- Hi.
- Hi.

668
01:02:23,699 --> 01:02:27,119
Mr. Jameson told me to give that to you.

669
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:31,332
- Welcome to the <i>Daily Bugle</i>.
- Thank you.

670
01:02:31,874 --> 01:02:33,250
I'm Peter Parker.

671
01:02:35,753 --> 01:02:37,922
I'm a photographer.

672
01:02:38,714 --> 01:02:41,258
Yes. I can see that.

673
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:50,684
As of today...

674
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:55,022
...OSCORP Industries has
surpassed Quest Aerospace...

675
01:02:55,189 --> 01:02:59,652
...as the principal supplier
to the United States military.

676
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:02,655
In short, ladies and gentlemen
of the board...

677
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:06,033
...costs are down, revenues are up...

678
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,078
...and our stock has never been higher.

679
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:13,666
Wonderful news, Norman.
That's why we're selling the company.

680
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:15,793
What?

681
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:21,131
Quest is recapitalizing in the wake
of the bombing. Expanding.

682
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:24,134
They made a tender offer we can't ignore.

683
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:25,427
Why wasn't I told?

684
01:03:25,594 --> 01:03:29,723
They don't want a power struggle
with entrenched management.

685
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:32,267
The deal is off if you come with it.

686
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:35,854
The board expects your
resignation in 30 days.

687
01:03:36,021 --> 01:03:38,023
But you can't do this to me.

688
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:43,445
I started this company.

689
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:46,907
You know how much I sacrificed?!

690
01:03:50,786 --> 01:03:56,250
- Oh, Max. Please.
- Norman, the board is unanimous.

691
01:03:56,792 --> 01:04:00,796
We're announcing the sale
after the World Unity Festival.

692
01:04:00,963 --> 01:04:02,464
I'm sorry.

693
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:05,592
You're out, Norman.

694
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:17,104
Am I?

695
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:24,111
<i>Welcome to OSCORP Industries
Unity Day Festival.</i>

696
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:27,698
<i>Let's hear it for Macy Gray.</i>

697
01:05:04,151 --> 01:05:07,654
M.J., why didn't you wear the black dress?

698
01:05:08,697 --> 01:05:12,367
Just, I wanted to impress my father.
He loves black.

699
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:17,039
Well, maybe he'll be impressed
no matter what. You think I'm pretty.

700
01:05:17,623 --> 01:05:19,792
I think you're beautiful.

701
01:05:32,805 --> 01:05:36,058
M.J., would you do me a favor?
I forgot my drink inside.

702
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:48,403
- Oh, hi, Mr. Fargas.
- Oh, Harry.

703
01:05:49,488 --> 01:05:54,660
- Have you seen my father around?
- Well, I'm not sure if he's coming.

704
01:06:06,672 --> 01:06:09,174
- What is that?
- Must be new this year.

705
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:16,515
- What is that?
- That's our glider!

706
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:29,236
What the hell was that?

707
01:06:57,723 --> 01:06:59,099
Code 3!

708
01:07:15,115 --> 01:07:17,284
- Oh, my God! Harry!
- M.J.!

709
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:26,710
Harry! Help me! Harry!

710
01:07:32,716 --> 01:07:34,426
Out, am I?

711
01:07:39,014 --> 01:07:41,016
- Mary Jane!
- Harry!

712
01:07:44,144 --> 01:07:46,063
Hello, my dear.

713
01:07:47,105 --> 01:07:48,899
It's Spider-Man!

714
01:08:00,452 --> 01:08:02,371
- Come on, move, kid.
- Billy!

715
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:08,252
Somebody help him!

716
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:10,587
No!

717
01:08:11,463 --> 01:08:13,090
Mommy!

718
01:08:15,092 --> 01:08:16,969
- Hold it right there!
- I surrender.

719
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:20,180
- Oh, boy.
- Hold it right there!

720
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:27,104
Impressive.

721
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:54,840
- Mary Jane!
- Help! Someone please help me!

722
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,658
Hold on!

723
01:09:22,951 --> 01:09:24,578
Watch out!

724
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:36,840
We'll meet again, Spider-Man!

725
01:09:38,425 --> 01:09:40,302
Hold on, Mary Jane!

726
01:10:22,344 --> 01:10:25,055
Well, beats taking the subway.

727
01:10:25,222 --> 01:10:28,517
Don't mind us.
She just needs to use the elevator.

728
01:10:28,683 --> 01:10:29,768
Wait.

729
01:10:29,935 --> 01:10:31,186
Who are you?

730
01:10:31,353 --> 01:10:33,980
- You know who I am.
- I do?

731
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:36,733
Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.

732
01:10:48,495 --> 01:10:52,374
Incredible?
What do you mean he's incredible?

733
01:10:53,542 --> 01:10:57,212
No. All right, wait. Stay there.
I'm gonna come over.

734
01:10:57,879 --> 01:10:59,548
No, I'm gonna come...

735
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:03,301
All right. Fine.
Will you call me in the morning?

736
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:06,471
And we'll go and have breakfast, and...

737
01:11:06,638 --> 01:11:08,932
...I wanna buy you something.

738
01:11:09,099 --> 01:11:12,436
Because I want to.
It'll make you feel better.

739
01:11:13,478 --> 01:11:17,107
Okay. And, like, what do
you mean, incredible?

740
01:11:19,985 --> 01:11:22,362
All right. I'm sorry. Sleep tight.

741
01:11:22,529 --> 01:11:24,489
Don't let the bedbugs...

742
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:32,956
She's all right.
She's just a little rattled.

743
01:11:33,123 --> 01:11:34,541
Yeah.

744
01:11:34,708 --> 01:11:38,336
Look, Pete, I should have
told you about us.

745
01:11:39,671 --> 01:11:42,340
But you should know I'm crazy about her.

746
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:45,552
It's just, you know,
you never made a move.

747
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:48,138
You're right.

748
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:50,682
I didn't.

749
01:11:54,394 --> 01:11:56,980
I'm gonna get some rest.

750
01:11:58,231 --> 01:12:00,484
I'm gonna stay up for a while.

751
01:12:01,568 --> 01:12:03,445
What was that thing?

752
01:12:03,904 --> 01:12:05,238
I don't know.

753
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:10,035
Whatever it is, somebody has to stop it.

754
01:12:25,926 --> 01:12:27,636
Somebody there?

755
01:12:27,802 --> 01:12:29,888
<i>Somebody.</i>

756
01:12:31,223 --> 01:12:32,766
Who said that?

757
01:12:33,433 --> 01:12:36,770
<i>Don't play the innocent with me.</i>

758
01:12:39,231 --> 01:12:41,900
<i>You've known all along.</i>

759
01:12:45,904 --> 01:12:47,280
Where are you?

760
01:12:47,447 --> 01:12:51,493
<i>Follow the cold shiver
running down your spine.</i>

761
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:00,210
<i>I'm right here.</i>

762
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,964
I don't understand.

763
01:13:04,965 --> 01:13:08,176
Did you think it was coincidence?

764
01:13:08,343 --> 01:13:11,930
So many good things,
all happening for you.

765
01:13:12,097 --> 01:13:15,767
All for you. Norman.

766
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:19,729
What do you want?

767
01:13:20,272 --> 01:13:22,399
To say what you won't.

768
01:13:22,566 --> 01:13:25,151
To do what you can't.

769
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:29,906
To remove those in your way.

770
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,787
The board members.

771
01:13:37,122 --> 01:13:38,498
You killed them.

772
01:13:38,665 --> 01:13:40,208
We killed them.

773
01:13:40,584 --> 01:13:41,626
We?

774
01:13:41,793 --> 01:13:43,336
Remember?

775
01:13:43,503 --> 01:13:46,131
Your little accident in the laboratory.

776
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:49,801
The performance enhancers.

777
01:13:49,968 --> 01:13:52,387
Bingo. Me!

778
01:13:52,554 --> 01:13:55,015
Your greatest creation.

779
01:13:55,515 --> 01:13:59,311
Bringing you what you've always wanted:

780
01:13:59,477 --> 01:14:02,355
Power beyond your wildest dreams.

781
01:14:02,522 --> 01:14:05,191
And it's only the beginning.

782
01:14:06,526 --> 01:14:10,822
There's only one who can stop us.

783
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:15,035
Or imagine if he joined us.

784
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:23,043
Spider-Man. And the Green Goblin.

785
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:26,546
The Green Goblin. You like that?
Made it up myself.

786
01:14:26,713 --> 01:14:29,758
- These weirdos all gotta have a name.
- Mr. Jameson, Spider...

787
01:14:29,924 --> 01:14:31,551
- Hoffman!
- Yeah?

788
01:14:32,761 --> 01:14:36,473
Copyright the name "Green Goblin."
I want a quarter every time it's said.

789
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,017
How about "Green Meanie"?

790
01:14:39,184 --> 01:14:42,020
Spider-Man wasn't attacking the city.
That's slander.

791
01:14:42,187 --> 01:14:44,606
It is not. I resent that.

792
01:14:44,773 --> 01:14:47,609
Slander is spoken. In print, it's libel.

793
01:14:47,776 --> 01:14:49,694
You don't trust anybody.
That's your problem.

794
01:14:49,861 --> 01:14:51,571
I trust my barber.

795
01:14:52,364 --> 01:14:53,990
What are you, his lawyer? Get out.

796
01:14:54,157 --> 01:14:56,284
Let him sue me, get rich
like a normal person.

797
01:14:56,451 --> 01:14:58,578
That's what made this country...

798
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:09,631
Jameson, you slime.

799
01:15:09,798 --> 01:15:13,093
Who's the photographer who takes
the pictures of Spider-Man?

800
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:15,136
I don't know. His stuff comes by mail.

801
01:15:15,303 --> 01:15:17,180
- You're lying!
- I swear.

802
01:15:17,347 --> 01:15:19,349
He's the one who can bring me to him.

803
01:15:19,516 --> 01:15:22,477
- I don't know who he is.
- You are useless.

804
01:15:22,644 --> 01:15:24,938
Set him down, tough guy.

805
01:15:25,105 --> 01:15:29,150
- Speak of the devil.
- I knew you two were in this together!

806
01:15:29,609 --> 01:15:32,570
Hey, kiddo, let Mom and Dad
talk for a minute, will you?

807
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:35,198
Sleep...

808
01:15:49,504 --> 01:15:53,675
Wake up, little spider. Wake up.

809
01:15:53,842 --> 01:15:58,304
No, you're not dead yet.

810
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:00,640
Just paralyzed...

811
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:02,892
...temporarily.

812
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:06,896
You're an amazing creature, Spider-Man.

813
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:09,733
You and I are not so different.

814
01:16:10,275 --> 01:16:13,820
I'm not like you. You're a murderer.

815
01:16:13,987 --> 01:16:16,865
Well, to each his own.

816
01:16:17,031 --> 01:16:19,951
I chose my path,
you chose the way of the hero.

817
01:16:20,577 --> 01:16:25,290
And they found you amusing
for a while, the people of this city.

818
01:16:25,457 --> 01:16:28,793
But the one thing they love
more than a hero...

819
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:32,547
...is to see a hero fail, fall, die trying.

820
01:16:32,714 --> 01:16:35,258
In spite of everything
you've done for them...

821
01:16:35,425 --> 01:16:37,135
...eventually, they will hate you.

822
01:16:37,302 --> 01:16:38,553
Why bother?

823
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:43,433
- Because it's right.
- Here's the real truth.

824
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:46,895
There are eight million people in this city.

825
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:51,399
And those teeming masses
exist for the sole purpose...

826
01:16:51,566 --> 01:16:55,528
...of lifting the few exceptional
people onto their shoulders.

827
01:16:55,695 --> 01:16:57,489
You, me...

828
01:16:57,655 --> 01:16:59,657
...we're exceptional.

829
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:04,579
I could squash you like a bug right now.

830
01:17:04,746 --> 01:17:08,458
But I'm offering you a choice. Join me.

831
01:17:08,625 --> 01:17:12,212
Imagine what we could
accomplish together.

832
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:15,131
What we could create.

833
01:17:15,715 --> 01:17:17,717
Or we could destroy.

834
01:17:17,884 --> 01:17:21,888
Cause the deaths of countless
innocents in selfish battle...

835
01:17:22,055 --> 01:17:24,474
...again and again and again
until we're both dead.

836
01:17:24,641 --> 01:17:26,935
Is that what you want?

837
01:17:28,770 --> 01:17:31,815
Think about it, hero!

838
01:17:43,785 --> 01:17:49,123
<i>In spite of everything you've done for them,
eventually, they will hate you.</i>

839
01:17:58,258 --> 01:17:59,300
Hey!

840
01:17:59,467 --> 01:18:01,052
- It's me again.
- Hey!

841
01:18:01,219 --> 01:18:02,762
How was your audition?

842
01:18:02,929 --> 01:18:05,932
- How'd you know?
- The hot line. Your mom...

843
01:18:06,099 --> 01:18:08,017
...told my aunt, told me.

844
01:18:08,518 --> 01:18:09,853
So you just came by?

845
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:13,690
I was in the neighborhood.
Needed to see a friendly face.

846
01:18:13,857 --> 01:18:17,527
I took two buses and a cab to get
in the neighborhood, but...

847
01:18:18,695 --> 01:18:20,405
So how'd it go?

848
01:18:22,365 --> 01:18:24,951
They said I needed acting lessons.

849
01:18:25,118 --> 01:18:28,788
A soap opera told me
I needed acting lessons.

850
01:18:28,955 --> 01:18:30,707
Let me buy you a cheeseburger.

851
01:18:30,874 --> 01:18:34,335
The sky's the limit, up to $7.84.

852
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:38,089
I'd like a cheeseburger.

853
01:18:38,256 --> 01:18:41,551
Oh, but I'm going out
to dinner with Harry.

854
01:18:42,135 --> 01:18:43,553
Come with us.

855
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:46,431
No, thanks. How's it going with...?

856
01:18:48,391 --> 01:18:50,810
Never mind.
That's none of my business.

857
01:18:51,394 --> 01:18:52,896
It's not?

858
01:18:54,272 --> 01:18:55,940
Why so interested?

859
01:18:56,608 --> 01:18:58,234
I'm not.

860
01:18:58,401 --> 01:18:59,819
You're not?

861
01:19:01,404 --> 01:19:04,198
- Well, why would I be?
- I don't know.

862
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:06,367
Why would you be?

863
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:10,455
I... That's a...

864
01:19:10,622 --> 01:19:12,081
I don't know.

865
01:19:14,334 --> 01:19:17,086
Sorry you won't come with us.

866
01:19:19,631 --> 01:19:21,591
I better run, tiger.

867
01:19:30,016 --> 01:19:32,310
Hey, check it out, man.

868
01:19:32,477 --> 01:19:34,145
Come on, man.

869
01:19:37,565 --> 01:19:40,735
Hey, where you going, baby?
Come on!

870
01:19:58,795 --> 01:20:00,254
Get off me!

871
01:20:33,371 --> 01:20:34,998
Wait.

872
01:20:39,919 --> 01:20:42,296
You have a knack for getting in trouble.

873
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:46,843
You have a knack for saving my life.
I think I have a superhero stalker.

874
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:48,928
I was in the neighborhood.

875
01:20:50,805 --> 01:20:53,433
You are amazing.

876
01:20:54,267 --> 01:20:57,103
Some people don't think so.

877
01:20:58,187 --> 01:21:01,149
- But you are.
- Nice to have a fan.

878
01:21:01,941 --> 01:21:05,153
Do I get to say thank you this time?

879
01:21:06,029 --> 01:21:07,530
Wait.

880
01:22:16,516 --> 01:22:18,684
Let me in! My baby's in there!

881
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:20,895
- Let me go!
- The roof's collapsing!

882
01:22:21,062 --> 01:22:24,607
- Somebody save my baby!
- The roof's about to collapse!

883
01:22:24,774 --> 01:22:26,109
Look! Up there!

884
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:34,575
Save my baby, please!

885
01:22:58,307 --> 01:22:59,392
No!

886
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:10,987
- It's okay. Your baby's fine.
- Oh, my baby.

887
01:23:12,238 --> 01:23:15,158
God bless you, Spider-Man.
Bless you.

888
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:17,160
There he is! Don't let him get away!

889
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:20,580
Hold it! You're under arrest.
I'm taking you in.

890
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:23,624
Oh, my God, there's
somebody still up there!

891
01:23:25,293 --> 01:23:27,003
I'm going.

892
01:23:28,546 --> 01:23:31,591
- I'll be here when you get back.
- Not coming back, chief.

893
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:33,092
Go! Go!

894
01:23:41,893 --> 01:23:43,895
Where are you?

895
01:23:45,688 --> 01:23:47,356
Where are you?!

896
01:23:52,612 --> 01:23:54,989
I'm gonna get you out of here!

897
01:23:57,575 --> 01:23:59,285
It's okay.

898
01:24:06,125 --> 01:24:08,711
You're pathetically predictable.

899
01:24:08,878 --> 01:24:10,963
Like a moth to the flame.

900
01:24:11,672 --> 01:24:14,258
What about my generous proposal?

901
01:24:15,176 --> 01:24:18,221
Are you in or are you out?

902
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:21,015
It's you who's out, Gobby.
Out of your mind.

903
01:24:21,182 --> 01:24:23,226
Wrong answer.

904
01:24:24,477 --> 01:24:26,187
Oh, great.

905
01:25:04,934 --> 01:25:07,895
No one says no to me!

906
01:25:15,069 --> 01:25:18,406
- M.J., will you stop goofing around?
- Harry, relax.

907
01:25:20,992 --> 01:25:22,201
He's here.

908
01:25:23,035 --> 01:25:25,663
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

909
01:25:26,372 --> 01:25:29,083
Aunt May. I'm sorry I'm late.

910
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:32,295
Work was murder.
I picked up a fruitcake.

911
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:34,213
Thank you.
We're so glad you could come.

912
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:35,965
- You look great.
- Thanks.

913
01:25:36,132 --> 01:25:38,926
Who is this lovely young lady?

914
01:25:39,093 --> 01:25:43,431
M.J., I'd like you to meet my father.
Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.

915
01:25:43,597 --> 01:25:46,267
I've been looking forward to meeting you.

916
01:25:46,434 --> 01:25:50,187
- Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
- Now, where is Peter?

917
01:25:50,354 --> 01:25:52,606
He'd better have remembered
that cranberry sauce.

918
01:25:58,487 --> 01:26:01,866
Oh, that's weird.
I didn't know he was here.

919
01:26:04,869 --> 01:26:06,579
Peter?

920
01:26:11,292 --> 01:26:12,960
Peter?

921
01:26:14,628 --> 01:26:16,464
Is that you?

922
01:26:19,425 --> 01:26:20,468
Pete?

923
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:25,765
How strange. There's nobody here.

924
01:26:32,438 --> 01:26:36,859
- Bit of a slob, isn't he?
- All brilliant men are.

925
01:27:09,517 --> 01:27:12,144
- Hey, everyone.
- Oh, Peter!

926
01:27:12,311 --> 01:27:14,105
Sorry I'm late, it's a jungle out there.

927
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:18,067
I had to beat an old lady with a stick
to get these cranberries.

928
01:27:18,609 --> 01:27:21,445
Thank you.
Now then, everybody sit down...

929
01:27:21,612 --> 01:27:23,155
...and we can say grace.

930
01:27:24,448 --> 01:27:25,491
Parker.

931
01:27:26,575 --> 01:27:28,494
Here we go.

932
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:37,711
- There we are.
- It looks delicious.

933
01:27:38,212 --> 01:27:39,797
Norman.

934
01:27:41,507 --> 01:27:43,884
Will you do the honors?

935
01:27:55,438 --> 01:27:58,816
Why, Peter, you're bleeding.

936
01:28:00,401 --> 01:28:02,403
Oh, yeah...

937
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:06,991
I stepped off a curb and got clipped
by one of those bike messengers.

938
01:28:07,158 --> 01:28:08,659
Well, let me see.

939
01:28:08,826 --> 01:28:10,411
Oh, my goodness.

940
01:28:10,578 --> 01:28:13,080
- Oh, that looks awful.
- No, it's nothing.

941
01:28:13,247 --> 01:28:16,417
I'll get the first aid kit.
Then we'll say grace.

942
01:28:16,584 --> 01:28:21,797
This is the boys' first Thanksgiving here,
and we'll do things properly.

943
01:28:22,756 --> 01:28:25,885
How did you say that happened?

944
01:28:26,343 --> 01:28:28,095
Bike messenger.

945
01:28:28,262 --> 01:28:30,222
Knocked me down.

946
01:28:35,603 --> 01:28:39,231
- If you'll excuse me, I've got to go.
- Why?

947
01:28:40,107 --> 01:28:43,611
Something has come to my attention.

948
01:28:43,777 --> 01:28:45,070
Are you all right?

949
01:28:45,237 --> 01:28:48,657
I'm fine, just fine.
Thank you, Mrs. Parker. Everyone.

950
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:51,869
- Enjoy the fruitcake.
- Dad!

951
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:55,039
Dad! What are you doing?

952
01:28:55,206 --> 01:28:57,750
I planned this so you'd meet M.J.,
now you have to leave?

953
01:28:57,917 --> 01:28:59,585
I've got to go.

954
01:28:59,752 --> 01:29:04,006
- This girl is important to me.
- Harry, please. Look at her.

955
01:29:04,173 --> 01:29:08,177
Think she's sniffing around because
she likes your personality?

956
01:29:08,344 --> 01:29:11,180
- What are you saying?
- Your mother was beautiful too.

957
01:29:11,347 --> 01:29:12,806
They're all beautiful.

958
01:29:12,973 --> 01:29:17,019
Until they're snarling after your trust
fund like a pack of ravening wolves.

959
01:29:17,186 --> 01:29:18,437
You're wrong about her, Dad.

960
01:29:18,979 --> 01:29:22,149
A word to the not-so-wise
about your little girlfriend:

961
01:29:22,316 --> 01:29:25,027
Do what you need to with her,
then broom her fast.

962
01:29:36,747 --> 01:29:39,208
Thanks for sticking up for me, Harry.

963
01:29:39,375 --> 01:29:42,378
- You heard?
- Everyone heard that creep.

964
01:29:42,545 --> 01:29:46,549
That creep is my father.
With luck, I'll be half of what he is.

965
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:49,009
Shut up about stuff you don't understand!

966
01:29:49,176 --> 01:29:50,844
Harry Osborn!

967
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:53,847
I'm sorry, Aunt May.

968
01:29:56,767 --> 01:30:00,271
<i>Spider-Man is all but invincible.</i>

969
01:30:00,437 --> 01:30:03,649
<i>But Parker, we can destroy him.</i>

970
01:30:03,816 --> 01:30:05,150
I can't.

971
01:30:05,317 --> 01:30:08,320
<i>Betrayal must not be countenanced.</i>

972
01:30:08,487 --> 01:30:10,781
<i>Parker must be educated.</i>

973
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:14,285
What do I do?

974
01:30:14,451 --> 01:30:18,539
<i>Instruct him in the matters
of loss and pain.</i>

975
01:30:18,706 --> 01:30:21,792
<i>Make him suffer.
Make him wish he were dead.</i>

976
01:30:21,959 --> 01:30:23,335
Yes?

977
01:30:23,502 --> 01:30:25,379
<i>And then grant his wish.</i>

978
01:30:26,422 --> 01:30:27,631
But how?

979
01:30:27,798 --> 01:30:32,136
<i>The cunning warrior attacks
neither body nor mind.</i>

980
01:30:32,303 --> 01:30:33,512
Tell me how!

981
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:35,848
<i>The heart, Osborn.</i>

982
01:30:36,015 --> 01:30:39,101
<i>First, we attack his heart.</i>

983
01:30:40,978 --> 01:30:44,523
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses...

984
01:30:44,690 --> 01:30:47,735
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

985
01:30:47,901 --> 01:30:50,904
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us...

986
01:30:59,496 --> 01:31:02,082
Deliver us!

987
01:31:02,249 --> 01:31:03,834
Finish it!

988
01:31:04,001 --> 01:31:07,838
- Finish it!
- From evil!

989
01:31:13,552 --> 01:31:15,721
Two milligrams IV.

990
01:31:17,514 --> 01:31:19,016
Get the BP.

991
01:31:19,183 --> 01:31:21,143
Aunt May. Is she gonna be okay?

992
01:31:21,310 --> 01:31:22,811
- What happened?
- She'll be okay.

993
01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:24,396
You have to leave.

994
01:31:24,563 --> 01:31:26,273
- What happened?
- Those eyes!

995
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:30,110
Those horrible yellow eyes!

996
01:31:35,282 --> 01:31:37,618
He knows who I am.

997
01:32:21,787 --> 01:32:23,539
I'm sorry.

998
01:32:27,209 --> 01:32:29,586
- Will she be okay?
- She's gonna be fine.

999
01:32:29,753 --> 01:32:32,214
She's been sleeping all day.

1000
01:32:33,382 --> 01:32:36,135
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

1001
01:32:40,305 --> 01:32:43,225
How are you?
You okay about the other night?

1002
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:47,146
Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt
bad about leaving Aunt May.

1003
01:32:47,312 --> 01:32:50,274
- Have you talked to Harry?
- He called me.

1004
01:32:50,733 --> 01:32:52,901
I haven't called him back.

1005
01:32:54,987 --> 01:32:56,864
The fact is...

1006
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,701
- ...I'm in love with somebody else.
- You are?

1007
01:33:00,868 --> 01:33:02,077
At least I think I am.

1008
01:33:04,747 --> 01:33:07,791
- It's not the right time to talk about it.
- No, no. Go on.

1009
01:33:07,958 --> 01:33:11,253
Would I know his name, this guy?

1010
01:33:11,420 --> 01:33:14,298
You'll think I'm a stupid
little girl with a crush.

1011
01:33:14,465 --> 01:33:15,883
Trust me.

1012
01:33:16,049 --> 01:33:17,342
It's funny.

1013
01:33:19,344 --> 01:33:22,723
He's saved my life twice,
and I've never even seen his face.

1014
01:33:24,224 --> 01:33:26,935
- Him.
- You're laughing at me.

1015
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:30,105
No, I understand.
He is extremely cool.

1016
01:33:30,272 --> 01:33:33,525
Do you think it's true, all the terrible
things they say about him?

1017
01:33:33,692 --> 01:33:37,654
No, no. Not Spider-Man,
not a chance in the world.

1018
01:33:37,821 --> 01:33:39,490
I know him a little bit.

1019
01:33:39,656 --> 01:33:42,576
I'm sort of his unofficial photographer.

1020
01:33:42,743 --> 01:33:45,954
- Has he mentioned me?
- Yeah.

1021
01:33:46,121 --> 01:33:47,790
What'd he say?

1022
01:33:48,248 --> 01:33:49,833
I said...

1023
01:33:50,667 --> 01:33:55,005
He asked me what I thought about you.

1024
01:33:56,173 --> 01:33:58,133
And what did you say?

1025
01:33:58,634 --> 01:34:02,721
I said, "Spider-Man."

1026
01:34:03,055 --> 01:34:07,976
I said, "The great thing about M.J...

1027
01:34:08,143 --> 01:34:09,770
...is...

1028
01:34:10,604 --> 01:34:13,857
...when you look in her eyes...

1029
01:34:16,401 --> 01:34:19,488
...and she's looking back in yours...

1030
01:34:20,614 --> 01:34:23,617
...everything feels...

1031
01:34:24,827 --> 01:34:26,954
...not quite normal.

1032
01:34:27,913 --> 01:34:29,706
Because you feel...

1033
01:34:30,249 --> 01:34:32,000
...stronger...

1034
01:34:33,418 --> 01:34:37,047
...and weaker at the same time.

1035
01:34:38,090 --> 01:34:40,217
You feel excited...

1036
01:34:41,093 --> 01:34:43,136
...and at the same time...

1037
01:34:43,762 --> 01:34:45,472
...terrified.

1038
01:34:47,724 --> 01:34:52,062
The truth is, you don't know
what you feel...

1039
01:34:53,438 --> 01:34:57,067
...except you know what kind of man
you want to be.

1040
01:34:59,778 --> 01:35:01,655
It's as if you've...

1041
01:35:02,281 --> 01:35:05,450
...reached the unreachable...

1042
01:35:07,035 --> 01:35:09,621
...and you weren't ready for it."

1043
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:14,960
You said that?

1044
01:35:15,752 --> 01:35:18,088
Well, something like that.

1045
01:35:48,452 --> 01:35:49,912
Hey.

1046
01:36:02,382 --> 01:36:03,884
Dad?

1047
01:36:09,222 --> 01:36:11,308
Dad, is that you?

1048
01:36:17,898 --> 01:36:19,399
What is it?

1049
01:36:21,652 --> 01:36:26,073
Well, you were right about M.J.
You're right about everything.

1050
01:36:27,658 --> 01:36:30,452
She's in love with Peter.

1051
01:36:30,619 --> 01:36:32,496
- Parker?
- Yeah.

1052
01:36:32,663 --> 01:36:34,581
And how does he feel about her?

1053
01:36:37,167 --> 01:36:39,711
He's loved her since the 4th grade.

1054
01:36:40,671 --> 01:36:45,926
He pretends like he doesn't,
but there's no one Peter cares for more.

1055
01:36:48,845 --> 01:36:50,597
I'm so sorry.

1056
01:36:53,058 --> 01:36:56,353
I haven't always been
there for you, have I?

1057
01:36:58,271 --> 01:37:01,483
You're busy. You're an important man.
I understand.

1058
01:37:01,650 --> 01:37:03,485
That's no excuse.

1059
01:37:04,486 --> 01:37:06,279
I'm proud of you.

1060
01:37:06,822 --> 01:37:11,702
And I've lost sight of that somewhere.
But I'll make it up to you, Harry.

1061
01:37:11,868 --> 01:37:15,163
I'm going to rectify certain inequities.

1062
01:37:29,261 --> 01:37:31,054
<i>Wake up, little spider.</i>

1063
01:37:31,221 --> 01:37:32,723
Wake up.

1064
01:37:34,057 --> 01:37:35,684
Go home, dear.

1065
01:37:35,851 --> 01:37:37,227
You look awful.

1066
01:37:37,394 --> 01:37:39,688
- And you look beautiful.
- Well, thank you.

1067
01:37:39,855 --> 01:37:43,191
- I don't like to leave you here.
- But I'm safe here.

1068
01:37:43,358 --> 01:37:46,069
- Can I do anything for you?
- You do too much.

1069
01:37:46,236 --> 01:37:51,491
College, a job, all this time with me.
You're not Superman, you know.

1070
01:37:52,534 --> 01:37:54,327
A smile. Finally.

1071
01:37:54,494 --> 01:37:57,706
Haven't seen one of those on your
face since Mary Jane was here.

1072
01:37:57,873 --> 01:38:01,251
Hey. You were supposed to be asleep.

1073
01:38:02,085 --> 01:38:06,882
You know, you were about 6 years old
when M.J.'s family moved in next door.

1074
01:38:07,049 --> 01:38:11,053
And when she got out of the car
and you saw her for the first time...

1075
01:38:11,219 --> 01:38:17,559
...you grabbed me and said,
"Aunt May, Aunt May, is that an angel?"

1076
01:38:17,726 --> 01:38:21,271
- Gee, did I say that?
- You sure did.

1077
01:38:23,857 --> 01:38:26,735
Well, Harry's in love with her.

1078
01:38:26,902 --> 01:38:30,697
- She's still his girl.
- Well, isn't that up to her?

1079
01:38:30,864 --> 01:38:35,494
- She doesn't really know who I am.
- Because you won't let her.

1080
01:38:35,660 --> 01:38:38,830
You're so mysterious all the time.

1081
01:38:38,997 --> 01:38:41,833
Tell me, would it be so dangerous...

1082
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,962
...to let Mary Jane know
how much you care?

1083
01:38:46,421 --> 01:38:48,882
Everybody else knows.

1084
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,095
I'll be right back.

1085
01:38:53,845 --> 01:38:55,388
But...

1086
01:39:02,479 --> 01:39:04,481
Come on, pick up.

1087
01:39:04,648 --> 01:39:07,734
- Hey, M.J....
- <i>Hi, it's me. Sing your song at the beep.</i>

1088
01:39:08,985 --> 01:39:10,987
M.J., it's Peter. You there?

1089
01:39:11,154 --> 01:39:13,865
Hello? You there?

1090
01:39:14,533 --> 01:39:19,037
I'm just calling to check up on you.
Will you call me when you get in?

1091
01:39:19,204 --> 01:39:20,747
All right, well...

1092
01:39:20,914 --> 01:39:22,332
Don't...

1093
01:39:22,874 --> 01:39:25,252
Don't go up any dark alleys.

1094
01:39:25,418 --> 01:39:26,920
Hello?

1095

1096

Where is she?

1097
01:40:21,266 --> 01:40:22,934
- What is that?
- That's cool!

01:41:52,023 --> 01:41:57,112
...or suffer the little children.

1106
01:41:59,364 --> 01:42:01,950
- Spider-Man!
- Save us!

1107
01:42:02,367 --> 01:42:04,786
Save us!

1108
01:42:04,953 --> 01:42:07,622
Make your choice, Spider-Man...

1109
01:42:07,789 --> 01:42:11,167
...and see how a hero is rewarded.

1110
01:42:11,334 --> 01:42:13,461
Don't do it, Goblin!

1111
01:42:13,628 --> 01:42:16,548
We are who we choose to be.

1112
01:42:16,715 --> 01:42:19,509
- Now, choose!
- No!

1113
01:42:48,204 --> 01:42:49,789
Everybody stay still!

1114
01:42:59,174 --> 01:43:00,633
Ahoy up there!

1115
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:03,762
We're gonna bring the barge
right under you.

1116
01:43:11,269 --> 01:43:15,357
- He's coming back!
- Listen. I need you to climb down.

1117
01:43:15,523 --> 01:43:17,025
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!

1118
01:43:22,113 --> 01:43:25,033
M.J., you can do it. You have to.

1119
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:26,910
Trust me.

1120
01:43:28,536 --> 01:43:31,915
Hold on tight and go quickly.

1121
01:43:36,586 --> 01:43:38,713
- Hurry!
- I can't. I can't do it.

1122
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:41,341
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1123
01:44:09,035 --> 01:44:11,579
- He's not gonna make it.
- He's gonna make it!

1124
01:44:21,381 --> 01:44:24,384
It's time to die.

1125
01:44:31,683 --> 01:44:34,144
Come on up here, tough guy,
I got something for you!

1126
01:44:34,310 --> 01:44:35,603
We ought to kick your ass!

1127
01:44:35,770 --> 01:44:39,107
Leave Spider-Man alone!
You're gonna pick on a guy saving kids?

1128
01:44:39,774 --> 01:44:41,317
I got something for your ass!

1129
01:44:41,484 --> 01:44:43,319
Mess with Spidey, you mess with New York!

1130
01:44:43,486 --> 01:44:45,905
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us!

1131
01:44:52,078 --> 01:44:53,705
Yeah!

1132
01:44:59,502 --> 01:45:01,337
Spider-Man, watch out!

1133
01:45:33,161 --> 01:45:37,415
Misery, misery, misery.
That's what you've chosen.

1134
01:45:38,333 --> 01:45:40,960
I offered you friendship...

1135
01:45:41,127 --> 01:45:43,004
...and you spat in my face.

1136
01:46:34,097 --> 01:46:37,809
You've spun your last web, Spider-Man.

1137
01:46:37,976 --> 01:46:41,312
Had you not been so selfish,
your little girlfriend's death...

1138
01:46:41,479 --> 01:46:43,189
...would have been quick and painless.

1139
01:46:43,356 --> 01:46:46,734
But now that you've really pissed me off...

1140
01:46:46,901 --> 01:46:48,903
...I'm gonna finish her...

1141
01:46:49,070 --> 01:46:51,864
...nice and slow.

1142
01:46:56,452 --> 01:46:58,496
M.J. and I...

1143
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:02,584
...we're gonna have a hell of a time.

1144
01:47:56,429 --> 01:47:57,972
Peter, stop!

1145
01:47:58,139 --> 01:48:00,600
Stop! It's me.

1146
01:48:09,567 --> 01:48:11,110
Mr. Osborn.

1147
01:48:11,277 --> 01:48:12,820
Peter, thank God for you.

1148
01:48:12,987 --> 01:48:15,365
You killed those people on that balcony.

1149
01:48:15,531 --> 01:48:18,534
The Goblin killed!
I had nothing to do with it!

1150
01:48:18,701 --> 01:48:20,495
Don't let him take me again.

1151
01:48:20,662 --> 01:48:22,664
I beg you. Protect me.

1152
01:48:22,830 --> 01:48:26,417
You tried to kill Aunt May.
You tried to kill Mary Jane.

1153
01:48:26,584 --> 01:48:28,044
But not you.

1154
01:48:28,753 --> 01:48:32,757
I tried to stop it.
But I couldn't stop it.

1155
01:48:32,924 --> 01:48:35,051
I would never hurt you.

1156
01:48:35,218 --> 01:48:37,178
I knew from the beginning...

1157
01:48:37,345 --> 01:48:40,306
...if anything ever happened to me...

1158
01:48:40,473 --> 01:48:42,600
...it was you that I could count on.

1159
01:48:42,767 --> 01:48:46,062
You, Peter Parker, would save me,
and so you have.

1160
01:48:46,688 --> 01:48:48,731
Thank God for you.

1161
01:48:49,524 --> 01:48:50,900
Give me your hand.

1162
01:48:52,110 --> 01:48:55,530
Believe in me as I believed in you.

1163
01:48:56,989 --> 01:48:59,534
I've been like a father to you.

1164
01:49:01,285 --> 01:49:02,954
Be a son to me now.

1165
01:49:04,747 --> 01:49:06,624
I have a father.

1166
01:49:07,375 --> 01:49:09,877
His name was Ben Parker.

1167
01:49:11,671 --> 01:49:13,172
Godspeed, Spider-Man.

1168
01:49:31,983 --> 01:49:33,651
Peter.

1169
01:49:35,945 --> 01:49:37,822
Don't tell Harry.

1170
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:11,230
What have you done?

1171
01:50:11,397 --> 01:50:13,107
What have you done?!

1172
01:50:36,255 --> 01:50:37,757
Hey.

1173
01:50:41,010 --> 01:50:43,179
I'm so sorry, Harry.

1174
01:50:44,096 --> 01:50:47,099
I know what it's like to lose a father.

1175
01:50:49,393 --> 01:50:52,688
I didn't lose him.
He was stolen from me.

1176
01:50:54,273 --> 01:50:56,567
One day Spider-Man will pay.

1177
01:50:58,444 --> 01:51:01,572
I swear on my father's grave,
Spider-Man will pay.

1178
01:51:06,577 --> 01:51:08,371
Thank God for you, Peter.

1179
01:51:08,996 --> 01:51:11,582
You're the only family I have.

1180
01:51:35,940 --> 01:51:38,234
<i>No matter what I do...</i>

1181
01:51:38,401 --> 01:51:41,404
<i>...no matter how hard I try...</i>

1182
01:51:42,113 --> 01:51:45,950
<i>...the ones I love will always
be the ones who pay.</i>

1183
01:51:56,752 --> 01:51:59,171
You must miss him so much.

1184
01:52:00,131 --> 01:52:03,009
It's been so hard without him.

1185
01:52:06,095 --> 01:52:08,890
There's something I've been
wanting to tell you.

1186
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:12,518
When I was up there...

1187
01:52:13,311 --> 01:52:16,105
...and I thought I was gonna die...

1188
01:52:17,648 --> 01:52:20,443
...there was only one person
who I was thinking of.

1189
01:52:22,862 --> 01:52:26,073
And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.

1190
01:52:27,450 --> 01:52:29,493
It was you, Pete.

1191
01:52:30,828 --> 01:52:32,705
I kept thinking:

1192
01:52:33,164 --> 01:52:35,917
"I hope I make it through this...

1193
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:41,756
...so I could see Peter Parker's
face one more time."

1194
01:52:43,132 --> 01:52:44,634
Really?

1195
01:52:45,051 --> 01:52:50,389
There's only one man who's
always been there for me...

1196
01:52:52,058 --> 01:52:54,018
...who makes me feel...

1197
01:52:54,477 --> 01:52:58,189
...like I'm more than I ever
thought I could be.

1198
01:53:00,316 --> 01:53:01,984
That I'm just...

1199
01:53:02,568 --> 01:53:04,153
...me.

1200
01:53:05,112 --> 01:53:07,156
And that's okay.

1201
01:53:09,367 --> 01:53:11,077
The truth is...

1202
01:53:12,787 --> 01:53:14,789
...I love you.

1203
01:53:16,874 --> 01:53:19,210
I love you so much, Peter.

1204
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:44,110
<i>All I wanted was to tell her
how much I loved her.</i>

1205
01:53:44,276 --> 01:53:46,237
I can't.

1206
01:53:48,489 --> 01:53:50,241
You can't what?

1207
01:53:51,158 --> 01:53:52,785
Tell you...

1208
01:53:54,328 --> 01:53:58,666
...everything. I mean,
there's so much to tell.

1209
01:53:59,750 --> 01:54:03,671
Yeah. There's so much to tell.

1210
01:54:04,422 --> 01:54:06,549
I want you to know...

1211
01:54:07,091 --> 01:54:09,802
...that I will always be there for you.

1212
01:54:09,969 --> 01:54:13,597
I will always be there
to take care of you.

1213
01:54:14,807 --> 01:54:16,892
I promise you that.

1214
01:54:20,104 --> 01:54:22,398
I will always be your friend.

1215
01:54:25,359 --> 01:54:27,278
Only a friend...

1216
01:54:27,987 --> 01:54:29,822
...Peter Parker?

1217
01:54:31,824 --> 01:54:34,493
That's all I have to give.

1218
01:55:00,895 --> 01:55:03,689
<i>Whatever life holds in store for me...</i>

1219
01:55:03,856 --> 01:55:06,776
<i>...I will never forget these words:</i>

1220
01:55:06,942 --> 01:55:11,864
<i>"With great power comes
great responsibility."</i>

1221
01:55:12,031 --> 01:55:14,283
<i>This is my gift.</i>

1222
01:55:14,450 --> 01:55:16,410
<i>My curse.</i>

1223
01:55:16,952 --> 01:55:18,913
<i>Who am I?</i>

1224
01:55:19,371 --> 01:55:21,707
<i>I'm Spider-Man.</i>
