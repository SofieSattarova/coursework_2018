1
00:03:28,716 --> 00:03:33,304
<i>Last night, the FAA was forced to ground
all aircraft, leaving thousands stranded...</i>

2
00:03:33,471 --> 00:03:36,307
<i>... when electronic failures
and mysterious power outages...</i>

3
00:03:36,474 --> 00:03:40,311
<i>... crippled the western United States.
But the big story today...</i>

4
00:03:40,478 --> 00:03:43,355
<i>... the much-anticipated wedding
of fantastic couple...</i>

5
00:03:43,522 --> 00:03:48,068
<i>... Reed Richards and Susan Storm
will take place this Saturday.</i>

6
00:03:50,988 --> 00:03:53,741
Unbelievable. Bizarre anomalies...

7
00:03:53,908 --> 00:03:57,244
...are occurring all over the world,
defying every law of physics...

8
00:03:57,411 --> 00:04:00,915
...and all the media care about
is what china pattern we picked.

9
00:04:01,123 --> 00:04:05,920
What did you pick? The blue ones
with them little flowers? I like them.

10
00:04:06,295 --> 00:04:07,755
Excuse me, would you mind?

11
00:04:07,922 --> 00:04:11,008
- It's happening again, isn't it?
- Yeah, sure.

12
00:04:11,175 --> 00:04:14,512
No. We're not postponing
anything, not this time.

13
00:04:14,678 --> 00:04:19,016
This will be the wedding you dreamed of.
I won't let anything get in the way.

14
00:04:20,017 --> 00:04:24,355
Not even the mysterious transformation
of matter at the subatomic level.

15
00:04:25,022 --> 00:04:28,609
That's the most romantic thing
you've ever said to me.

16
00:04:29,193 --> 00:04:31,779
Which is really pathetic,
when you think about it.

17
00:04:31,946 --> 00:04:35,282
Dr. Richards, I'm very sorry,
but we're overbooked.

18
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:38,953
- We do have seats available in coach.
- Okay, here we go.

19
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:40,454
- Smile!
- Awesome!

20
00:04:40,663 --> 00:04:42,164
Look, Mom!

21
00:04:42,331 --> 00:04:45,125
- Let me get one more.
- That should be fine.

22
00:04:49,004 --> 00:04:50,881
That's my seat.

23
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:53,634
Sorry.

24
00:05:06,564 --> 00:05:08,566
Excuse me.

25
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,497
What if we get an endorsement
from an airline? Get us a private jet?

26
00:05:23,664 --> 00:05:26,417
I think we have enough
endorsement deals.

27
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:32,465
That's funny. Seriously, Reed, it could
help subsidize your little inventions.

28
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:34,967
- No, thanks.
- Excuse me.

29
00:05:35,426 --> 00:05:38,095
- Consider it. Talk to you later.
- Where are you going?

30
00:05:38,929 --> 00:05:40,264
I don't fly coach.

31
00:05:57,823 --> 00:05:59,867
I hope it rains.

32
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:02,453
<i>The snowfall came with no warning...</i>

33
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,331
<i>... and covered the pyramids
in 2 inches of snow.</i>

34
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:08,334
<i>In Japan, some suggest
the solidification of the bay...</i>

35
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,878
<i>... was due to underwater
volcanic activity...</i>

36
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:13,714
...though no such activity
has been reported in the area.

37
00:06:13,964 --> 00:06:16,175
<i>Scientists have ruled out
global warming...</i>

38
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:20,513
<i>... as the cause of the climatic events
being reported around the globe.</i>

39
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:23,516
<i>With scientists unable
to explain the events...</i>

40
00:06:23,682 --> 00:06:27,019
<i>... some are wondering
if the hand of God is at work.</i>

41
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:30,689
<i>In other news, Reed Richards
and Susan Storm's wedding...</i>

42
00:06:30,856 --> 00:06:32,566
<i>... has Manhattan all abuzz.</i>

43
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:36,487
<i>The guest list includes
many of New York's power elite.</i>

44
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,490
Hey, honey.

45
00:06:39,657 --> 00:06:43,244
The city's charging us for three
squad cars they say we destroyed...

46
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:47,581
...during that armored-car robbery.
I only remember two cars getting thrown.

47
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:51,418
Reed.

48
00:06:53,295 --> 00:06:55,923
All right. I'm putting it away.

49
00:06:56,507 --> 00:06:57,591
You were saying?

50
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,178
I have a fitting in half an hour.
The musicians after that.

51
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:06,016
I haven't picked out the place settings
or the flowers. There's too much to do.

52
00:07:06,183 --> 00:07:10,229
Don't worry about it. Between
the two of us, we'll get it all done.

53
00:07:10,437 --> 00:07:12,606
And what were you doing
when I walked in?

54
00:07:12,857 --> 00:07:15,568
- Inputting my to-do list.
- Really?

55
00:07:15,943 --> 00:07:18,112
- Scout's honor.
- Hey, guys.

56
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,948
New uniforms showed up.
What do you think?

57
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,537
I think there's no way
we're wearing that.

58
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,623
What do you have against capitalism?

59
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,586
What's this?

60
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:35,754
- Just a little hobby of mine.
- Yeah?

61
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:39,800
Would it make a good toy,
or is it something science-y?

62
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:41,635
A little of both.

63
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:48,058
I'm both impressed
and disgusted at that.

64
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,394
Yeah. Sue says I'm addicted to it.

65
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:52,396
I wonder why she'd say that.

66
00:07:52,938 --> 00:07:54,982
Hey, Johnny.

67
00:07:55,483 --> 00:08:01,071
Keep it quiet, but I've cross-referenced
and analyzed the global disturbances.

68
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:05,576
They're caused by cosmic radiation, not
unlike the kind which gave us our powers.

69
00:08:05,743 --> 00:08:08,621
Wow, that's really boring.

70
00:08:08,787 --> 00:08:12,833
Listen, I have a very important
wedding issue we need to talk about.

71
00:08:13,334 --> 00:08:15,002
Yeah, of course.

72
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:17,296
Your bachelor party.

73
00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:19,965
No. Seriously, Johnny.

74
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:24,178
John. Focus-testing showed Johnny
skewed a little young.

75
00:08:25,054 --> 00:08:29,058
Seriously, Johnny, no bachelor party.
It's just not my kind of thing.

76
00:08:30,434 --> 00:08:34,897
Then do it for Ben. It means a lot
to the big guy. You'll break his heart.

77
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:37,066
He does have some
sort of rocklike heart.

78
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:39,193
I have too much to do
before the wedding.

79
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,613
I think Sue might have
a problem with it.

80
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,366
You know what Sue
would have a problem with?

81
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:48,202
If somebody told her
you were investigating...

82
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:50,663
...global disturbances
and cosmic radiation...

83
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:56,836
...instead of focusing on the wedding,
like you promised.

84
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,848
- A bachelor party could be fun.
- Yes!

85
00:09:09,014 --> 00:09:11,016
But no exotic dancers.

86
00:09:57,521 --> 00:10:00,483
- This is it?
- I don't know anybody here.

87
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:03,527
I would have invited your friends,
but you don't have any.

88
00:10:04,195 --> 00:10:05,529
Hey!

89
00:10:05,863 --> 00:10:07,531
Johnny, we had a deal.

90
00:10:08,657 --> 00:10:11,410
They're not exotic dancers.

91
00:10:11,827 --> 00:10:13,412
They're just hot.

92
00:10:16,665 --> 00:10:20,878
You're Mr. Fantastic, aren't you?
That's so awesome.

93
00:10:24,507 --> 00:10:26,050
Wow, you're really cute.

94
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,470
I'll need a pitcher with
the biggest handle you've got.

95
00:10:29,637 --> 00:10:31,222
No problem.

96
00:10:46,987 --> 00:10:49,573
Good evening,
and welcome to the Baxter...

97
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:55,329
Could I help you?
No, you can't use that elev...

98
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,504
Ms. Storm will be with your shortly.

99
00:11:06,715 --> 00:11:08,008
Hello?

100
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:09,635
Thanks, Roberta.

101
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,931
May I help you?

102
00:11:14,098 --> 00:11:18,144
- We're here to see Dr. Richards.
- He's not here. Can I help you?

103
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,438
Yes. You can take me
to see Dr. Richards.

104
00:11:23,107 --> 00:11:24,358
Okay.

105
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:34,326
Sorry.

106
00:11:35,703 --> 00:11:40,708
When the universe began, it was
no bigger than a marble. Then, bang!

107
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,544
It exploded.
And in a trillionth of a second...

108
00:11:43,752 --> 00:11:46,964
...it expanded exponentially into
what became the universe we know.

109
00:11:47,465 --> 00:11:50,509
Wow, you're really smart.

110
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,970
Thanks, Candy.
That means a lot to me.

111
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,307
I love this song. Wanna dance?

112
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:57,892
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

113
00:11:58,058 --> 00:11:59,977
- Honestly.
- Come on, you'll be great.

114
00:12:00,144 --> 00:12:02,771
I don't want to embarrass you guys.

115
00:12:13,324 --> 00:12:16,160
Just loosen up. Have some fun.

116
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:18,579
That's it.

117
00:12:18,787 --> 00:12:20,581
Yeah.

118
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:24,376
That's it.

119
00:12:33,928 --> 00:12:36,597
- Guy really knows how to loosen up.
- You're not kidding.

120
00:13:01,163 --> 00:13:02,581
There he is.

121
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,208
Yes.

122
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:06,293
Unfortunately.

123
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,676
For him.

124
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:18,764
Shall we?

125
00:13:23,686 --> 00:13:26,730
I think it might be clobbering time.

126
00:13:27,064 --> 00:13:29,150
Sue. What are you?

127
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:34,405
General Hager.

128
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,448
Let's talk somewhere private.

129
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:40,161
Unless you need to do Jell-O shots
off someone's stomach.

130
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:44,748
I was explaining to the girls
about how the big bang led to...

131
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:49,462
This was Johnny's idea.
I just went along.

132
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:53,674
How does Reed know the general?

133
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:57,136
A few years back, the guy was pushing
a new missile-defense system.

134
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,139
Reed testified that the
technology wouldn't work.

135
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,017
I'm here on direct orders from
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

136
00:14:03,184 --> 00:14:07,438
Personally, I don't like sharing
sensitive information with a civilian.

137
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:11,025
Especially one who enjoys
the public spotlight so much.

138
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,028
Always a pleasure
to see you too, general.

139
00:14:15,237 --> 00:14:16,697
What can I do for you?

140
00:14:16,864 --> 00:14:19,867
As you may know, there've
been unusual occurrences.

141
00:14:20,075 --> 00:14:24,205
Officially, we've downplayed their
significance, but we're concerned...

142
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:29,335
...these anomalies might pose a
credible threat to our national security.

143
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:32,880
These were taken by one of our
spy satellites three days ago.

144
00:14:35,883 --> 00:14:39,136
- What is it?
- We hoped Dr. Richards could tell us.

145
00:14:40,054 --> 00:14:43,474
I'm afraid I've never
seen anything like it. Ben?

146
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:49,146
I would say that it was a meteor,
but the trail's all wrong.

147
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,023
It's giving off its own energy.

148
00:14:51,482 --> 00:14:53,025
Take a look at this.

149
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:57,363
These have been appearing in
remote areas throughout the world.

150
00:14:57,571 --> 00:15:00,825
Field personnel estimate its diameter
to be 200 meters.

151
00:15:01,617 --> 00:15:06,664
To find out what this is about, we need
a way to locate and intercept that object.

152
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:10,793
A sensor could be tied into
the Baxter Building's satellite grid.

153
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,504
We can pinpoint the location
of the object.

154
00:15:13,671 --> 00:15:18,175
- Good. You'll build the sensor for us...
- I'm afraid I can't.

155
00:15:19,802 --> 00:15:21,512
What?

156
00:15:22,138 --> 00:15:26,100
I'm getting married this Saturday.
I just don't have the time.

157
00:15:28,185 --> 00:15:31,939
Richards, your country
needs your help.

158
00:15:33,357 --> 00:15:35,442
Call Professor Jeff Wagner.

159
00:15:35,651 --> 00:15:38,571
He's head of the
Physics Department at Brown.

160
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,281
I expected more, Richards.

161
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:43,617
Even from you.

162
00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:00,759
John Storm,
Fantastic Four Incorporated.

163
00:16:01,177 --> 00:16:03,220
- Ever done any modeling?
- Not interested.

164
00:16:03,387 --> 00:16:06,724
- You got an amazing complexion.
- Not interested.

165
00:16:09,185 --> 00:16:12,897
Wow, and you just walked away.

166
00:16:13,063 --> 00:16:15,399
I was definitely still talking.

167
00:16:15,566 --> 00:16:19,320
I can't believe you just turned down
a science project.

168
00:16:20,154 --> 00:16:23,073
They can build a sensor without me.

169
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,826
The most important thing right now
is our wedding.

170
00:16:25,993 --> 00:16:27,953
No postponements. No interruptions.

171
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,663
Thank you.

172
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:33,000
And, look, about what you saw
back at the bar...

173
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:37,171
Don't worry about it. I know you.

174
00:16:37,838 --> 00:16:40,132
I'm glad you had fun.

175
00:16:40,508 --> 00:16:42,343
Thank you.

176
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:44,637
Besides...

177
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:49,141
...it was nothing compared to what
I did at my bachelorette party.

178
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,520
Talk about wild.

179
00:16:53,854 --> 00:16:55,356
Wild?

180
00:17:05,574 --> 00:17:07,368
Come on.

181
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:40,985
Hey, what are you doing up here?

182
00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:44,822
Nothing. Just needed some air.

183
00:17:45,072 --> 00:17:48,534
You're making that thing
for the general, aren't you?

184
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:51,620
I'm guessing Susie
doesn't know anything about it.

185
00:17:51,787 --> 00:17:53,914
Don't worry, my lips are sealed.

186
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:57,126
That is, they would be if I had any.

187
00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:00,087
Look, don't tell Johnny.

188
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:05,009
- Don't tell Johnny what?
- Great.

189
00:18:05,176 --> 00:18:07,428
- Are you building that thing?
- No.

190
00:18:07,636 --> 00:18:10,723
If Sue finds out, you'll get
an invisible kick in the nuts.

191
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,726
- Hey, hey. We're keeping this quiet.
- I know.

192
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:15,436
Don't worry.

193
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:20,232
It's the wedding of the century.
Reed Richards and Susan Storm...

194
00:18:20,441 --> 00:18:22,735
<i>... Mr. Fantastic
and the Invisible Woman...</i>

195
00:18:24,612 --> 00:18:27,781
<i>... will try again to tie the knot today
in a ceremony in New York.</i>

196
00:18:38,709 --> 00:18:42,129
- Look at these parasites.
- I know, it's unbelievable.

197
00:18:42,296 --> 00:18:43,756
Have they no shame?

198
00:18:47,051 --> 00:18:49,553
Hey! Hey, listen! Listen, everybody!

199
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,808
This is a very special day for my sister,
probably the most important of her life.

200
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:57,978
So I just want to say to you guys,
please respect our privacy.

201
00:18:58,187 --> 00:19:00,022
Come on, Johnny.

202
00:19:00,356 --> 00:19:03,776
Just kidding. We're auctioning off
the exclusive wedding photos...

203
00:19:03,984 --> 00:19:08,322
...to the highest bidder, so go online
and place your bids. Thank you.

204
00:19:08,531 --> 00:19:09,824
Johnny, are you planning...?

205
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,618
So, what's it take to date
the Human Torch?

206
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:16,997
- Fireproof lingerie and a lot of aloe.
- Thank you.

207
00:19:31,595 --> 00:19:33,389
- Are you all right?
- How are you?

208
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,853
Invitation, sir?

209
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:40,813
I should be on that list.

210
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,815
- Name?
- Stan Lee.

211
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:44,441
Yeah, nice try, buddy.

212
00:19:44,608 --> 00:19:46,694
- No, really. I'm Stan Lee.
- Nice try.

213
00:19:50,865 --> 00:19:52,741
This isn't how I imagined it.

214
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,161
It never is.

215
00:19:55,369 --> 00:20:00,040
No, Alicia, it just doesn't feel right.

216
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,377
Sweetie...

217
00:20:04,128 --> 00:20:07,798
...I think even superheroes are allowed
to have wedding-day jitters.

218
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:12,720
It's more than that.
Is my life always gonna be a circus?

219
00:20:12,887 --> 00:20:16,056
Do we really want to raise kids
in all this?

220
00:20:16,223 --> 00:20:19,185
Face it, we're not exactly normal.

221
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,521
Ben and I aren't normal...

222
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,774
...but we don't let it
get in the way of us being happy.

223
00:20:27,443 --> 00:20:28,903
Do you love Reed?

224
00:20:30,154 --> 00:20:32,490
More than I've ever loved anyone.

225
00:20:34,158 --> 00:20:36,994
Then you have nothing
to worry about.

226
00:20:39,663 --> 00:20:41,415
Thank you.

227
00:20:50,591 --> 00:20:52,301
Okay.

228
00:20:53,677 --> 00:20:55,095
- Oh, great.
- What?

229
00:20:55,262 --> 00:20:56,430
I've got a zit.

230
00:20:56,639 --> 00:20:59,934
- Can't you put makeup on it?
- No, no, I got it.

231
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,186
Crisis averted.

232
00:21:02,353 --> 00:21:06,273
Now all I have to do is concentrate
on the area for the next eight hours.

233
00:21:11,111 --> 00:21:13,739
Reed, come on. You're gonna miss
your own wedding.

234
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:15,741
Just a minute.

235
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,536
Almost done.

236
00:21:22,122 --> 00:21:25,793
General, I'm putting
the sensor online now.

237
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:36,637
There. If there's a surge in cosmic
radiation anywhere, you'll know.

238
00:21:36,804 --> 00:21:39,974
<i>Let's hope so. We've gotten
reports of two more craters.</i>

239
00:21:40,141 --> 00:21:41,809
<i>Here comes the bride</i>

240
00:21:42,017 --> 00:21:44,478
All right. Just linking it to my PDA.

241
00:21:44,854 --> 00:21:47,857
- Reed.
- And that's it.

242
00:21:48,357 --> 00:21:51,110
Good, that's great.
Now shave and put on your tux.

243
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:53,737
You're getting married
and you look like a bum.

244
00:21:53,904 --> 00:21:55,906
Absolutely.

245
00:21:57,533 --> 00:21:59,076
What?

246
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:03,622
I'm getting married.

247
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,463
Oh, jeez.

248
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,674
I'm getting married.

249
00:22:15,176 --> 00:22:18,137
I heard of getting cold feet...

250
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,977
Okay.

251
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:27,188
Hey, Johnny.

252
00:22:28,898 --> 00:22:32,651
Does that amaze anyone else?
How did she know it was me?

253
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,988
To be honest,
you kind of smell like ash.

254
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:39,033
- You're late.
- Let's not make today about me.

255
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:40,826
It's Reed and Sue's big day.

256
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:43,662
Let's give them the attention
for a change.

257
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:46,040
Don't do that.

258
00:22:46,373 --> 00:22:48,709
- Okay, you're perfect.
- You're perfect.

259
00:22:53,547 --> 00:22:55,966
I'll see you upstairs.

260
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,469
Bye, Johnny.

261
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:04,225
So seems like you and Alicia are
doing well. Annoyingly so, in fact.

262
00:23:04,391 --> 00:23:06,560
Yeah, I'm a lucky guy.

263
00:23:06,727 --> 00:23:08,562
Yeah, you are.

264
00:23:09,271 --> 00:23:11,190
Question for you, though:

265
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:13,067
How do you guys?

266
00:23:16,737 --> 00:23:19,448
- None of your business!
- Okay, I'm just concerned.

267
00:23:20,157 --> 00:23:22,952
I'd hate to find out
she was killed in a rock slide.

268
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,246
I'll show you a rock slide!

269
00:23:44,849 --> 00:23:47,518
What are you?

270
00:23:57,111 --> 00:23:59,029
Thank you.

271
00:24:00,948 --> 00:24:02,783
Johnny?

272
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,411
You shouldn't tease him so much.

273
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:07,204
It was a joke.

274
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:11,333
I don't know, I think it bothers you
to see him really happy and in love.

275
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,627
I think you're jealous.

276
00:24:13,794 --> 00:24:17,590
You think I'm jealous?
Have you seen the women I've dated?

277
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,508
No.

278
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:25,473
You can only fool yourself
but for so long, Torch.

279
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,935
Hey. It's the bride of stretchy man.

280
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:32,938
- Don't start.
- Don't listen to him. You look gorgeous.

281
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:34,773
We'll see you out there, sweetie.

282
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,277
- Come on. We're on.
- Okay. Okay.

283
00:24:41,906 --> 00:24:44,783
You don't look completely
ridiculous in that dress.

284
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:49,663
Is that obnoxious-brother talk
for "You look kind of nice"?

285
00:24:50,414 --> 00:24:52,249
You look beautiful.

286
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:56,337
Thank you.

287
00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:13,604
Dad would be proud.

288
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:17,942
Yeah.

289
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:44,844
Reed, shut your cell phone off.

290
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,221
Actually, this is a...

291
00:26:27,178 --> 00:26:30,556
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today to...

292
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:35,936
Sue and Reed,
congratulations on your wedding!

293
00:26:38,105 --> 00:26:40,065
Where was I? Oh, yeah.

294
00:26:40,274 --> 00:26:44,445
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here today to join this couple...

295
00:26:44,612 --> 00:26:47,364
...Reed Richards and Susan Storm,
together...

296
00:26:51,035 --> 00:26:54,038
...in the bond of holy...

297
00:26:57,124 --> 00:26:58,292
...matrimony.

298
00:26:58,501 --> 00:27:00,753
I can't believe you
brought that to our wedding.

299
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,880
I know, but there's a good reason.

300
00:27:03,047 --> 00:27:05,633
- We have to do this quickly.
- That's romantic.

301
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:09,762
- Should I continue?
- Yes, please.

302
00:27:10,638 --> 00:27:14,600
- There are many kinds of love.
- Could you skip to the end, please?

303
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:16,769
- Reed.
- Excuse me?

304
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,571
- What happened?
- What's going on?

305
00:27:41,085 --> 00:27:43,712
We've lost power!
We're going down! We're going down!

306
00:27:45,214 --> 00:27:46,298
It's too late.

307
00:27:54,223 --> 00:27:56,267
- Pull up!
- I'm trying! I'm trying!

308
00:28:14,118 --> 00:28:15,661
Ben!

309
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:31,010
- Johnny.
- This is Dolce.

310
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,057
Flame on!

311
00:28:52,656 --> 00:28:54,200
Man, he's fast.

312
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:08,172
That is cool.

313
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:22,102
- Hey, taxi!
- Oh, man!

314
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,036
Showoff.

315
00:30:09,525 --> 00:30:11,610
Time to end this.

316
00:30:15,364 --> 00:30:16,740
Can we talk?

317
00:30:27,084 --> 00:30:29,462
Okay, you win.

318
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:40,931
Flame on! Come on!

319
00:30:41,098 --> 00:30:43,184
Flame on!

320
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:07,541
Hey.

321
00:31:19,762 --> 00:31:22,473
Your herald summons you.

322
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,434
Another world awaits.

323
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,270
Let it be done quickly.

324
00:31:33,484 --> 00:31:38,572
It looked like a man, but completely
covered in silver, and it flew this, like...

325
00:31:38,739 --> 00:31:41,408
...surfboard-type thing.
I know that sounds crazy.

326
00:31:41,575 --> 00:31:43,536
Oh, no, not at all.

327
00:31:43,744 --> 00:31:47,665
Did you follow the shiny man to
Lollipop Land or the Rainbow Junction?

328
00:31:47,832 --> 00:31:51,252
- I know what I saw.
- Thank you. It's all right, Johnny.

329
00:31:51,585 --> 00:31:56,090
Whatever this thing is, it has the ability
to convert matter and energy.

330
00:31:56,257 --> 00:31:58,092
So it caused the anomalies?

331
00:31:58,259 --> 00:32:01,178
It seems to radiate cosmic energy
when it exerts itself...

332
00:32:01,345 --> 00:32:05,766
...randomly affecting matter.
Evidently, this entity, this...

333
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:09,770
...Silver Surfer...

334
00:32:10,104 --> 00:32:13,858
...didn't want to be detected.
It destroyed the sensor.

335
00:32:14,024 --> 00:32:17,278
- It knew it was being monitored?
- And traced it back here.

336
00:32:17,486 --> 00:32:20,406
We're dealing with something
highly resourceful.

337
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:24,618
Are you feeling okay?

338
00:32:24,827 --> 00:32:27,705
Yeah. I just... I gotta walk this off.

339
00:32:32,042 --> 00:32:34,128
We must destroy it
before it attacks again.

340
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:37,631
Richards, find me
another way to track it.

341
00:32:44,346 --> 00:32:46,056
Sue, I am so sorry.

342
00:32:46,223 --> 00:32:49,602
I didn't tell you, because I
didn't want you to worry.

343
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:52,646
I'm not mad you built the sensor.
You did the right thing.

344
00:32:52,813 --> 00:32:54,064
Oh, great.

345
00:32:57,485 --> 00:32:59,612
I wasn't finished.

346
00:33:02,698 --> 00:33:04,742
Okay. Sorry. Please continue.

347
00:33:04,909 --> 00:33:07,161
This proves what I've been saying.

348
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:09,163
Could you drop the force field?

349
00:33:09,371 --> 00:33:11,749
We can't even... Sorry.

350
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:14,668
Even our wedding
turns into World War III.

351
00:33:14,877 --> 00:33:18,964
I know. But once we are married,
everything will be back to normal.

352
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:23,052
We will never have normal lives
as long as we do what we do.

353
00:33:23,219 --> 00:33:26,055
How could we possibly
raise a family like this?

354
00:33:29,767 --> 00:33:32,645
I'm gonna go check on Johnny.

355
00:33:45,533 --> 00:33:47,493
Johnny?

356
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:56,585
Hey, are you all right, pal?

357
00:33:58,087 --> 00:33:59,380
Are you all right?

358
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,676
Johnny?

359
00:34:04,301 --> 00:34:06,470
Johnny, are you okay?

360
00:34:06,637 --> 00:34:11,142
I don't know. I've been feeling really
strange since my run-in with surfer boy.

361
00:34:11,308 --> 00:34:13,894
Maybe we should get you checked out.

362
00:34:15,354 --> 00:34:17,648
- Why did you do that?
- I didn't do anything!

363
00:34:17,815 --> 00:34:19,984
Stop, drop and roll!
Stop, drop and roll!

364
00:34:20,151 --> 00:34:23,904
Oh, my God, Sue! Just...

365
00:34:24,113 --> 00:34:26,490
Just hang on! I'll get you, okay?

366
00:34:27,783 --> 00:34:29,076
Flame on!

367
00:34:30,661 --> 00:34:32,580
Hey, watch it.

368
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:38,002
Reed!

369
00:34:38,169 --> 00:34:40,421
Reed! Reed!

370
00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:42,339
- Help!
- Sue?

371
00:34:42,506 --> 00:34:44,049
I'm on fire!

372
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:47,386
- Sue! What's going on?
- I'm on fire!

373
00:34:47,553 --> 00:34:49,555
- You're on fire!
- You think?

374
00:34:49,722 --> 00:34:52,224
- Hold on!
- Pull me in!

375
00:34:54,852 --> 00:34:56,937
Hey, it's the Human Torch!

376
00:34:57,563 --> 00:34:58,564
Johnny!

377
00:34:58,731 --> 00:35:01,108
- I'm not Johnny!
- Sue, how did this happen?

378
00:35:01,275 --> 00:35:04,069
I touched Johnny, and then this.

379
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:06,614
- Where is Johnny?
- Here.

380
00:35:06,822 --> 00:35:08,949
Try it again.

381
00:35:13,454 --> 00:35:15,122
- Nice.
- There you go.

382
00:35:15,331 --> 00:35:17,458
Hey, get out of there.

383
00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:18,793
Sue, your clothes.

384
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:24,089
Why does this always happen to me?

385
00:35:24,799 --> 00:35:26,801
All of Sue's results are normal.

386
00:35:27,009 --> 00:35:28,761
But Johnny's...

387
00:35:28,928 --> 00:35:30,137
Johnny's are what?

388
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:35,810
Your encounter with the Surfer put your
molecules in a constant state of flux.

389
00:35:38,771 --> 00:35:40,231
Is that bad?

390
00:35:41,273 --> 00:35:44,068
It caused you to temporarily
switch powers with Sue.

391
00:35:44,235 --> 00:35:46,821
- I'd like to run more tests and...
- Want a volunteer?

392
00:35:47,029 --> 00:35:48,405
- No, no, hey!
- No, no, no!

393
00:35:48,572 --> 00:35:51,283
No, no, hey! This is serious!

394
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,993
I just wanted to give him a hug.

395
00:35:53,202 --> 00:35:55,412
We don't know the extent
of his condition.

396
00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:57,164
It could be progressive.

397
00:35:57,373 --> 00:35:59,291
- It could be fun.
- No, Ben!

398
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,127
Ben!

399
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:05,005
Hey. Hey, it's me! I'm back!

400
00:36:13,597 --> 00:36:15,933
Oh, my God!

401
00:36:16,934 --> 00:36:19,478
Come on!
We just said this is serious!

402
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:21,147
Oh, yeah, serious.

403
00:36:23,566 --> 00:36:25,276
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

404
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:30,698
- Hey, not bad.
- Incredible.

405
00:36:30,906 --> 00:36:33,492
- You better be able to fix this!
- I'm right on it.

406
00:36:35,161 --> 00:36:37,663
- Ben, stop it!
- I see why you like that.

407
00:36:38,998 --> 00:36:40,708
Oh, no, no, no.

408
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:44,670
Crap.

409
00:36:44,837 --> 00:36:48,007
That's not funny. What am I
supposed to do in the meantime?

410
00:36:48,174 --> 00:36:50,843
Just try to keep
your distance from us.

411
00:36:53,471 --> 00:36:57,683
You and me are gonna be spending
a whole lot of time together, pal!

412
00:37:07,067 --> 00:37:10,321
<i>My inside sources tell me
unlucky bride-to-be Sue Storm...</i>

413
00:37:10,488 --> 00:37:13,240
<i>... turned invisible
and is staying that way...</i>

414
00:37:13,449 --> 00:37:16,243
<i>... after yesterday's
embarrassing fiasco.</i>

415
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:20,164
<i>Next, the Invisible Woman's
greatest fashion blunders...</i>

416
00:37:20,331 --> 00:37:24,043
<i>... and an impromptu dance routine
from former scientist Reed Richards.</i>

417
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,756
Why do you keep watching this?
Just ignore it.

418
00:37:29,048 --> 00:37:32,092
I can't ignore it, Reed.
There's no getting away from it!

419
00:37:32,301 --> 00:37:34,428
- I believe there is.
- How?

420
00:37:36,514 --> 00:37:38,599
See? No answer.

421
00:37:42,353 --> 00:37:44,021
Yes, there is.

422
00:37:44,188 --> 00:37:48,192
What if, after this crisis is over...

423
00:37:48,984 --> 00:37:52,196
...we leave it all behind?
- What are you talking about?

424
00:37:52,363 --> 00:37:54,698
We move out of the Baxter Building.

425
00:37:54,865 --> 00:37:57,368
I'll take a teaching position
somewhere.

426
00:37:57,535 --> 00:37:59,370
Get back to my research.

427
00:37:59,537 --> 00:38:04,208
The two of us will live our lives
and raise a family, like normal people.

428
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:06,293
You would do that?

429
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,296
Nothing is more important to me
than our future together.

430
00:38:11,215 --> 00:38:13,050
Oh, thank you.

431
00:38:19,306 --> 00:38:21,433
What about Ben and Johnny?

432
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,726
They'll understand.

433
00:38:23,853 --> 00:38:27,481
Besides, Johnny's always
been more of a solo act.

434
00:38:27,648 --> 00:38:29,567
Let's not mention it to them yet.

435
00:38:29,733 --> 00:38:34,613
Johnny's got enough to worry about
as it is, with his power problems.

436
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,174
You've been busy, my friend.

437
00:39:35,341 --> 00:39:38,219
Your talents are impressive.

438
00:39:40,638 --> 00:39:43,307
Can you understand what I'm saying?

439
00:39:45,935 --> 00:39:48,729
Together, we could be unstoppable.

440
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:53,025
Anything would be ours for the taking.

441
00:39:53,192 --> 00:39:56,320
All that you know is at an end.

442
00:39:57,196 --> 00:39:59,323
What do you mean by that?

443
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:02,409
Wait! I said, wait!

444
00:40:27,017 --> 00:40:30,604
They're breaking up the team.
Reed and Sue, I overheard them.

445
00:40:30,771 --> 00:40:33,482
They want a nice, normal,
boring-ass life.

446
00:40:33,691 --> 00:40:35,734
- No more Fantastic Four.
- Well...

447
00:40:35,943 --> 00:40:38,279
...what do we do?
Keep going, just the two of us?

448
00:40:38,445 --> 00:40:40,865
And call ourselves what?
The Dynamic Duo?

449
00:40:42,241 --> 00:40:44,118
When were they gonna tell us?

450
00:40:44,285 --> 00:40:46,620
They'll tell you when they're ready.

451
00:40:46,829 --> 00:40:48,622
It's their decision, not yours.

452
00:40:48,831 --> 00:40:51,917
You can't be mad at them
for doing what makes them happy.

453
00:40:53,627 --> 00:40:54,920
Guys.

454
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:57,590
We've got a serious problem.

455
00:40:57,965 --> 00:41:02,303
I cross-referenced the Surfer's radiation
through every astronomical database.

456
00:41:02,511 --> 00:41:05,973
Altair 7, Rigel 3, Vega 6.

457
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:09,143
- He's been to all these planets?
- And now they're lifeless.

458
00:41:09,393 --> 00:41:11,645
Barren. Some even shattered.

459
00:41:11,812 --> 00:41:15,649
Everywhere the Surfer goes,
eight days later, the planet dies.

460
00:41:19,028 --> 00:41:20,905
How are we gonna stop him?

461
00:41:21,071 --> 00:41:23,324
We don't even know where he is.

462
00:41:25,743 --> 00:41:27,161
What about the craters?

463
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,211
They appear in a numerical sequence.

464
00:41:35,419 --> 00:41:38,672
The last crater was formed
in Greenland...

465
00:41:39,048 --> 00:41:41,258
...so the next in the sequence
should be...

466
00:41:41,425 --> 00:41:44,345
...latitude 51 degrees,
30 minutes north...

467
00:41:44,512 --> 00:41:49,975
...longitude zero degrees,
seven minutes west.

468
00:42:01,695 --> 00:42:04,657
When he surfaces, move the fight
away from the crowd.

469
00:42:04,907 --> 00:42:07,952
He's too fast to contain.
When I see silver, I'm hitting him!

470
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:11,163
You can't do that. We stick to the plan
and work as a team.

471
00:42:11,372 --> 00:42:12,957
Oh, we're a team now?
News to me.

472
00:42:13,124 --> 00:42:15,960
- What are you talking about?
- You know what.

473
00:42:16,127 --> 00:42:17,378
We were gonna tell you.

474
00:42:17,586 --> 00:42:21,215
- When? When you moved our stuff out?
- Johnny, this isn't a good time.

475
00:42:21,382 --> 00:42:24,218
Kid's got a point, Reed.
You should have told us.

476
00:42:24,426 --> 00:42:26,720
That's enough!
We'll talk about this later.

477
00:42:26,887 --> 00:42:29,473
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

478
00:42:36,105 --> 00:42:37,815
It's a whirlpool!

479
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,316
Oh, my God.

480
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,241
What is that?

481
00:43:05,092 --> 00:43:06,510
Get out! Get out!

482
00:43:26,697 --> 00:43:28,365
Don't let go!

483
00:43:39,543 --> 00:43:41,462
- Move!
- Come on! Go!

484
00:43:58,479 --> 00:44:00,231
No, Johnny!

485
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,710
Guys? What are you doing?

486
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:31,762
Ben! Lift it higher!

487
00:44:31,971 --> 00:44:33,472
I'll try.

488
00:45:05,254 --> 00:45:06,839
Sue!

489
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:15,806
Stay back,
before you get somebody killed.

490
00:45:18,934 --> 00:45:21,061
Oh, my God.

491
00:45:41,207 --> 00:45:42,583
What the hell was that?

492
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:46,045
We'll make adjustments.
Next time, we'll be ready.

493
00:45:46,212 --> 00:45:48,798
Next time? There's no next time.

494
00:45:49,882 --> 00:45:53,260
You can't handle this alone.
I'm bringing in help.

495
00:45:53,427 --> 00:45:57,431
Bringing in soldiers and weaponry
will put innocent people in danger.

496
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,099
No more than you already have.

497
00:46:04,939 --> 00:46:06,065
Victor?

498
00:46:06,816 --> 00:46:09,944
What's the matter?
Afraid of ghosts?

499
00:46:11,487 --> 00:46:13,739
- Look out!
- Don't move!

500
00:46:13,906 --> 00:46:17,451
Since you're a ghost,
you won't mind if I break your neck.

501
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,537
- Let him go.
- You know who that is?

502
00:46:19,703 --> 00:46:22,123
Victor von Doom.
He's here under my orders.

503
00:46:29,171 --> 00:46:30,214
Ben, let him go.

504
00:46:33,968 --> 00:46:35,261
How is this possible?

505
00:46:38,013 --> 00:46:39,473
How are you still alive?

506
00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:43,269
No thanks to you four,
that's for certain.

507
00:46:43,477 --> 00:46:47,106
Von Doom's made contact with the
alien. He's got valuable information.

508
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:50,609
Information that might just
help save the planet.

509
00:46:51,152 --> 00:46:52,945
Now let's be clear about this...

510
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,990
...shall we? I hate you.

511
00:46:58,659 --> 00:47:00,286
All of you.

512
00:47:01,203 --> 00:47:05,958
But the world's at stake and we
need to work together to survive.

513
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:10,796
General, we know firsthand, you trust
Victor and you're gonna regret it.

514
00:47:10,963 --> 00:47:15,384
So far, the only one I've regretted
trusting here is you, Richards.

515
00:47:17,136 --> 00:47:18,512
Reed, don't agree to this.

516
00:47:24,935 --> 00:47:26,395
Let's see what he's got.

517
00:47:27,062 --> 00:47:30,149
I made a detailed recording
of our little encounter.

518
00:47:30,816 --> 00:47:33,819
<i>All that you know is at an end.</i>

519
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,656
Well?

520
00:47:37,823 --> 00:47:41,327
I like the part where
he knocks you on your ass.

521
00:47:43,996 --> 00:47:47,833
Look at where the energy levels surge
when he attacks me.

522
00:47:49,835 --> 00:47:51,796
There? See what happened?

523
00:47:54,632 --> 00:47:58,886
The energy was channeled through him,
but it originated from his board.

524
00:47:59,053 --> 00:48:03,432
If we can separate him from the board,
we can cut off his power completely.

525
00:48:03,641 --> 00:48:06,227
- That's what we have to do.
- How?

526
00:48:06,435 --> 00:48:09,396
If I knew that,
I wouldn't need you people, would I?

527
00:48:11,649 --> 00:48:14,068
You two should
get started right away.

528
00:48:20,116 --> 00:48:22,743
I'm glad we have the opportunity
to collaborate again.

529
00:48:24,745 --> 00:48:27,581
I'll try to talk slowly
so you can keep up.

530
00:48:34,672 --> 00:48:37,258
How can we be working
on the same side as Victor?

531
00:48:37,424 --> 00:48:41,095
You got me. Things were simpler
when I could just whale on the guy.

532
00:48:41,846 --> 00:48:44,140
What's he doing? A fire.

533
00:48:44,306 --> 00:48:45,766
Look at that.

534
00:48:49,436 --> 00:48:51,105
I'll pay for that.

535
00:48:52,606 --> 00:48:56,277
I'll tell you, Ben, I'm starting
to feel like a complete screw-up.

536
00:48:56,443 --> 00:48:59,238
Hey, hey, you're not
a complete screw-up.

537
00:48:59,405 --> 00:49:00,948
Thank you.

538
00:49:01,157 --> 00:49:05,077
Look, kid, it's out of our hands.
It's up to the eggheads now.

539
00:49:05,578 --> 00:49:09,874
You think Reed's right about
the whole end-of-the-world thing?

540
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,793
He's never been wrong
about this kind of thing before.

541
00:49:13,627 --> 00:49:16,046
You know, I'm not exactly
a deep kind of guy.

542
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:17,798
Really?

543
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,470
But if Reed's right, and this is it...

544
00:49:25,723 --> 00:49:28,392
...how do you want
to spend your last few minutes?

545
00:49:28,809 --> 00:49:31,770
Part of me would like
to go out fighting.

546
00:49:34,148 --> 00:49:35,983
But the truth is...

547
00:49:36,192 --> 00:49:39,320
...l'd like to spend my last
couple of minutes holding Alicia.

548
00:49:41,989 --> 00:49:44,074
That sounds pretty good.

549
00:49:44,241 --> 00:49:47,661
I mean, not the "holding Alicia" thing.
She's your girlfriend, not mine.

550
00:49:47,912 --> 00:49:50,915
Want nothing to do with her.
Not to say she's not attractive.

551
00:49:51,081 --> 00:49:54,502
She's very attractive.
She's so attractive.

552
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:58,923
Even with the... I can't think of
a guy that wouldn't want to...

553
00:50:00,508 --> 00:50:02,176
What I meant...

554
00:50:02,843 --> 00:50:05,012
...was that it's nice
to have somebody.

555
00:50:07,556 --> 00:50:10,351
Well, you got me, pal.

556
00:50:26,075 --> 00:50:27,451
How's it going?

557
00:50:27,618 --> 00:50:29,453
I can't find a link.

558
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:32,164
- It'll be all right.
- No, it won't!

559
00:50:32,331 --> 00:50:36,043
The whole world's
counting on me, and I just...

560
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:38,796
Reed, you're gonna find the answer.

561
00:50:38,963 --> 00:50:40,548
- You always do.
- Thanks, Sue.

562
00:50:40,756 --> 00:50:42,550
- You just need to relax.
- Yeah, right.

563
00:50:42,716 --> 00:50:46,512
You do. Reed, you need to relax.

564
00:50:47,221 --> 00:50:49,348
Take a deep breath.

565
00:50:50,057 --> 00:50:51,892
Slower.

566
00:50:52,059 --> 00:50:54,145
There you go.

567
00:50:55,104 --> 00:50:57,606
Come on. Again.

568
00:50:59,275 --> 00:51:03,863
See? I can already
feel your pulse slowing down.

569
00:51:05,698 --> 00:51:08,701
- Do you remember that time...?
- A pulse.

570
00:51:11,078 --> 00:51:12,329
A tachyon pulse.

571
00:51:13,414 --> 00:51:15,040
I love you.

572
00:51:15,749 --> 00:51:17,209
I'm glad I could help.

573
00:51:38,189 --> 00:51:40,232
<i>So exactly how does this thing work?</i>

574
00:51:40,441 --> 00:51:43,527
When we activate the field,
it'll separate him from his board...

575
00:51:43,694 --> 00:51:46,739
...making him powerless.
- Like a fish in a net.

576
00:51:47,364 --> 00:51:48,908
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

577
00:51:49,241 --> 00:51:51,744
- In theory, anyway.
- How long until it's operational?

578
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:54,955
- Three hours.
- Three hours.

579
00:51:55,164 --> 00:51:58,042
I can only go so fast,
since I'm working by myself.

580
00:51:58,209 --> 00:52:01,921
- What do you need to make this happen?
- There are a couple of things.

581
00:52:02,087 --> 00:52:04,965
Do your field engineers
have a beryllium casing?

582
00:52:15,643 --> 00:52:17,436
What are you doing?

583
00:52:18,562 --> 00:52:21,315
- Don't you knock?
- You're supposed to be helping Reed.

584
00:52:21,649 --> 00:52:22,817
Tell him not to worry.

585
00:52:23,025 --> 00:52:26,612
I'll be there to hold his hand
and finish his little project for him.

586
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,662
- Anything else?
- How'd you do it?

587
00:52:36,622 --> 00:52:37,957
How did you come back?

588
00:52:41,794 --> 00:52:43,504
It scares you, doesn't it?

589
00:52:46,465 --> 00:52:47,967
The things I can do.

590
00:52:48,926 --> 00:52:51,595
Did you know I could create
a force field inside someone's body...

591
00:52:51,762 --> 00:52:53,722
...and expand it until they explode?

592
00:52:54,473 --> 00:52:56,267
Give it your best shot.

593
00:53:00,896 --> 00:53:03,440
Just get back to the lab.

594
00:53:10,531 --> 00:53:12,158
Mr. Storm?

595
00:53:12,324 --> 00:53:15,828
We're heading to intercept the Surfer
in 10 minutes, with or without you.

596
00:53:16,036 --> 00:53:21,709
Were you waiting outside the bathroom
to try and catch me in a towel?

597
00:53:27,798 --> 00:53:30,509
That was a joke. I was joking.

598
00:53:30,676 --> 00:53:33,679
Why are you so down on me?
You don't even know me.

599
00:53:34,013 --> 00:53:37,308
I know you very well.
I read your personality profile.

600
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:40,311
Confident. Reckless. Irresponsible.

601
00:53:40,478 --> 00:53:42,771
Self-obsessed,
bordering on narcissism.

602
00:53:44,398 --> 00:53:45,733
Okay, so you do know me.

603
00:53:45,941 --> 00:53:49,278
All I've seen is a guy
that almost got his team killed.

604
00:53:50,237 --> 00:53:51,822
Okay.

605
00:53:52,406 --> 00:53:55,075
I've been a little off my game lately.

606
00:53:55,576 --> 00:53:57,411
This is not a game.

607
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:13,928
- Sir, he's in position north of here.
- Good.

608
00:54:14,094 --> 00:54:17,014
- General, give us a one-mile perimeter.
- Forget it, Richards.

609
00:54:17,181 --> 00:54:20,434
You had your shot and you blew it.
This is a military operation now.

610
00:54:20,643 --> 00:54:23,896
Jam the signal, get out of the way,
and let us do our job.

611
00:54:24,063 --> 00:54:27,233
- You don't understand.
- No, you don't understand.

612
00:54:27,399 --> 00:54:30,194
So let me make it clear for you
and your pack of freaks.

613
00:54:30,402 --> 00:54:33,322
I'm the quarterback.
You're on my team.

614
00:54:33,906 --> 00:54:35,032
Got it?

615
00:54:36,117 --> 00:54:41,080
But I guess you never played football
in high school, did you, Richards?

616
00:54:41,705 --> 00:54:43,624
No, you're right, I didn't.

617
00:54:44,083 --> 00:54:47,461
I stayed in and studied,
like a good little nerd.

618
00:54:48,963 --> 00:54:51,090
And fifteen years later...

619
00:54:51,257 --> 00:54:54,135
...l'm one of the greatest minds
of the 21 st century.

620
00:54:54,343 --> 00:54:56,554
I'm engaged to the hottest girl
on the planet.

621
00:54:57,346 --> 00:54:59,974
And the jock who played quarterback
in high school...

622
00:55:00,474 --> 00:55:03,102
...is right in front of me,
asking me for my help.

623
00:55:04,103 --> 00:55:07,314
And I say he's not gonna
get a damn thing...

624
00:55:07,481 --> 00:55:10,151
...unless he does exactly
what I tell him to...

625
00:55:10,317 --> 00:55:14,238
...and starts treating my friends
and me with some respect.

626
00:55:23,164 --> 00:55:25,124
Give him what he wants.

627
00:55:27,293 --> 00:55:29,295
I am so hot for you right now.

628
00:55:29,462 --> 00:55:32,089
- Me too.

629
00:55:45,186 --> 00:55:46,645
This is it.

630
00:55:47,062 --> 00:55:51,650
You have your coordinates. Set up
your posts and rendezvous back here.

631
00:56:03,746 --> 00:56:05,039
First squad, move out!

632
00:56:37,404 --> 00:56:42,535
Hey. You scared me there, Smokey.
Look at you. You're cute.

633
00:56:49,708 --> 00:56:51,919
Yeah, that's right.
Keep running, Boo Boo.

634
00:56:54,046 --> 00:56:55,548
Overgrown furball.

635
00:56:57,383 --> 00:56:59,927
<i>- What's our status?
- Yeah. I'm good to go.</i>

636
00:57:00,136 --> 00:57:02,221
- Same here.
- Almost there.

637
00:57:13,858 --> 00:57:14,900
Guys?

638
00:57:15,776 --> 00:57:18,112
<i>- We have a problem.
- What's wrong?</i>

639
00:57:18,279 --> 00:57:19,530
He's here.

640
00:57:21,198 --> 00:57:23,284
<i>Get out of there, right now!</i>

641
00:57:45,764 --> 00:57:47,641
Why are you destroying our planet?

642
00:57:49,518 --> 00:57:51,520
I have no choice.

643
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:53,647
- Sue!
- Wait!

644
00:57:56,817 --> 00:57:59,028
What do you mean,
you don't have a choice?

645
00:57:59,278 --> 00:58:01,655
There's always a choice.

646
00:58:02,656 --> 00:58:04,617
Not always.

647
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:08,454
Why are you trying to destroy us?

648
00:58:08,746 --> 00:58:11,457
I am not the Destroyer.

649
00:58:12,458 --> 00:58:15,169
Come on, Richards.
Jam the damn signal.

650
00:58:15,336 --> 00:58:17,963
Maybe he needs a little persuasion.

651
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:21,675
<i>- Fire one over the top.
- Roger, out.</i>

652
00:58:36,273 --> 00:58:37,358
- Open fire.
- Open fire.

653
00:58:37,608 --> 00:58:39,652
Open fire! Repeat, open fire!

654
00:58:48,369 --> 00:58:50,329
Fall back! Fall back!

655
00:58:53,332 --> 00:58:55,376
- Let me just...
- No, wait!

656
00:58:57,002 --> 00:58:58,796
Reed.

657
00:58:59,463 --> 00:59:00,506
Come on, Sue.

658
00:59:02,258 --> 00:59:04,051
All right, it's up.

659
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,303
Reed.

660
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:07,596
Got him.

661
00:59:32,913 --> 00:59:36,750
Not so tough now, are you?

662
00:59:44,884 --> 00:59:47,261
Victor! Stay back!

663
00:59:47,761 --> 00:59:49,638
You're the quarterback.

664
01:00:07,239 --> 01:00:09,658
Eyes on!
Keep your weapons trained!

665
01:00:10,284 --> 01:00:12,620
- Perimeter secure!
- Move him out.

666
01:00:18,793 --> 01:00:21,170
- Open the gate!
- Get him to the debriefing room.

667
01:00:34,642 --> 01:00:36,268
- We had an agreement.
- Calm down.

668
01:00:36,435 --> 01:00:38,145
The enemy has been captured.

669
01:00:38,312 --> 01:00:40,272
- Where is he?
- Contained.

670
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:42,566
General?

671
01:00:43,818 --> 01:00:45,194
Mr. Sherman.

672
01:00:47,822 --> 01:00:50,157
If you'll excuse us,
we have work to do.

673
01:00:50,366 --> 01:00:53,619
- I want to be there for the questioning.
- Not gonna happen.

674
01:00:53,786 --> 01:00:57,289
Make sure our guests remain here,
comfortably.

675
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:58,707
Yes, sir.

676
01:01:01,127 --> 01:01:03,003
General, what about the board?

677
01:01:03,212 --> 01:01:06,841
It's in a chamber which
continuously scrambles the signal.

678
01:01:24,567 --> 01:01:27,027
There are certain things
I'm not permitted to do...

679
01:01:27,236 --> 01:01:29,864
...because they're considered
human-rights violations.

680
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:33,242
Fortunately, you're not human.

681
01:01:39,623 --> 01:01:41,333
Are we prisoners?

682
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,836
How did that happen?

683
01:01:44,003 --> 01:01:47,006
Apparently, they don't want us
interfering with their methods.

684
01:01:47,214 --> 01:01:49,508
I can't imagine what
they're doing to him.

685
01:01:49,675 --> 01:01:52,678
- I say he gets what he deserves.
- How can you say that?

686
01:01:52,887 --> 01:01:55,723
I'm just saying maybe
the general's right about this.

687
01:01:55,890 --> 01:01:58,976
The guy was about to destroy
the planet. He said so himself.

688
01:01:59,143 --> 01:02:03,814
It doesn't make sense. He protected me
from the missile. Why would he do that?

689
01:02:04,023 --> 01:02:05,816
Maybe he thinks you're cute.

690
01:02:05,983 --> 01:02:08,903
There's more going on.
He said he wasn't the Destroyer.

691
01:02:09,069 --> 01:02:10,696
Maybe he lied?

692
01:02:14,617 --> 01:02:17,578
We need to get inside there
and talk to him.

693
01:02:18,329 --> 01:02:20,331
But under the radar.

694
01:02:24,376 --> 01:02:27,588
Is there any way
we could get some DVDs...

695
01:02:27,797 --> 01:02:29,673
...or popcorn or something?

696
01:02:29,882 --> 01:02:31,509
- I'll call it in.
- Great.

697
01:02:31,675 --> 01:02:33,594
Thank you. Semper fi.

698
01:02:33,761 --> 01:02:36,430
That's the Marine Corps.
We're the Army.

699
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:39,308
Right, I know it's the Army.

<i>Captain Raye. Access granted.</i>

701
01:03:03,749 --> 01:03:05,251
General.

702
01:03:05,417 --> 01:03:08,129
Von Doom wants to speak with you.

703
01:03:08,379 --> 01:03:11,799
You should really be
a little more cooperative.

704
01:03:11,966 --> 01:03:14,635
Mr. Sherman, let's take a break.

705
01:03:32,695 --> 01:03:34,488
I know you are there.

706
01:03:46,917 --> 01:03:48,461
What's your name?

707
01:03:50,713 --> 01:03:52,673
Come on, you must have a name.

708
01:03:53,507 --> 01:03:55,092
I'm Susan.

709
01:03:59,805 --> 01:04:04,810
You said you weren't the one trying
to destroy our world. Then who is?

710
01:04:05,019 --> 01:04:07,480
- The one I serve.
- Who do you serve?

711
01:04:10,649 --> 01:04:15,112
I'm trying to help you, but to do that,
you have to tell me the truth.

712
01:04:15,654 --> 01:04:16,864
Please.

713
01:04:28,375 --> 01:04:31,921
It is known by many names.
My people called it...

714
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,840
...Galactus...

715
01:04:35,049 --> 01:04:36,801
...the Devourer of Worlds.

716
01:04:40,513 --> 01:04:43,849
It must feed on energy to survive.

717
01:04:44,391 --> 01:04:45,518
Both thermal...

718
01:04:46,519 --> 01:04:47,645
...and organic.

719
01:04:47,812 --> 01:04:49,355
How can you serve this thing?

720
01:04:49,522 --> 01:04:51,023
Because I must.

721
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:55,736
Doesn't it bother you, all the worlds and
innocent people you've helped destroy?

722
01:04:56,070 --> 01:05:00,199
My service spares my world...

723
01:05:00,491 --> 01:05:02,535
...and the one I love.

724
01:05:05,079 --> 01:05:07,206
Why did you try to protect me?

725
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:10,209
Because...

726
01:05:11,335 --> 01:05:14,880
...you remind me of her.

727
01:05:28,978 --> 01:05:31,188
Could you stop the Destroyer
if you wanted to?

728
01:05:31,397 --> 01:05:35,234
It is not I who draws the Destroyer here.
It is the beacon.

729
01:05:35,568 --> 01:05:37,111
What's the beacon?

730
01:05:37,278 --> 01:05:39,405
The source of my power.

731
01:05:39,613 --> 01:05:40,614
Your board?

732
01:05:45,286 --> 01:05:48,956
Take joy in the last few hours
you have left...

733
01:05:49,123 --> 01:05:51,375
...for he is nearly here.

734
01:06:08,309 --> 01:06:11,896
Well? I helped deliver
the alien to you, as promised.

735
01:06:12,229 --> 01:06:15,149
Now it's time to keep
your end of the bargain.

736
01:06:16,066 --> 01:06:18,611
You can do your tests on the board...

737
01:06:19,653 --> 01:06:23,491
...but under armed guard
and in my presence only.

738
01:06:23,657 --> 01:06:26,035
Absolutely.

739
01:06:32,666 --> 01:06:35,628
<i>General Hager. Access granted.</i>

740
01:06:58,859 --> 01:07:00,194
The board draws it here.

741
01:07:00,361 --> 01:07:02,363
How do you fight something
that eats planets?

742
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:05,366
We have to get to the board
and lead it away from here.

743
01:07:05,574 --> 01:07:08,494
Well, do you think the general
will go for that?

744
01:07:08,661 --> 01:07:10,287
He'll have no choice.

745
01:07:13,457 --> 01:07:14,834
Thank you, general.

746
01:07:15,709 --> 01:07:17,044
But I'm afraid...

747
01:07:18,003 --> 01:07:19,171
...the truth is...

748
01:07:20,005 --> 01:07:22,383
...sometimes Reed is right.

749
01:07:26,137 --> 01:07:27,638
What...?

750
01:07:40,151 --> 01:07:42,194
Hey, you. Come here.

751
01:07:42,695 --> 01:07:44,697
Let me ask you something.

752
01:08:46,801 --> 01:08:48,427
Nice.

753
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,225
Crap.

754
01:09:01,232 --> 01:09:02,775
Ben!

755
01:09:06,779 --> 01:09:08,781
Okay, that one hurt.

756
01:09:09,448 --> 01:09:12,076
- Where's Reed?
- Back here.

757
01:09:23,129 --> 01:09:24,130
My bad.

758
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,140
Reed.

759
01:09:38,352 --> 01:09:41,313
Victor. We've gotta get it back.

760
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:44,191
We need to get the Surfer.
He understands its power.

761
01:09:44,358 --> 01:09:48,529
Even if we break him out of this place,
how are we gonna catch up to Victor?

762
01:09:49,738 --> 01:09:51,282
Leave that to me.

763
01:10:20,895 --> 01:10:23,189
- Halt!
- Stay where you are!

764
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:29,820
Pal, this is the luckiest day
of your life.

765
01:10:33,073 --> 01:10:36,368
What the hell is going on?
Where is General Hager?

766
01:10:36,577 --> 01:10:37,703
He's dead.

767
01:10:37,995 --> 01:10:40,581
And if we don't get him out of here,
we'll all be.

768
01:10:40,831 --> 01:10:42,416
Frankie...

769
01:10:44,502 --> 01:10:48,589
...the world is literally at stake here.
You have to trust us.

770
01:10:50,549 --> 01:10:51,717
Please.

771
01:10:55,012 --> 01:10:57,765
We need to get to the roof.
It should be here by now.

772
01:10:57,932 --> 01:11:00,059
What should be here?

773
01:11:09,276 --> 01:11:11,237
Holy crap!

774
01:11:11,445 --> 01:11:13,030
Reed.

775
01:11:13,197 --> 01:11:16,033
This is by far the coolest thing
you have ever done.

776
01:11:25,751 --> 01:11:27,211
- Hemi?
- Of course.

777
01:11:28,796 --> 01:11:31,465
Okay, Ben, you get inside.
Johnny, you fly behind us.

778
01:11:31,632 --> 01:11:35,052
- You gotta let me fly this.
- I'm the best pilot. I should drive.

779
01:11:35,219 --> 01:11:37,263
- Guys.
- You're lucky if it can carry you.

780
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:39,640
- I can fly circles around you.
- Guys!

781
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:42,977
- Reed.
- Shut up! And move it!

782
01:11:43,144 --> 01:11:44,979
I'm driving.

783
01:11:47,857 --> 01:11:49,650
Flame on!

784
01:11:56,115 --> 01:12:00,619
Okay. We're now officially enemies
of the United States of America.

785
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:03,622
Victor is out there somewhere
with unlimited power.

786
01:12:03,789 --> 01:12:06,417
And we've got a giant
intergalactic force...

787
01:12:06,584 --> 01:12:11,338
...that's about to destroy our planet in
less than 24 hours. Did I miss anything?

788
01:12:12,173 --> 01:12:15,759
I've locked on Victor's energy trail.
He's headed over Southeast China.

789
01:12:15,926 --> 01:12:17,470
Hang on.

790
01:12:21,599 --> 01:12:23,434
Norrin Radd.

791
01:12:24,935 --> 01:12:29,482
- What?
- I was once called Norrin Radd.

792
01:12:30,191 --> 01:12:32,818
Norrin, we'll need your help
to save our world.

793
01:12:33,319 --> 01:12:35,279
Do you understand?

794
01:12:40,534 --> 01:12:42,036
What the hell was that?

795
01:12:43,996 --> 01:12:48,209
Victor, the board is drawing the
Destroyer here. You have to give it up.

796
01:12:48,626 --> 01:12:51,170
You know, I've never
been the giving type, Reed.

797
01:12:51,378 --> 01:12:53,214
Hold on!

798
01:13:07,228 --> 01:13:08,521
We're sitting ducks!

799
01:13:08,729 --> 01:13:10,314
We're gonna have to split up!

800
01:13:10,481 --> 01:13:11,899
- What?
- This ought to be fun!

801
01:13:42,429 --> 01:13:43,764
He's really pissing me off!

802
01:13:50,187 --> 01:13:52,273
Surf's up, metalhead!

803
01:13:55,109 --> 01:13:59,572
Victor, only the Surfer can stop the
Destroyer. But he needs his board.

804
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:02,616
- Come and get it, Richards.
- Victor.

805
01:14:07,455 --> 01:14:10,749
Let's all go for a spin!

806
01:14:49,330 --> 01:14:50,956
Norrin!

807
01:14:53,042 --> 01:14:54,293
Catch.

808
01:15:08,682 --> 01:15:10,476
Sue!

809
01:15:15,189 --> 01:15:16,690
Oh, my God.

810
01:15:16,857 --> 01:15:18,484
Sue. Sue.

811
01:15:18,692 --> 01:15:20,945
- Oh, God.
- Johnny, don't touch her!

812
01:15:24,824 --> 01:15:26,033
Oh, God. Oh, God.

813
01:15:26,283 --> 01:15:28,327
You need to find a way
to get the board.

814
01:15:28,536 --> 01:15:30,996
- Sue, I...
- Okay.

815
01:15:39,338 --> 01:15:40,589
He is here.

816
01:15:48,848 --> 01:15:50,182
Reed?

817
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:52,351
Reed.

818
01:15:54,228 --> 01:15:57,857
Victor's gotta have a pulse emitter
linking him to his board.

819
01:15:58,023 --> 01:16:01,485
We take it out,
we can separate him from his board.

820
01:16:01,694 --> 01:16:02,903
He's too strong for me.

821
01:16:03,112 --> 01:16:05,072
I could whale on him if I get close...

822
01:16:05,239 --> 01:16:08,159
...but he could see me coming
from a mile away.

823
01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:11,745
It would take all of us.

824
01:16:12,913 --> 01:16:14,373
Or maybe just one of us.

825
01:16:19,170 --> 01:16:21,714
We don't know
what it could do to you.

826
01:16:22,423 --> 01:16:24,508
Let's not make this about me.

827
01:16:46,572 --> 01:16:47,907
To quote a friend of mine...

828
01:16:48,866 --> 01:16:50,201
...it's clobbering time.

829
01:17:47,174 --> 01:17:49,135
You ain't going down fighting, kid.

830
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:52,263
Not without me.

831
01:19:30,111 --> 01:19:32,113
You've gotta go.

832
01:20:02,393 --> 01:20:05,146
Treasure each moment with her.

833
01:20:05,354 --> 01:20:07,398
And tell her she was right.

834
01:20:08,149 --> 01:20:11,569
We do have a choice.

835
01:20:37,803 --> 01:20:39,305
Thought you could use a hand.

836
01:20:44,143 --> 01:20:45,478
Oh, my God.

837
01:21:15,466 --> 01:21:17,718
Why isn't it working?

838
01:21:18,552 --> 01:21:20,346
We were too late.

839
01:21:28,938 --> 01:21:31,190
I will no longer serve.

840
01:21:33,192 --> 01:21:38,239
This is the end for us both.

841
01:22:59,612 --> 01:23:01,071
Hi.

842
01:23:03,657 --> 01:23:05,284
Hi.

843
01:23:09,288 --> 01:23:10,831
What did I miss?

844
01:23:20,007 --> 01:23:21,759
Hey! Hey!

845
01:23:21,926 --> 01:23:24,970
- He did it.
- Great job, kid.

846
01:23:26,472 --> 01:23:29,100
Hey, wait. I'm not changing.

847
01:23:29,433 --> 01:23:31,852
Hey, that's right.

848
01:23:32,019 --> 01:23:33,854
Great.

849
01:23:34,438 --> 01:23:37,817
Okay, now you're making
me uncomfortable.

850
01:23:57,211 --> 01:23:59,547
So I guess this is it.

851
01:24:00,005 --> 01:24:02,383
We all go our separate ways.

852
01:24:02,883 --> 01:24:04,385
No.

853
01:24:05,136 --> 01:24:06,804
- No?
- No.

854
01:24:06,971 --> 01:24:08,389
- No?
- Lf not for the team...

855
01:24:08,597 --> 01:24:10,182
...the whole world would be gone.

856
01:24:10,391 --> 01:24:14,728
We can't run away from our
responsibilities. This is who we are.

857
01:24:14,895 --> 01:24:18,023
- That's what I've been saying.
- What about having a normal life?

858
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:20,401
- A family?
- Who says you have to be normal...

859
01:24:20,568 --> 01:24:22,361
...to have a family?

860
01:24:23,529 --> 01:24:28,367
So are you up for another media-circus
wedding? Fifth time's a charm.

861
01:24:28,534 --> 01:24:30,202
No.

862
01:24:32,413 --> 01:24:34,248
I got a better idea.

863
01:24:45,551 --> 01:24:50,431
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
today to join Reed Richards...

864
01:24:50,681 --> 01:24:53,893
...and Sue Storm together in holy...

865
01:24:54,059 --> 01:24:56,604
...matrimony.

866
01:24:56,771 --> 01:24:59,774
- What is it?
- Venice is sinking into the Adriatic.

867
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:01,776
Oh, boy. That's a biggie.

868
01:25:01,942 --> 01:25:04,403
Could we just skip to the end?

869
01:25:04,612 --> 01:25:08,157
- Yeah. The love these two share...
- No, the very end.

870
01:25:08,365 --> 01:25:10,785
Yeah, great. You have the rings?

871
01:25:19,668 --> 01:25:20,711
Oh, yeah.

872
01:25:20,878 --> 01:25:24,465
I now pronounce you man and wife,
and you may kiss the bride.

873
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:33,766
- Okay. We should get out of here.
- Yeah.

874
01:25:33,974 --> 01:25:36,268
- Gotta go, hon.
- Okay.

875
01:25:40,564 --> 01:25:41,982
I have to throw the bouquet.

876
01:25:42,942 --> 01:25:44,610
Ready?

877
01:25:53,494 --> 01:25:55,788
Heads up, Johnny.

878
01:26:06,090 --> 01:26:07,925
Sorry.

879
01:26:09,009 --> 01:26:10,136
Reflex.

880
01:31:47,807 --> 01:31:49,809
