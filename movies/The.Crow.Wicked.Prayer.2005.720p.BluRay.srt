1
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:02,649
Like some more salsa with that?

2
00:03:03,858 --> 00:03:08,905
Get back to work, or I'm docking
your severance pay when the mine closes.

3
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:14,994
I fear that you have awakened a sleeping
giant, and filled him with a terrible resolve.

4
00:03:15,036 --> 00:03:17,497
Get back to work.

5
00:04:56,262 --> 00:05:03,019
Save our jobs. Save our jobs.
Save our jobs. Save our jobs.

6
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:18,284
<i>Attention all units.
Riot in progress at Lake Ravasu Mine.</i>

7
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:21,287
<i>Gunfire on the scene.</i>

8
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:29,837
<i>- Cover his face. Cover his face.
- Cover him up now.</i>

9
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:44,287
He who liveth by the sword
shall die by the sword.

10
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,916
He who liveth
by the sword shall die by the sword.

11
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,462
An eye for an eye
will make you blind.

12
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:57,508
An eye for an eye
will make you blind.

13
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:02,221
He who liveth by the sword
shall die by the sword...

14
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:17,361
<i>- Somebody shot the priest!
- Get him!</i>

15
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:20,114
<i>Get the gun, get the gun...</i>

16
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:25,912
With War, there is no
substitute for victory.

17
00:07:26,954 --> 00:07:28,915
Lead the way, Mr. Crash.

18
00:07:51,145 --> 00:07:53,272
It's your wedding night,
you dirty old bastard.

19
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:56,942
So, this one time,
I'm buying the hookers.

20
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,868
<i>Cuidado, homes.</i>

21
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:09,664
Your local Satanic cult is back in black.

22
00:08:11,332 --> 00:08:13,709
The Four Horsemen ride again.

23
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,092
No prisoners, homes.

24
00:08:33,187 --> 00:08:35,940
Just kidding.

25
00:08:46,575 --> 00:08:48,577
How's it going, Lo?

26
00:08:48,619 --> 00:08:50,913
Better, now that I'm with you.

27
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:56,710
- Will you marry me, Lola Byrne?
- Till death do us part, Luc Crash.

28
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:16,730
<i>Praise the Lord,
it's almost time for Jesus to rise up.</i>

29
00:09:16,814 --> 00:09:21,819
<i>As preacher, I expect the flock to be in
the church tomorrow on Easter morning.</i>

30
00:09:21,902 --> 00:09:26,907
<i>As tribal chairman, I invite you
to party the night away at Rave-N Fest.</i>

31
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:32,329
He found himself in mystic places.

32
00:09:32,413 --> 00:09:35,332
<i>Tonight, as we celebrate
the birth of the crow.</i>

33
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,294
<i>and the coming
of our Raven Aztec Casino.</i>

34
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,921
<i>Hallelujah. hallelujah!</i>

35
00:09:40,963 --> 00:09:43,174
<i>Praise Jesus!</i>

36
00:09:43,257 --> 00:09:47,094
<i>And don't forget to eat
your 12 lucky grapes for dinner.</i>

37
00:09:47,178 --> 00:09:49,471
<i>One for each month of the coming year.</i>

38
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:54,602
<i>This Spanish custom worked wonders
for our conquistador conquerors.</i>

39
00:09:54,685 --> 00:09:56,687
<i>and it'll work wonders for you.</i>

40
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:01,483
<i>'Cause the name of our lucky tribe
is the Raven Aztecs.</i>

41
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:10,743
Barnaby, there comes
a time in every man's life

42
00:10:10,826 --> 00:10:15,789
when he's just got to face the fact that the
contents of his fridge just ain't cutting it.

43
00:10:15,873 --> 00:10:20,252
<i>And now, I want to introduce
our shaman and my daughter.</i>

44
00:10:20,336 --> 00:10:22,713
<i>Lily Ignites The Dawn.</i>

45
00:10:53,577 --> 00:10:56,121
In times like these.

46
00:10:57,122 --> 00:11:00,125
<i>When our community is divided.</i>

47
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:03,253
<i>and we hear calls for vengeance.</i>

48
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:07,174
It's important to remember the old stories.

49
00:11:10,886 --> 00:11:13,889
Killer! Murderer!

50
00:11:13,931 --> 00:11:15,766
<i>We are told
that when someone dies...</i>

51
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:17,184
Convict!

52
00:11:17,267 --> 00:11:20,979
The crow carries their soul
to the land of the dead.

53
00:11:21,063 --> 00:11:24,108
<i>- Then sometimes, just sometimes...
- You hear me? I called you convict.</i>

54
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:25,943
<i>- the crow can bring that soul back...
- Shit, here he comes.</i>

55
00:11:26,026 --> 00:11:29,113
<i>to release it of its burden.</i>

56
00:11:29,196 --> 00:11:32,366
To put the wrong things right.

57
00:11:37,162 --> 00:11:40,374
<i>What gives the crow his strength?</i>

58
00:11:40,457 --> 00:11:42,126
<i>Not hatred.</i>

59
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:43,919
<i>or bitterness.</i>

60
00:11:44,002 --> 00:11:45,629
<i>or anger.</i>

61
00:11:48,257 --> 00:11:50,968
His strength is love.

62
00:12:19,746 --> 00:12:21,540
Come on, baby.

63
00:12:26,503 --> 00:12:29,006
Rave-N Fest? No.

64
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:30,924
No. Never again.

65
00:12:31,008 --> 00:12:34,678
Come on. I want them
to see you through my eyes.

66
00:12:36,597 --> 00:12:38,932
Lily.

67
00:12:39,016 --> 00:12:41,351
I'm off parole at midnight.

68
00:12:43,478 --> 00:12:46,607
We can hit the coast
before anybody notices.

69
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,693
I want them to notice.

70
00:12:49,776 --> 00:12:51,945
I do.

71
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:54,031
I love you, Jimmy!

72
00:12:54,114 --> 00:12:57,451
You put too much faith in people.

73
00:12:57,951 --> 00:13:02,080
I believe in a lot of things.
Even you, Jimmy Cuervo.

74
00:13:02,164 --> 00:13:05,167
I am what I am.

75
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:10,589
If you want to escape from here. you gotta
let it go. You gotta let it all go.

76
00:13:10,631 --> 00:13:13,634
I can't. Not without you.

77
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,514
Now, that kind of belief
will get you locked up.

78
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,934
Set me free, Warden.

79
00:13:24,102 --> 00:13:27,481
You know what time I get off.
Don't be late.

80
00:13:42,537 --> 00:13:45,624
Lily, I'm gonna let it all go.

81
00:13:45,707 --> 00:13:48,377
I swear on your perfect blue eyes.

82
00:13:57,552 --> 00:13:59,137
Lily!

83
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,434
Have you lost your mind, sis?

84
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:16,196
It's a great day to be alive, ain't it?

85
00:14:47,352 --> 00:14:50,105
It's takedown time.

86
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:07,098
Spoke to your parole officer today.

87
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:10,769
Oh, nice suit, white trash.

88
00:16:10,852 --> 00:16:13,188
Did you rob a grave?

89
00:16:14,814 --> 00:16:18,276
Your jurisdiction ends
on that side of the road, asshole.

90
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,239
There isn't much people
on either side of the road can agree on.

91
00:16:22,322 --> 00:16:26,326
Except that nobody likes you,
Jimmy Cuervo.

92
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:29,663
Goddamn, I guess I'll fire my publicist.

93
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:39,172
You better be stopping in to say goodbye.

94
00:16:54,854 --> 00:16:57,440
Are you fucking kidding me?

95
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:15,000
You're lucky.

96
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:18,211
Bullet's still in your hand, asshole.

97
00:17:21,881 --> 00:17:25,510
Come midnight tonight,
you're free to go.

98
00:17:25,593 --> 00:17:27,637
She's not.

99
00:17:49,576 --> 00:17:51,745
Lil?

100
00:17:51,828 --> 00:17:53,371
Lily?

101
00:17:53,538 --> 00:17:55,540
Lily?

102
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:01,504
Oh, hell... I'm just gonna say it.

103
00:18:01,588 --> 00:18:03,923
Lily Ignites The Dawn...

104
00:18:05,341 --> 00:18:07,677
will you marry me?

105
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:14,851
La la la la laa...

106
00:18:14,934 --> 00:18:17,771
- Lily?
- La la

107
00:18:17,854 --> 00:18:21,149
La la la

108
00:18:21,232 --> 00:18:24,152
La la

109
00:18:25,695 --> 00:18:27,197
La

110
00:18:28,531 --> 00:18:31,659
Roses? Lilies would have been better.

111
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,954
But hey, it's your funeral.

112
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:41,753
And you're late, Injun lover.

113
00:18:41,794 --> 00:18:46,257
- Come on.
- Nobody keeps the Grim Reaper waiting.

114
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:49,636
- Luc!
- Blue-eyed Injun.

115
00:18:49,677 --> 00:18:52,472
And a cold-hearted killer.

116
00:18:53,223 --> 00:18:56,184
Just what the witch doctor ordered.

117
00:18:56,684 --> 00:19:00,647
"Romeo, oh Romeo.
wherefore art thou Romeo?"

118
00:19:02,273 --> 00:19:04,567
Looks like Juliet's left hanging.

119
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,655
<i>Hang these, you bitch.</i>

120
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:11,866
Ugh, God!

121
00:19:17,121 --> 00:19:21,334
I never had the option
to love someone like you.

122
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,051
Is she a firecracker or what?

123
00:19:30,093 --> 00:19:33,721
- Didn't I tell you, Lo?
- Yes, Luc. You told me.

124
00:19:34,597 --> 00:19:36,891
Appetizer was tasty.

125
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:39,018
Bring on the main dish.

126
00:19:41,938 --> 00:19:44,899
She doesn't deserve this.

127
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,401
Please.

128
00:19:46,484 --> 00:19:48,861
Please! Luc!

129
00:19:48,945 --> 00:19:52,073
I always liked you, kid.

130
00:19:53,783 --> 00:19:56,202
You should have just stayed
on your side of the road.

131
00:19:56,286 --> 00:19:58,246
<i>Perdoneme.</i>

132
00:20:00,707 --> 00:20:03,084
- I'm sorry.
- Jimmy...

133
00:20:13,094 --> 00:20:15,305
The object of war
is not to die for your beliefs.

134
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:18,725
But to make the other
poor bastards die for theirs.

135
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:20,935
Ever since we were kids in school.

136
00:20:22,645 --> 00:20:26,607
I always thought
your eyes were so pretty, Lily.

137
00:20:27,483 --> 00:20:30,319
They've seen things.

138
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:32,447
Mine?

139
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,658
They've never seen shit.

140
00:20:35,742 --> 00:20:41,956
Sometimes, if your eyes can't see,
you have to trade 'em in for a new pair.

141
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,002
Time's a-wasting, Lo.

142
00:21:01,517 --> 00:21:03,978
Go in peace with our love.

143
00:21:04,979 --> 00:21:08,107
<i>You will always be in our hearts.</i>

144
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:11,569
<i>Your eyes will watch over us.</i>

145
00:21:11,611 --> 00:21:14,405
<i>Your spirit will always be nearby.</i>

146
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:19,827
<i>We will treasure your memory
until we meet again.</i>

147
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:21,829
Dude, that's Lily.

148
00:21:22,997 --> 00:21:25,041
Take flight, Mother.

149
00:21:26,876 --> 00:21:29,212
Magnificent fuckers, aren't they?

150
00:21:29,253 --> 00:21:31,047
You wanted to bone her since you were 12.

151
00:21:31,088 --> 00:21:32,507
Yeah.

152
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:36,969
- Keep talking shit about my girl.
- Go get 'em, Tonto.

153
00:22:00,785 --> 00:22:05,748
"By sun's dying flame.
and Hades' wicked might"

154
00:22:05,831 --> 00:22:09,335
"I peer into the darkness"

155
00:22:09,418 --> 00:22:13,047
"To take hold of the light"

156
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:37,572
Now I have the eyes of a shaman
to unlock the spell.

157
00:22:37,655 --> 00:22:42,827
By sunup, you'll be Satan
and that bitch's tribe will be history.

158
00:22:47,915 --> 00:22:49,917
Such a shame.

159
00:22:53,879 --> 00:22:58,801
Without her eyes,
she'll be lost in the spirit world forever.

160
00:23:01,887 --> 00:23:04,223
Luc.

161
00:23:04,307 --> 00:23:05,516
Luc.

162
00:23:09,103 --> 00:23:13,858
You are gonna fucking die.

163
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:18,988
Ah, Jimbo, you're breaking my heart.

164
00:23:29,248 --> 00:23:32,084
Hearts were made to be broken.

165
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,949
"The killer's heart by love redeemed"

166
00:24:07,286 --> 00:24:09,872
"In Satan's claw like ruby gleamed"

167
00:24:57,086 --> 00:24:59,088
I feel good.

168
00:25:10,891 --> 00:25:13,310
Pestilence? Famine?

169
00:25:14,311 --> 00:25:19,567
Take these rags to the dump and burn 'em.

170
00:26:03,235 --> 00:26:06,405
This place has been tearing me down.

171
00:26:06,488 --> 00:26:09,825
But I'm finally crawling to the top.

172
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:22,338
Shit. That's the freezer
Momma used to lock me up in.

173
00:26:24,882 --> 00:26:29,553
She'd say. "It's damnation in there.
You ain't never coming out."

174
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:39,229
Damnation sure is a happy place.

175
00:26:40,647 --> 00:26:42,649
Yeah, maybe.

176
00:26:44,902 --> 00:26:47,404
If you're dead.

177
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:55,764
Kick us down a sign.

178
00:27:55,848 --> 00:27:58,976
What do you see with your new eyes?

179
00:28:04,857 --> 00:28:07,693
I see the devil rising up.

180
00:28:07,734 --> 00:28:11,113
He's gonna make
all your dreams come true.

181
00:28:18,954 --> 00:28:23,584
Eat up. Partake in the deviled ham.
eat of the deviled eggs, and for dessert.

182
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:26,670
Feast on devil's food cake.

183
00:28:28,589 --> 00:28:30,716
<i>Al flambeau.</i>

184
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:35,345
It's all been dusted
with Lola's magical peyote mix.

185
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,442
What is this?

186
00:28:50,736 --> 00:28:52,446
Hm?

187
00:28:52,529 --> 00:28:54,906
Have we all forgotten...

188
00:28:57,117 --> 00:29:00,037
whose side you're on?

189
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,498
Who's been holding you down?

190
00:29:03,582 --> 00:29:08,920
Who's gonna shut down the mines.
putting your families out of work.

191
00:29:08,962 --> 00:29:12,215
Just so they can open up a casino?

192
00:29:16,386 --> 00:29:18,388
War.

193
00:29:20,265 --> 00:29:22,934
Your people, they were enslaved.

194
00:29:23,977 --> 00:29:25,228
Hm?

195
00:29:25,312 --> 00:29:28,649
Why ain't there a goddamn
government-backed casino

196
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:32,069
in every street corner of the 'hood? Hm?

197
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:40,118
For every one of them that dies.
ten of us may die.

198
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,206
But in the end, it's they
who will tire of War.

199
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:46,291
Now you're talking.

200
00:29:48,001 --> 00:29:49,461
Famine.

201
00:29:49,628 --> 00:29:54,091
Famine. You're the nearest thing
to Montezuma for 500 miles.

202
00:29:54,174 --> 00:29:56,885
How come you ain't got
a piece of that Aztec Casino pie?

203
00:29:56,968 --> 00:30:00,931
- Hell. yes. I'd eat that shit up.
- Yeah!

204
00:30:01,014 --> 00:30:02,349
- Pestilence.
- Huh?

205
00:30:02,391 --> 00:30:05,727
Pestilence. Do you want to be
a real cowboy?

206
00:30:05,811 --> 00:30:11,900
How long you got to live before that toxic
brew spreads cancer through your gut?

207
00:30:12,901 --> 00:30:16,196
Long enough to see the Injuns burn.

208
00:30:17,072 --> 00:30:19,074
Tonight...

209
00:30:20,075 --> 00:30:22,619
Satan's gonna walk in my shoes.

210
00:30:23,662 --> 00:30:26,706
'Cause tonight, we'll make 'em hurt.

211
00:30:26,748 --> 00:30:28,792
One by one.

212
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:31,753
Tonight is about one thing.

213
00:30:32,629 --> 00:30:34,047
Revenge.

214
00:30:34,256 --> 00:30:36,633
Revenge.

215
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,929
And who needs a wedding invite?
Don't be late.

216
00:30:41,012 --> 00:30:45,058
We have to do this before sunrise
or the power is lost.

217
00:30:45,142 --> 00:30:48,228
And we registered for one gift.
A sacrificial virgin

218
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,856
to seal our wedding vows.

219
00:31:12,252 --> 00:31:17,340
Pestilence. Go down to the bar
and score some more peyote.

220
00:31:21,595 --> 00:31:24,180
I'm gonna go visit an old friend.

221
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:55,146
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

222
00:33:20,338 --> 00:33:22,966
Shut up!

223
00:33:49,284 --> 00:33:52,537
Oh, my God. What have I done?

224
00:33:52,579 --> 00:33:56,124
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

225
00:34:24,736 --> 00:34:27,071
You believed me when nobody else would.

226
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:41,586
For once in my life. I wasn't alone.

227
00:35:13,952 --> 00:35:15,370
I always liked you, kid.

228
00:35:15,453 --> 00:35:19,499
<i>But you should have stayed
on your side of the road.</i>

229
00:35:36,557 --> 00:35:38,309
Yeah, cut her eyes out!

230
00:35:38,393 --> 00:35:40,478
Cut her eyes out!

231
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:45,149
That heart's beating.

232
00:36:12,885 --> 00:36:14,887
What am I?

233
00:36:34,782 --> 00:36:37,243
Hey, Barnaby.

234
00:37:22,872 --> 00:37:26,500
They're gonna love you at Rave-N Fest.

235
00:37:26,584 --> 00:37:28,544
I love you.

236
00:38:43,077 --> 00:38:45,162
You're not a killer.

237
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,749
Murderer!

238
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:13,399
Call the tribal council.
We have to have a meeting.

239
00:39:13,482 --> 00:39:16,527
Tell my father Cuervo's done it again.

240
00:39:39,925 --> 00:39:42,803
If there's anyone here
who objects to this couple...

241
00:39:42,887 --> 00:39:45,723
<i>La la laa. La la laa</i>

242
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,767
La le lee. La la laa

243
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:52,062
<i>- Speak now, or forever...
- Hey, Luc.</i>

244
00:39:52,146 --> 00:39:56,734
I bet you that virgin bride
tastes just like cherry pie.

245
00:39:58,027 --> 00:40:00,571
Here, don't lose your place.

246
00:40:00,654 --> 00:40:02,156
"Out of..." What?

247
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:04,825
Good call, hawkeye.

248
00:40:12,666 --> 00:40:15,169
Hello, Moses.

249
00:40:15,753 --> 00:40:18,172
I... I don't want any trouble.

250
00:40:18,255 --> 00:40:21,383
You've done well for yourself.

251
00:40:21,842 --> 00:40:26,138
I've waited a long time
for you to find success.

252
00:40:27,014 --> 00:40:29,141
- They're all useless sluts.
- Please, son.

253
00:40:29,183 --> 00:40:32,186
The only thing I found is God.

254
00:40:33,562 --> 00:40:39,360
Who do you think stuffed your collections
box every time the mortgage was overdue?

255
00:40:39,443 --> 00:40:41,070
God?

256
00:40:41,153 --> 00:40:45,282
I wanted you to taste success.

257
00:40:45,366 --> 00:40:47,409
So I could take it away from you.

258
00:40:47,493 --> 00:40:50,371
Who are you?

259
00:40:50,412 --> 00:40:55,417
I'll tell you for 47 dollars and 66 cents.

260
00:40:57,586 --> 00:40:59,630
Don't you see the resemblance

261
00:40:59,713 --> 00:41:04,927
to the preacher you shot down
for the contents of his collection box?

262
00:41:05,886 --> 00:41:08,597
Wait. I paid for my crime.

263
00:41:10,015 --> 00:41:13,269
I did all this for your father,
to make amends.

264
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:16,939
I'm doing his work.

265
00:41:17,022 --> 00:41:18,983
I've changed.

266
00:41:19,066 --> 00:41:21,026
Hear that?

267
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:23,195
He's changed.

268
00:41:23,278 --> 00:41:26,407
Moses,
the wedding food is ready.

269
00:41:26,448 --> 00:41:28,117
Shh.

270
00:41:30,786 --> 00:41:32,746
Don't hurt her.

271
00:41:32,788 --> 00:41:35,457
<i>Hey, Lo.</i>

272
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:37,876
What? What are you doing?
What are you gonna do...

273
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,628
Pick it up.

274
00:41:39,712 --> 00:41:44,174
If you shoot me first, maybe she'll live.

275
00:41:44,258 --> 00:41:47,219
<i>Moses! Moses!</i>

276
00:41:47,302 --> 00:41:49,596
<i>No! No!</i>

277
00:41:49,638 --> 00:41:53,684
<i>- I've changed.
- Moses, I need you...</i>

278
00:41:53,767 --> 00:41:55,894
Get away!

279
00:41:56,895 --> 00:41:59,940
Moses, help me!

280
00:42:00,024 --> 00:42:04,111
<i>- Go on.
- I won't do it. I've changed.</i>

281
00:42:04,194 --> 00:42:07,239
<i>Moses, help!</i>

282
00:42:09,324 --> 00:42:11,326
You bastard!

283
00:42:15,497 --> 00:42:19,668
<i>- Get out of here and call the police!
- Moses...</i>

284
00:42:22,755 --> 00:42:24,548
Moses!

285
00:42:27,259 --> 00:42:29,678
Good God...

286
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:35,184
Moses, oh. God.

287
00:42:50,407 --> 00:42:52,367
People don't change.

288
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:58,332
Witnesses.

289
00:43:00,793 --> 00:43:02,878
Luc?

290
00:43:05,589 --> 00:43:07,633
I'm full.

291
00:43:07,716 --> 00:43:10,093
You take the leftovers.

292
00:43:10,135 --> 00:43:12,638
But leave the wife to suffer.

293
00:43:12,721 --> 00:43:16,725
Luc, where are you going with this?
Let's just go, baby.

294
00:43:16,808 --> 00:43:19,520
Homeboy's just fucking with you.

295
00:43:20,604 --> 00:43:25,526
- Aren't you?
- Blood alone spins the wheels of history.

296
00:43:36,662 --> 00:43:39,581
So I said to him.
"Get your own whore!"

297
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,967
<i>The man in black
rode down on a horse</i>

298
00:43:51,468 --> 00:43:55,555
<i>What course they'd run,
he dare not recall</i>

299
00:43:56,556 --> 00:43:59,518
<i>He'd become a creature,
thirsty and hungry...</i>

300
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:03,522
They just ain't smart enough
to stay down where they belong.

301
00:44:03,605 --> 00:44:04,815
<i>Kill them all</i>

302
00:44:04,898 --> 00:44:11,321
They got to spread their
little wings and fly up into the light.

303
00:44:11,405 --> 00:44:14,992
<i>Perhaps their pain
would help him remember</i>

304
00:44:16,076 --> 00:44:19,121
The package you ordered is on its way.

305
00:44:19,204 --> 00:44:21,331
Cowboy.

306
00:44:23,583 --> 00:44:27,254
You said the peyote'd
be here before dessert.

307
00:44:28,255 --> 00:44:30,590
And if it ain't...

308
00:44:31,091 --> 00:44:34,344
your head becomes
a portal to the fifth dimension.

309
00:44:35,637 --> 00:44:38,140
Get it?

310
00:44:43,437 --> 00:44:47,858
You see that?
There's a new sheriff in town.

311
00:44:52,779 --> 00:44:55,115
<i>The creature sat naked...</i>

312
00:44:57,617 --> 00:45:01,663
<i>He held his heart in his hand,
and he ate of it</i>

313
00:45:02,581 --> 00:45:06,543
<i>The man in black asked,
"Is it good. friend?"</i>

314
00:45:06,626 --> 00:45:09,546
Get off me, you damn hallucination.

315
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:14,301
<i>"But I like it, because it is bitter"</i>

316
00:45:16,136 --> 00:45:19,139
<i>"And because it is my heart"</i>

317
00:45:26,396 --> 00:45:28,148
Boo.

318
00:45:45,582 --> 00:45:49,836
I guess Famine's momma
was wrong about that freezer.

319
00:45:51,713 --> 00:45:53,799
Where's fucking Luc?

320
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:59,596
He owes me two lifetimes
and a set of perfect blue eyes.

321
00:46:04,267 --> 00:46:06,186
We misjudged you.

322
00:46:06,228 --> 00:46:10,315
For an Injun-loving heartless convict.

323
00:46:10,357 --> 00:46:13,276
You sure got a lot of life in you.

324
00:46:14,694 --> 00:46:16,446
What I got in me...

325
00:46:19,407 --> 00:46:21,034
ain't life.

326
00:46:22,744 --> 00:46:24,871
Join the club.

327
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:40,178
Ow!

328
00:47:08,248 --> 00:47:11,209
"Am I a man who dreamt
he was a butterfly?"

329
00:47:15,672 --> 00:47:18,758
"Or a butterfly who dreamt he was a man?"

330
00:47:36,443 --> 00:47:38,945
I'm afraid of what I've become.

331
00:47:40,071 --> 00:47:42,824
You tell 'em they should be too.

332
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:51,041
"Oh, hell. I'm just gonna say it."

333
00:47:52,042 --> 00:47:54,377
"Will you marry me?"

334
00:48:44,844 --> 00:48:47,222
Oh, shit!

335
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,294
You're not a killer.

336
00:49:29,097 --> 00:49:32,559
Back when Lake Ravasu
had a lake.

337
00:49:33,059 --> 00:49:36,396
<i>I used to take her out
on the water fishing.</i>

338
00:49:37,105 --> 00:49:39,899
Time stood still when she laughed.

339
00:49:44,112 --> 00:49:48,700
They said smelting
wouldn't make much mess.

340
00:49:49,951 --> 00:49:52,287
So I let 'em drain the lake.

341
00:49:53,913 --> 00:49:57,000
And when the miners came. I told Lily:

342
00:49:57,083 --> 00:50:01,921
<i>"Mi hija, stay away from 'em.
Stay on your side of the road."</i>

343
00:50:03,715 --> 00:50:05,675
She knew better.

344
00:50:07,927 --> 00:50:10,430
Dear Heavenly Father...

345
00:50:12,932 --> 00:50:13,933
Let us pray.

346
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:18,563
<i>Give us the strength to forgive.</i>

347
00:50:19,772 --> 00:50:22,400
<i>And drain this outrage from our hearts.</i>

348
00:50:22,483 --> 00:50:25,570
You will always be in our hearts.

349
00:50:26,613 --> 00:50:29,240
<i>Your eyes will watch over us.</i>

350
00:50:31,618 --> 00:50:34,120
<i>Your spirit will always be nearby.</i>

351
00:50:36,873 --> 00:50:39,083
Baby, I miss you so much.

352
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:41,169
Make your camp here.

353
00:50:44,172 --> 00:50:46,424
What have you done to me?

354
00:50:48,843 --> 00:50:51,304
You made me a fucking monster.

355
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,148
Dad.

356
00:51:03,775 --> 00:51:06,069
Did you catch him yet?

357
00:51:06,152 --> 00:51:07,820
No.

358
00:51:10,156 --> 00:51:13,368
He just took another one down.

359
00:51:13,451 --> 00:51:15,787
At the bar.

360
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:17,872
I'll have the state troopers
set up roadblocks.

361
00:51:17,955 --> 00:51:19,374
No.

362
00:51:19,457 --> 00:51:22,001
No outsiders.

363
00:51:22,085 --> 00:51:24,337
We've seen their kind of justice.

364
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:27,048
They're the ones
that set him free the first time.

365
00:51:27,131 --> 00:51:31,427
But, Dad, our authority ends
at the reservation line.

366
00:51:33,096 --> 00:51:35,681
And we have our kind of justice.

367
00:51:41,395 --> 00:51:47,360
Now let's show the dark prince
our worthiness, pilgrims.

368
00:52:00,873 --> 00:52:03,376
Herd these lambs for slaughter.

369
00:52:03,459 --> 00:52:05,628
Not all of them deserve to die.

370
00:52:05,711 --> 00:52:08,214
"Deserve?"

371
00:52:08,256 --> 00:52:11,092
Did your brothers
deserve to die in mines

372
00:52:11,134 --> 00:52:15,805
that were dug too deep
and too close to the water

373
00:52:15,888 --> 00:52:18,516
so they could profit?

374
00:52:19,517 --> 00:52:21,435
So.

375
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:24,856
We haven't seen the last of War.
now, have we?

376
00:52:25,857 --> 00:52:28,943
Only the dead
have seen the last of War.

377
00:53:01,601 --> 00:53:03,895
I'm not gonna hurt you.

378
00:53:03,978 --> 00:53:06,981
Are you an angel?

379
00:53:07,023 --> 00:53:09,358
Or are you another devil?

380
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,527
I don't know.

381
00:53:11,611 --> 00:53:13,863
Maybe both.

382
00:53:14,864 --> 00:53:20,911
- Come on, I'm gonna get you out of here.
- I can't go out there. I just want to die.

383
00:53:20,995 --> 00:53:23,164
I want to die.

384
00:53:23,247 --> 00:53:26,626
But we can't. Not tonight.

385
00:54:26,102 --> 00:54:27,686
All my life...

386
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:29,480
No!

387
00:54:33,109 --> 00:54:36,529
"I've been pushing down
this fire inside of me.

388
00:54:36,987 --> 00:54:39,115
Jimmy, stop!

389
00:54:39,198 --> 00:54:41,700
It just keeps coming back up.

390
00:54:41,784 --> 00:54:45,121
Jimmy, stop! Jimmy, stop. Stop.

391
00:54:51,544 --> 00:54:54,672
I'm so fucking tired of running.

392
00:55:06,809 --> 00:55:09,436
You didn't think I'd recognize you?

393
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:13,023
After what you did to our son?

394
00:55:13,107 --> 00:55:15,776
Your husband's still alive.

395
00:55:17,403 --> 00:55:20,072
His heart's still beating.

396
00:55:32,543 --> 00:55:34,336
Mary.

397
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:36,046
Moses.

398
00:55:38,424 --> 00:55:41,093
Who are you?

399
00:55:41,177 --> 00:55:43,220
Dear God.

400
00:55:43,304 --> 00:55:46,515
- Maybe a ghost.
- It's a miracle.

401
00:55:55,816 --> 00:55:58,611
I'm sorry.

402
00:55:59,069 --> 00:56:03,657
I don't pretend to understand
what just happened.

403
00:56:03,741 --> 00:56:06,035
But don't ask me to forgive you.

404
00:56:54,083 --> 00:56:56,335
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

405
00:56:58,212 --> 00:57:01,048
Now it's time
for Montezuma's revenge.

406
00:58:00,149 --> 00:58:03,068
I like it.

407
00:58:17,457 --> 00:58:20,460
Didn't we kill that guy?

408
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:37,978
- I don't believe it.
- The truth is, belief's not required.

409
00:58:48,572 --> 00:58:50,741
I know.

410
00:58:50,824 --> 00:58:53,202
He's the crow.
Like in the legend.

411
00:58:57,247 --> 00:58:59,875
God is finally paying attention.

412
00:59:05,172 --> 00:59:07,299
Hello. Jimmy. Jimmy. Jimmy. Jimmy.

413
00:59:07,382 --> 00:59:09,384
Jimmy. Hi.

414
00:59:11,553 --> 00:59:14,348
Tell me, did the blood wash off?

415
00:59:14,431 --> 00:59:18,435
Or did you have to scrub
really, really hard?

416
00:59:18,518 --> 00:59:21,396
Oh. Jimbo, man. Come on, it's me.

417
00:59:21,438 --> 00:59:22,814
Luc.

418
00:59:22,898 --> 00:59:24,399
Huh?

419
00:59:24,441 --> 00:59:28,195
I taught you how to fight.
Showed you how to survive.

420
00:59:28,278 --> 00:59:30,322
And then cut out my heart.

421
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:34,451
So let me get this straight.

422
00:59:34,534 --> 00:59:37,955
I mean,
you're here to make wrong things right.

423
00:59:37,996 --> 00:59:42,167
That's funny,
'cause that's what I'm doing, too.

424
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:44,920
Wait, I have an idea.
Maybe you two should form a club.

425
00:59:44,962 --> 00:59:47,089
Yeah.

426
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:50,759
- I've never been much of a joiner.
- Oh, yeah., sure you are. Come on.

427
00:59:50,842 --> 00:59:53,845
Join us in iniquity. Hm?

428
00:59:53,929 --> 00:59:58,016
You can be my best man.
How are you at wedding speeches?

429
00:59:58,725 --> 01:00:00,852
I'm better at eulogies.

430
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:04,523
That's what I'm talking about.

431
01:00:05,899 --> 01:00:08,777
What's the difference
between me and you? Hm?

432
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:11,780
I'm dead.

433
01:00:20,497 --> 01:00:24,710
Watch out, Jimmy.
He's not the same man he used to be.

434
01:00:35,262 --> 01:00:37,013
War.

435
01:00:47,566 --> 01:00:51,027
What happens to an angel
that loses his wings?

436
01:00:53,071 --> 01:00:54,781
He falls.

437
01:01:21,475 --> 01:01:24,102
"Hellfire rise"

438
01:01:24,186 --> 01:01:26,396
"The heavens drop"

439
01:01:42,162 --> 01:01:45,749
<i>Ten little. Nine little.
Eight little Indians</i>

440
01:01:47,042 --> 01:01:50,545
<i>Seven little. Six little.
Five little Indians</i>

441
01:02:00,513 --> 01:02:04,476
<i>Four little. Three little.
Two little Indians</i>

442
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:08,730
<i>One little Indian boy</i>

443
01:02:30,669 --> 01:02:33,004
It's too quiet in here.

444
01:02:38,677 --> 01:02:40,595
Let's go.

445
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,894
Daddy.

446
01:02:47,978 --> 01:02:52,023
<i>- Where's my daddy?
- Shh. It's gonna be OK.</i>

447
01:03:00,031 --> 01:03:01,992
<i>- What the hell are you doing?
- He took my hearse.</i>

448
01:03:02,075 --> 01:03:03,743
- Who?
- Jimmy Cuervo.

449
01:03:03,785 --> 01:03:06,121
He had a gun
and a Rave-N Fest costume.

450
01:03:06,162 --> 01:03:08,331
Rave-N Fest?

451
01:03:10,125 --> 01:03:12,252
Don't just leave me here like this.

452
01:03:12,293 --> 01:03:14,295
Oh, fuck!

453
01:03:30,937 --> 01:03:35,150
When he was dead,
he saw that he had not lived.

454
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:43,324
Jimmy Cuervo. you're under arrest
for the murder of Lily Ignites The Dawn.

455
01:03:46,578 --> 01:03:49,831
Come on, Tanner. I loved your sister.

456
01:03:51,291 --> 01:03:54,502
- You know I didn't kill her.
- Bullshit.

457
01:03:54,544 --> 01:03:57,672
- I don't believe you.
- Well...

458
01:03:58,923 --> 01:04:00,592
Go ahead. Shoot.

459
01:04:00,675 --> 01:04:03,595
It's loaded this time. I'll kill you.

460
01:04:03,678 --> 01:04:06,848
Man, I wanna die.
I want to die.

461
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:10,768
Do it. Do it, please. Please.

462
01:04:10,852 --> 01:04:13,188
Go ahead.

463
01:04:25,909 --> 01:04:29,245
Join us in iniquity.
You can be my best man.

464
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:43,218
Lily.

465
01:04:43,426 --> 01:04:45,762
Lily.

466
01:04:45,845 --> 01:04:48,014
Killing is easy.

467
01:04:49,015 --> 01:04:51,184
Forgetting is hard.

468
01:05:00,485 --> 01:05:02,946
See you in iniquity.

469
01:05:28,846 --> 01:05:34,143
You think you can keep any crows
from crashing the party?

470
01:05:34,185 --> 01:05:37,563
"Strength lies not in defense
but in attack."

471
01:05:39,899 --> 01:05:43,486
Oh, hurry up, witchy girl.
My biological clock is ticking.

472
01:05:43,569 --> 01:05:45,822
It's not too late to break the spell.

473
01:05:45,863 --> 01:05:47,699
You know, we don't have
to go through with this.

474
01:05:47,782 --> 01:05:51,452
We could just get back in the car,
and head to the coast.

475
01:05:51,536 --> 01:05:53,287
What?

476
01:05:53,371 --> 01:05:55,707
Cold feet, baby?

477
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:58,334
Come on.

478
01:05:59,293 --> 01:06:01,796
What do we have to worry about?

479
01:06:04,048 --> 01:06:05,717
Nothing.

480
01:06:05,758 --> 01:06:09,220
But did we bag a virgin?

481
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:12,181
Our luck is changing.

482
01:06:13,307 --> 01:06:17,228
We just got one
standing on the side of the road.

483
01:06:55,975 --> 01:06:59,979
- What the hell, Luc Crash.
- Yes, Lola Byrne.

484
01:07:02,398 --> 01:07:04,567
Let's get hitched.

485
01:07:17,497 --> 01:07:21,125
- There's no place like home.
- Yeah.

486
01:07:21,209 --> 01:07:25,338
Think your pimp shrimp's
gonna flip out when he sees us?

487
01:07:25,421 --> 01:07:30,051
Let's hope he's sentimental.
You were always bad for business.

488
01:07:30,134 --> 01:07:33,095
I'm not saying
the white weight ain't worth a lookup.

489
01:07:33,179 --> 01:07:37,350
I'm just saying don't buy from Smokey.

490
01:07:38,935 --> 01:07:41,521
Looking good, Carmen.

491
01:07:44,232 --> 01:07:46,859
- You missed me?
- No.

492
01:07:46,943 --> 01:07:52,031
I was counting on never seeing
your ungrateful ass again.

493
01:07:52,114 --> 01:07:55,618
You know, I gave you a chance to get out
of here and make something of yourself.

494
01:07:55,701 --> 01:07:58,246
Nobody ever gave me nothing.

495
01:07:58,329 --> 01:08:00,790
Where is he?

496
01:08:03,209 --> 01:08:05,962
You know what else?
You disrespect my man one more time.

497
01:08:06,045 --> 01:08:09,465
I will split your fucking wig
wide open.

498
01:08:11,384 --> 01:08:13,052
- Fuck you.
- Where's Nino?

499
01:08:13,135 --> 01:08:14,720
Nino!

500
01:08:20,268 --> 01:08:22,270
Check it out.

501
01:08:22,353 --> 01:08:25,273
Crash and Byrne.

502
01:08:25,314 --> 01:08:27,984
Ready to come back
and do some more damage.

503
01:08:28,067 --> 01:08:30,820
You need not reapply. shorty.

504
01:08:30,903 --> 01:08:33,072
I got standards.

505
01:08:33,114 --> 01:08:36,867
Good to see you. Nino.
Dig that coat.

506
01:08:38,536 --> 01:08:41,372
It's El Nino.

507
01:08:41,455 --> 01:08:44,208
Get it right, crackerjack.

508
01:08:47,169 --> 01:08:49,463
Some respect.

509
01:08:50,673 --> 01:08:53,050
I'm moving up in the world.

510
01:08:53,384 --> 01:08:55,469
Well, all right.

511
01:08:56,345 --> 01:08:59,307
If we're gonna do this thing.

512
01:08:59,348 --> 01:09:01,684
Give me my book back.

513
01:09:02,685 --> 01:09:07,148
I stole it fair and square.
Plus, you never had the eyes to use it.

514
01:09:07,189 --> 01:09:09,567
But now I do.

515
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:13,321
- And I ain't your shorty no more.
- Don't undercut me, shorty.

516
01:09:13,362 --> 01:09:16,532
You stole the keys to Daddy's car.

517
01:09:16,615 --> 01:09:20,536
But you can't handle the horsepower.

518
01:09:20,578 --> 01:09:24,123
Now, what's it gonna be, homey?

519
01:09:24,206 --> 01:09:27,084
You want to be Satan, or what?

520
01:09:29,211 --> 01:09:31,672
Lo?

521
01:09:31,756 --> 01:09:34,550
The book.

522
01:09:34,592 --> 01:09:36,761
Kiss it, bitch.

523
01:09:43,059 --> 01:09:45,019
All right.

524
01:09:57,656 --> 01:09:59,617
- We better do something.
- Don't make a move.

525
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:01,368
I want justice for my daughter.

526
01:10:01,452 --> 01:10:04,747
- We can't just sit here.
- We wait for Cuervo.

527
01:10:16,884 --> 01:10:18,928
How is it you're a virgin?

528
01:10:19,011 --> 01:10:21,764
I guess I'm just old-fashioned.

529
01:10:21,847 --> 01:10:23,140
And I was...

530
01:10:23,224 --> 01:10:26,644
I was saving myself
for somebody special.

531
01:10:29,146 --> 01:10:31,273
Hands off.

532
01:10:32,107 --> 01:10:34,610
We are gathered here.

533
01:10:35,569 --> 01:10:38,072
<i>Oh, lust. Oh, hatred.</i>

534
01:10:38,155 --> 01:10:40,991
<i>Gluttony. Greed. Avarice.</i>

535
01:10:41,075 --> 01:10:45,162
<i>And some other real deep heavy shit.</i>

536
01:10:58,175 --> 01:11:01,303
Oh, Satan. What's up, bones?

537
01:11:02,513 --> 01:11:08,561
This is mack daddy. El Nino.
calling you up, man.

538
01:11:08,644 --> 01:11:13,232
Quit your basking in the darkness,
and come on up here.

539
01:11:13,315 --> 01:11:15,859
Hitch your bitch.

540
01:11:15,943 --> 01:11:16,819
Grr.

541
01:11:16,902 --> 01:11:19,488
<i>Oh, Lola, baby. Gee.</i>

542
01:11:19,572 --> 01:11:23,742
<i>This hot bitch is gonna
bang gangbang your evil nasty self.</i>

543
01:11:23,826 --> 01:11:26,078
<i>Oh, lust. Oh, hatred...</i>

544
01:11:27,079 --> 01:11:29,623
What's that hearse doing here?

545
01:12:02,281 --> 01:12:04,658
What's with the drive-by?

546
01:12:09,246 --> 01:12:15,044
Nobody move. We're doing this
dead or alive. Keep going, Daddy.

547
01:12:17,671 --> 01:12:20,257
- Cara Mia!
- Just shoot to the end, Nino.

548
01:12:31,352 --> 01:12:34,605
Come on. Get up. Get up. Get up.

549
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:37,232
<i>Come on, Levantate.</i>

550
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:46,116
Aah!

551
01:12:46,533 --> 01:12:48,911
So you're not invincible.

552
01:13:02,508 --> 01:13:06,887
We're kicking our homey down.
Our hardcore banger Luc G here.

553
01:13:06,929 --> 01:13:11,809
And, uh... To have and to hold
your immortal badassitude.

554
01:13:13,435 --> 01:13:15,646
Killer. Killer.

555
01:13:19,358 --> 01:13:23,779
And, uh... He'll be your homey.
Now, and for evermore.

556
01:13:49,888 --> 01:13:52,266
Bye-bye, birdie.

557
01:13:57,479 --> 01:14:00,023
This is some serious shit.

558
01:14:02,109 --> 01:14:04,111
It's not time yet.

559
01:14:04,194 --> 01:14:06,905
Hurry up.
Make me the fucking antichrist.

560
01:14:15,873 --> 01:14:18,458
- Shoot him. Shoot him.
- No, don't.

561
01:14:28,051 --> 01:14:30,178
You need to keep better track
of your ammo.

562
01:14:30,262 --> 01:14:32,681
It's been a long night.

563
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:38,353
Uh... Do we all take him, or vice versa?

564
01:14:38,437 --> 01:14:41,356
I do.

565
01:14:41,398 --> 01:14:47,029
Nice timing, Tonto.
I now pronounce you devil and his shorty.

566
01:14:47,654 --> 01:14:52,117
- I love you, Lucifer.
- Well. kiss the bride, motherfucker.

567
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:55,120
Kiss the bride.

568
01:15:02,628 --> 01:15:07,049
<i>- Will you marry me, Lola Byrne?
- Till death do us part, Luc Crash.</i>

569
01:15:24,274 --> 01:15:26,693
- Shoot him. Shoot him.
- No. No, don't.

570
01:15:26,777 --> 01:15:31,073
- Shoot him.
- He's the crow. Look, I've seen his magic.

571
01:15:33,617 --> 01:15:36,078
I'll blow us both to hell.

572
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:39,623
- Good idea.
- I know your soft spot, Injun lover.

573
01:15:39,664 --> 01:15:42,959
Shoot him. Shoot him.
He's no crow, he's a killer. Shoot him.

574
01:15:43,418 --> 01:15:44,795
God. This isn't right.

575
01:15:44,878 --> 01:15:47,214
"War doesn't determine who's right.
just who's left."

576
01:15:47,297 --> 01:15:52,344
Better to die a hero at night
than to wake a coward in the morning.

577
01:15:53,053 --> 01:15:56,890
I can't believe
you really did that, shorty.

578
01:15:56,973 --> 01:16:00,310
Look at that. Nice try.

579
01:16:00,352 --> 01:16:04,356
It looks like we're gonna have to get
another dumb fuck to tie the knot, huh?

580
01:16:04,773 --> 01:16:09,986
Incoming on an ass-kicking,
night-riding, suicide machine.

581
01:16:51,069 --> 01:16:52,654
Honey...

582
01:16:54,739 --> 01:16:57,701
I'm home.

583
01:16:57,742 --> 01:16:59,077
Luc.

584
01:16:59,244 --> 01:17:00,871
Luc?

585
01:17:00,912 --> 01:17:04,374
<i>Call me Lucifer.</i>

586
01:17:05,959 --> 01:17:09,379
Someone owes me two lifetimes.

587
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:11,798
And a set of perfect blue eyes.

588
01:17:11,882 --> 01:17:16,052
Jimmy Crow.
Let's get this party started, shall we?

589
01:17:16,094 --> 01:17:20,015
By taking out my vengeance on God

590
01:17:20,098 --> 01:17:22,225
and all his angels.

591
01:17:22,309 --> 01:17:24,436
One nail at a time.

592
01:17:40,619 --> 01:17:44,039
Do you really wanna fucking dance?

593
01:17:47,667 --> 01:17:50,086
Come on here, tiger.

594
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:52,672
Feeding time.

595
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:22,577
I need sex baby, and fast.

596
01:18:22,661 --> 01:18:25,538
If we don't do it before sunrise.

597
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:30,335
The spell breaks, and you'll be
digging a hole straight to hell.

598
01:18:30,377 --> 01:18:35,799
Are you hearing me? On sacred ground
is where these eyes get their power.

599
01:18:35,882 --> 01:18:37,842
It's all good, baby.

600
01:18:37,926 --> 01:18:43,014
I'm already way deep
in that sacred burial ground of yours.

601
01:18:43,098 --> 01:18:45,350
Dig?

602
01:18:45,392 --> 01:18:47,685
Is it really you?

603
01:18:47,769 --> 01:18:50,188
Original gangster?

604
01:18:50,271 --> 01:18:54,192
Well, wicked-ass props to you, Mr. OG.

605
01:18:54,275 --> 01:18:56,778
And thanks for representing
all the homeboys.

606
01:18:56,861 --> 01:18:58,279
Yeah.

607
01:19:04,494 --> 01:19:08,331
You still do tricks, right, shorty?

608
01:19:08,415 --> 01:19:12,293
You wanted revenge,
and a deal with the devil.

609
01:19:13,503 --> 01:19:16,339
Take your vengeance, baby.

610
01:19:21,761 --> 01:19:27,058
You're gonna really
enjoy it soon, and learn how to fake it.

611
01:19:27,642 --> 01:19:29,602
<i>Kiss the book.</i>

612
01:19:29,644 --> 01:19:32,939
<i>A little cherry for your cherry.</i>

613
01:19:36,067 --> 01:19:37,610
No. No.

614
01:19:37,694 --> 01:19:41,156
I mean, you promised me. No.

615
01:19:41,614 --> 01:19:44,659
<i>No! Wait! Aah!</i>

616
01:19:45,118 --> 01:19:48,580
Let us pray.
Dear Heavenly Father...

617
01:19:49,164 --> 01:19:50,665
Freeze!

618
01:19:50,915 --> 01:19:52,375
Freeze!

619
01:19:56,129 --> 01:20:01,593
See this knife? This is the one
I used to carve out your daughter's eyes.

620
01:20:02,135 --> 01:20:04,345
Sorry, folks.

621
01:20:04,429 --> 01:20:09,934
I'd slice all your throats,
but I gotta get to the burial grounds.

622
01:20:10,018 --> 01:20:11,978
<i>Au revoir.</i>

623
01:20:18,192 --> 01:20:21,195
She's itching for a climax.

624
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:31,456
So I did what you wanted.

625
01:20:31,539 --> 01:20:36,210
Now it's time for you
to ring my bell and lock the spell.

626
01:20:36,252 --> 01:20:42,508
And we're talking, what? Seven days,
seven nights until you have to go back.

627
01:20:42,592 --> 01:20:46,262
Seven days?
You're thinking way too small, princess.

628
01:20:47,138 --> 01:20:52,310
You're in for a seven-year itch
you won't ever want to scratch. Ah!

629
01:20:52,393 --> 01:20:53,645
You want to see the Middle East, huh?

630
01:20:53,728 --> 01:20:56,564
It won't just be the Sahara Desert
that's burning hot.

631
01:20:56,606 --> 01:20:59,525
Pick any city, Paris?

632
01:21:02,695 --> 01:21:04,822
Rio? Carnival.

633
01:21:04,906 --> 01:21:07,450
Beijing?

634
01:21:07,533 --> 01:21:12,455
We'll stroll in, set a little spark
like your little fucking mine and casino.

635
01:21:12,497 --> 01:21:17,168
And just watch 'em all
cut each other to fucking pieces.

636
01:21:17,251 --> 01:21:19,921
You see, the world's like an angry dog
on a choke chain, you know?

637
01:21:19,962 --> 01:21:22,382
It lunges. snaps and pulls.

638
01:21:22,465 --> 01:21:25,760
But the chain around its neck
just gets tighter and tighter.

639
01:21:27,345 --> 01:21:31,808
It don't know that all it has to do
to be free is let go.

640
01:21:31,849 --> 01:21:33,434
Huh.

641
01:21:35,978 --> 01:21:38,690
<i>Oh. Don't fret, Freulein.</i>

642
01:21:38,773 --> 01:21:42,944
The apocalypse is gonna be
one hell of a honeymoon.

643
01:21:43,027 --> 01:21:46,739
'Cause in the morning we're gonna
massacre that Indian tribe for you.

644
01:21:46,823 --> 01:21:49,951
And then move on
to bigger and badder things.

645
01:22:25,027 --> 01:22:27,947
Take him down.
Take down the crow.

646
01:23:01,981 --> 01:23:04,233
Is he dead?

647
01:23:04,317 --> 01:23:06,652
<i>Or alive?</i>

648
01:23:06,694 --> 01:23:09,030
Holy Jesus!

649
01:23:15,369 --> 01:23:17,705
You're in my way.

650
01:23:57,745 --> 01:24:00,247
She believed in you.

651
01:24:01,958 --> 01:24:04,627
She believed in all of you.

652
01:24:05,211 --> 01:24:08,005
She believed in fairy tales.

653
01:24:08,089 --> 01:24:10,675
Who are you to tell me
what she believed in?

654
01:24:10,758 --> 01:24:16,722
I'm the fairy fucking godfather
that's gonna save your fairy fucking tails.

655
01:24:18,432 --> 01:24:24,146
- He's bleeding to death.
- Help him. Help the crow.

656
01:24:27,316 --> 01:24:29,694
How could God pick such a man?

657
01:24:33,989 --> 01:24:36,158
Why not?

658
01:24:36,242 --> 01:24:38,244
She did.

659
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:04,103
Lily believed in the old stories.

660
01:25:04,186 --> 01:25:06,647
Like the Crow Dance.

661
01:25:06,689 --> 01:25:08,983
They'll think I was a fool.

662
01:25:09,066 --> 01:25:11,777
They already do.

663
01:25:11,861 --> 01:25:14,321
Show 'em how fools dance.

664
01:26:00,493 --> 01:26:06,248
It's your wedding night, little girl.
And Poppy's a horny little devil.

665
01:26:13,422 --> 01:26:16,467
Look at my eyes.
Look at my eyes.

666
01:26:19,887 --> 01:26:23,599
The book says
you have to look at my eyes.

667
01:26:23,807 --> 01:26:27,019
The book says
you have to look at my eyes.

668
01:26:29,855 --> 01:26:32,107
Oh.

669
01:26:32,149 --> 01:26:34,193
So close.

670
01:26:34,985 --> 01:26:38,864
The dark prince
was almost crowned, baby.

671
01:26:39,406 --> 01:26:42,117
You can't stop. If the sun comes up
and the spell's undone.

672
01:26:42,201 --> 01:26:47,873
You're just gonna be a worthless punk, and
I'll just be a piece of white trash, Luc.

673
01:26:47,957 --> 01:26:49,625
Luc!

674
01:26:50,834 --> 01:26:54,797
Oh, come on.
Don't you have any respect for the dead?

675
01:26:54,838 --> 01:26:57,174
You know what, kid?

676
01:27:04,181 --> 01:27:07,142
You're really pissing me off.

677
01:27:17,027 --> 01:27:19,530
Minor angel wants to play.

678
01:27:20,489 --> 01:27:23,534
Homeboy's going down
in the majors tonight.

679
01:27:26,370 --> 01:27:31,125
So God gave trash like you wings.

680
01:27:32,084 --> 01:27:35,462
He never gave me shit.
Fucker.

681
01:27:35,546 --> 01:27:38,507
Always just took it all away.

682
01:27:52,688 --> 01:27:54,732
Come on, I need a spell.

683
01:28:00,362 --> 01:28:02,906
No, no, but... Damn. Come on.

684
01:28:02,948 --> 01:28:05,743
Please let me find a spell for this.

685
01:28:15,294 --> 01:28:18,505
If you want to escape from here.
you've got to let it all go.

686
01:28:18,589 --> 01:28:19,590
I can't.

687
01:28:33,979 --> 01:28:37,441
You think your bitch's mojo
can save you? Huh?

688
01:28:38,150 --> 01:28:41,320
You're a hiccup, man.
A fart in my gas pump.

689
01:28:52,623 --> 01:28:54,958
Goddamn, they're dry-clean.

690
01:29:03,050 --> 01:29:04,885
It's alive.

691
01:29:26,365 --> 01:29:30,369
"Quoth the Raven. 'Nevermore'."
motherfucker!

692
01:29:32,913 --> 01:29:36,708
You think you're doing God's work.
sunshine?

693
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:40,087
Killers don't go to heaven, dog.
They go down.

694
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:42,339
Like my fucking bitch.

695
01:29:46,927 --> 01:29:49,263
Yeah. There we go. Yeah?

696
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:04,236
Get the fuck back up!

697
01:30:14,288 --> 01:30:16,248
Look at me.

698
01:30:18,166 --> 01:30:19,960
I'm gonna let it all go.

699
01:30:26,425 --> 01:30:28,427
Oh, fuck.

700
01:30:50,073 --> 01:30:53,285
Hail Mary, full of grace.

701
01:30:53,368 --> 01:30:55,287
The Lord is with thee.

702
01:30:55,370 --> 01:30:57,914
You hear that? Huh?

703
01:30:57,998 --> 01:31:01,460
The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
are riding, man.

704
01:31:01,543 --> 01:31:03,545
Blessed art thou amongst women.

705
01:31:03,628 --> 01:31:05,464
Famine.

706
01:31:06,214 --> 01:31:07,215
Check.

707
01:31:07,299 --> 01:31:09,134
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

708
01:31:09,551 --> 01:31:11,219
Pestilence.

709
01:31:13,180 --> 01:31:14,264
Check.

710
01:31:14,347 --> 01:31:16,433
Holy Mary, mother of God...

711
01:31:16,892 --> 01:31:18,351
War.

712
01:31:19,728 --> 01:31:20,896
Check.

713
01:31:20,979 --> 01:31:23,231
Pray for us sinners...

714
01:31:24,232 --> 01:31:24,816
Death.

715
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:26,651
You bastard!

716
01:31:29,446 --> 01:31:32,032
- Check, please.
- now, and at the hour of our death.

717
01:31:32,115 --> 01:31:34,534
- I'm picking up the tab.
- Amen.

718
01:31:35,619 --> 01:31:39,164
Because I'm the only
fucking friend you got.

719
01:31:52,969 --> 01:31:55,680
Oh, say... Say, kid...

720
01:31:56,681 --> 01:32:00,727
Do you know what
an angel without mercy is? Huh?

721
01:32:01,811 --> 01:32:03,813
It's nothing but a devil.

722
01:32:08,026 --> 01:32:11,488
How about a little
sympathy for the devil, huh?

723
01:32:11,530 --> 01:32:13,490
"I saw a creature."

724
01:32:13,573 --> 01:32:19,412
"He sat, and he held his own heart
in his hands, and he ate of it."

725
01:32:20,330 --> 01:32:23,500
"I asked him. 'Is it good. friend?"'

726
01:32:23,542 --> 01:32:26,670
"He said. 'It is bitter."'

727
01:32:27,170 --> 01:32:29,214
"'Bitter."'

728
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:37,514
- "'But I like it because it is bitter." '
- May God's fury rain down on you.

729
01:32:37,556 --> 01:32:42,686
"'And because it is my heart."'

730
01:33:01,329 --> 01:33:03,790
You have the right to remain silent.

731
01:33:03,873 --> 01:33:09,421
And anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

732
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:12,424
You have the right to an attorney.
If you don't have one...
