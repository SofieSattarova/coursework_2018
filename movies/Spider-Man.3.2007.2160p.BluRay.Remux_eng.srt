1
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:21,023
It's me, Peter Parker.
Your friendly neighborhood...

2
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:22,202
...you know.

3
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:25,372
I've come a long way from being
the boy who was bit by a spider.

4
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:28,406
Back then, nothing seemed
to go right for me. Now...

5
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:29,974
Wow, look, it's Spider-Man!

6
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:31,769
- Super cool!
- Spider-man!

7
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:33,947
...people really like me.

8
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:36,878
Stick around. It's gonna start again
in a couple minutes.

9
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:39,644
That's okay.

10
00:03:40,855 --> 00:03:42,550
The city is safe and sound.

11
00:03:42,757 --> 00:03:44,691
I guess I've had something
to do with that.

12
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,655
My Uncle Ben would be proud.

13
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,591
I still get to school. Top of my class.

14
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:56,633
Now, the Hamiltonian shows us...

15
00:03:56,837 --> 00:04:01,069
...that the energy levels
are perturbed by the electric field.

16
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:08,013
From the form of this matrix,
we can see?

17
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,183
Miss Stacy?

18
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:13,615
That only the "m equals zero
quantum states" are affected.

19
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:16,881
Correct. Good work, Miss Stacy.

20
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:24,261
Parker? You got something to add?

21
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,760
No, sir.

22
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:33,299
And I'm in love
with the girl of my dreams.

23
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:50,189
Hi.

24
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:54,794
Miss Watson left a ticket for me.
Peter Parker.

25
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,320
Excuse me. Sorry.

26
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,931
Thank you. Sorry.

27
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:08,302
I'm so nervous.

28
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,430
That's my girlfriend.

29
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:51,035
- I thought she was good.
- Yeah.

30
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:53,739
Harry?

31
00:06:53,948 --> 00:06:55,347
Harry!

32
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:57,540
I need to talk to you.

33
00:06:58,185 --> 00:06:59,914
Explain things.

34
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:05,550
Tell it to my father.
Raise him from the dead.

35
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:11,092
I'm your friend, Harry.
I cared about your father.

36
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,229
M. J!

37
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:23,706
- Peter!
- Congrats!

38
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:26,141
- Was I good?
- Good? You were great.

39
00:07:26,347 --> 00:07:28,645
- You were...
- You said great.

40
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:32,341
I love my flowers, they're beautiful.
And those are from Harry.

41
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:36,455
- Was he here tonight?
- Yeah, I ran into him outside.

42
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:39,751
- What's with you guys anyway?
- It's complicated.

43
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,951
Tell me again. Was I really good?

44
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,494
I was so nervous.
My knees were shaking.

45
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:47,166
- Your knees were fine.
- The applause wasn't very loud.

46
00:07:47,368 --> 00:07:49,268
Yes, it was. Well, it's the acoustics.

47
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,598
It's all about diffusion. It keeps
the sound waves from grouping.

48
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,604
When the sound waves,
they propagate, then it's like an...

49
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,777
You are such a nerd.

50
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:52,529
Did you see that one?

51
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,470
You know what?

52
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,503
I'd like to sing on-stage
for the rest of my life...

53
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,081
...with you in the first row.

54
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,250
I'll be there.

55
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:18,450
Tell me you love me.

56
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,595
I love you.

57
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,291
I love you so much.

58
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,124
I always have.

59
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:17,316
- Ready?
- Yep.

60
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,264
You can't hide here, Flint.

61
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:19,832
- I'm just here to see my daughter.
- You are an escaped convict.

62
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,771
The cops are looking for you.
You're not getting near her.

63
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:27,441
You're nothing but a common thief.

64
00:12:27,648 --> 00:12:31,106
- You maybe even killed a man?
- It wasn't like that.

65
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,646
It wasn't.

66
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,981
I had good reason
for what I was doing.

67
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:37,383
And that's the truth.

68
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:41,755
You and the truth, sitting in prison,
having three meals a day together.

69
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:44,487
I live in the presence of great truth...

70
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:46,996
...and that is the truth
that you left behind...

71
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,964
...right there in that bedroom.

72
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:04,878
Penny.

73
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,513
I missed you.

74
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:11,246
I miss you too, Daddy.

75
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:25,761
I promise I'll make you healthy again.

76
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,873
Whatever it takes, I'll get the money.

77
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:32,136
You get out of here. Now.

78
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,423
I'm not a bad person.

79
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,352
Just had bad luck.

80
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:08,874
Peter, what is it?

81
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,478
It's M.J.

82
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,811
- I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
- Oh, Peter.

83
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:23,558
The day your Uncle Ben asked me
to marry him, we were so scared.

84
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:25,561
And excited.

85
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:27,529
And very young.

86
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:30,601
And I loved him so fiercely.

87
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:32,829
- And you said yes, right?
- No.

88
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,405
I wanted to say yes, but I said no.

89
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:38,305
I wasn't ready. Neither was he.

90
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:40,776
So we took our time.

91
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:43,347
Looked forward to it.

92
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,111
Didn't want to run into something
with nothing to count on but love.

93
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:51,352
A man has to be understanding...

94
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:54,584
...and put his wife before himself.

95
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,895
Can you do that, Peter?

96
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,296
Yeah, I think I can.

97
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:05,801
Then you have my blessing.

98
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:10,966
I hope you've considered
a proper proposal.

99
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:14,511
Your uncle had it all planned.

100
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,614
He took me to the beach
one Sunday.

101
00:15:16,817 --> 00:15:19,581
Oh, he was a knockout
in his bathing suit.

102
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:22,254
And I didn't look too bad myself.

103
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:24,424
We were very good swimmers.

104
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:27,115
And it was a beautiful day
and he said:

105
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:29,227
"Let's swim to the island."

106
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:34,799
And at the island, we found
a perfect spot by an old tree...

107
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:38,493
...and we lay down
and looked up at the sky.

108
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:41,936
And then he said,
"Close your eyes, May."

109
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:44,872
And I did.
And then he said, "Open them."

110
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:46,841
And I did.

111
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:49,914
And he was holding this ring.

112
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,717
Dazzling...

113
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,614
...in front of me.

114
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,390
I thought it was the sun.

115
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,626
We'd be married 50 years...

116
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:08,396
...come August if...

117
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,406
So...

118
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:23,414
...I hope you'll make it very special
for Mary Jane.

119
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,286
Do something she'll never forget.

120
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,882
Give her this.

121
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,288
Go on. Take it.

122
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,940
- Harry.
- You knew this was coming, Pete.

123
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,170
Listen to me. I didn't kill your father.

124
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,984
He was trying to kill me.
He killed himself.

125
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:07,915
Shut up!

126
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:52,288
I'm still here, Peter.

127
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,380
Hate those things.

128
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,543
Harry?

129
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:23,948
Harry.

130
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:26,508
Harry.

131
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:33,291
Oh, my God.

132
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:41,464
Harry!

133
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,234
Come on!

134
00:21:47,941 --> 00:21:49,568
God.

135
00:21:53,213 --> 00:21:54,441
- Defib.
- Two hundred.

136
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,376
And clear.

137
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:57,777
No response.

138
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,713
- Recharge, let's go again.
- Go ahead.

139
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,319
- Charging.
- And clear.

140
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:03,489
No response.

141
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,853
Let's recharge and do it
one more time. And clear.

142
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,055
Captain Stacy.

143
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:16,129
- What's this?
- Flint Marko.

144
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:18,395
The guy we tied
to the Ben Parker homicide.

145
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:20,402
- What about him?
- Broke out of Rikers.

146
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:21,904
- And?
- He's on the run.

147
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:24,235
He's in the marshlands.
I think we got him.

148
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:30,175
There he is.

149
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:51,802
You two, take the west side.
Tommy, take the east.

150
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:57,836
Where did he go?

151
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:21,627
- Capacitors charged.
- Right.

152
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:23,825
Donnie, we got a little fluctuation
on one.

153
00:23:24,037 --> 00:23:27,700
- There's a change in the silicon mass.
- It's probably a bird. It'll fly away.

154
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,636
Initiating demolecularization.

155
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,656
- How is he?
- He's gonna be okay.

156
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:04,234
But there's been
some memory impairment.

157
00:25:04,437 --> 00:25:06,064
Particularly his short-term memory.

158
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:08,297
Right now he can't
remember the accident...

159
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:10,567
...or anything that happened
to him recently.

160
00:25:10,777 --> 00:25:12,005
Is it permanent?

161
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:15,203
It could be. Only time will tell.

162
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:17,809
He's awake if you wanna see him.

163
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,245
Maybe I should wait.

164
00:25:19,452 --> 00:25:22,751
No, it's fine. Just keep it brief.
I want him to rest.

165
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:43,203
Hey, buddy.

166
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,309
Hey.

167
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,569
Hit my head.

168
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,247
Yeah.

169
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:51,779
Doctor said I was in an accident.

170
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:53,042
Hit-and-run.

171
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:56,277
I don't remember much of anything.

172
00:25:57,857 --> 00:25:59,484
My father...

173
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:01,559
...he died, right?

174
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,296
This is all so weird.

175
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,058
Hi. I got here as fast as I could.

176
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,237
I know that face.

177
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:13,932
How you doing?

178
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,607
I don't know.

179
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:17,833
Last thing I remember, I was fine.

180
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:19,136
Somewhere.

181
00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:21,107
You're still fine.

182
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:24,512
We love you, Harry.

183
00:26:25,218 --> 00:26:27,152
It feels like...

184
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:31,455
...somehow I've been gone
for a really long time.

185
00:26:33,126 --> 00:26:34,753
And now I'm back home.

186
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:37,588
It's good to have you back.

187
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:41,692
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to ask
you guys to scoot, okay?

188
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:44,165
- Okay.
- All right. Thank you.

189
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,304
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

190
00:26:46,506 --> 00:26:48,497
Yeah. Great.

191
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:50,832
Get some sleep.

192
00:26:54,347 --> 00:26:56,815
- I think he's gonna be fine.
- I think so.

193
00:26:57,016 --> 00:26:59,610
- And you guys seem great.
- Yeah.

194
00:27:02,822 --> 00:27:04,380
You have lovely friends.

195
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,649
My best friends.

196
00:27:09,362 --> 00:27:11,489
I'd give my life for them.

197
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,417
- Yeah?
- It's me.

198
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,689
Hey.

199
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:28,219
Peter, you know I can't open the door.

200
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:29,826
It's stuck again?

201
00:30:30,363 --> 00:30:32,422
Just come on and help me.

202
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:34,155
I'm coming.

203
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:42,533
- Hey.
- The review.

204
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:46,402
- They hated it. They hated me.
- Well, they can't hate you.

205
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:48,842
"The young Miss Watson
is a pretty girl...

206
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:51,141
...easy on the eyes,
but not on the ears.

207
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,614
Her small voice didn't carry
past the first row."

208
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:55,844
That's ridiculous, I was right there.

209
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:57,579
You were in the first row.

210
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,123
Yeah, this... Listen, you were great.

211
00:31:01,594 --> 00:31:05,690
That's a critic. This is something
you're gonna have to get used to.

212
00:31:05,898 --> 00:31:09,356
Believe me, I know.
Spider-Man gets attacked all the time.

213
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:13,527
This isn't about you. This is about me.
It's about my career.

214
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:17,175
I know, and I'm just saying
you can't let it bring you down.

215
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:20,106
You gotta believe in yourself
and pull yourself together.

216
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:21,939
You get right back
on the horse and...

217
00:31:22,148 --> 00:31:23,945
Don't give me the horse thing.

218
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,550
Try and understand how I feel.

219
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:33,184
It's just...

220
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:38,288
...I look at these words...

221
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:41,596
...and it's like my father wrote them.

222
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:46,865
All cars. All cars in the vicinity of
54th and Sixth Avenue, please report.

223
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,700
Crane out of control,
approach with caution.

224
00:31:52,978 --> 00:31:54,673
"Go get them, tiger"?

225
00:31:56,982 --> 00:31:58,540
I'm sorry.

226
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:34,049
Oh, my God. 7-Adam to Central.

227
00:32:34,253 --> 00:32:37,051
That crane job you sent us on?
It's bigger than we thought.

228
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:40,521
We're gonna need
a major mobilization right away.

229
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:50,330
Shut it down at the generator. Now!

230
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:57,071
Okay, Gwen, I've got a secret:
It's my copier.

231
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:03,042
What is that thing
doing in my background?

232
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:31,503
They got some kind of short.
Can't shut down the crane.

233
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,508
Get Edison on the phone.
Kill the power to the whole block.

234
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,239
Are you all right?

235
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:41,043
It's coming back.

236
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:44,179
Oh, no.

237
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:10,914
- Oh, my God. That's Gwen.
- What?

238
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:17,452
What's she doing up there?

239
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:20,420
I just saw her last night.
She said she had a modeling gig.

240
00:34:20,626 --> 00:34:23,561
- Who are you?
- It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

241
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:25,491
And I work at the Daily Bugle.

242
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:28,596
And I'm dating your daughter.

243
00:35:24,023 --> 00:35:25,320
You okay?

244
00:35:25,524 --> 00:35:27,890
Yeah, I'm fine.

245
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:29,082
Thank you.

246
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,626
Hey, Spidey, hold on.
Bugle needs a photo.

247
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,627
- Thank God you're okay.
- Daddy.

248
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:35,732
Hey. I'm the new guy.

249
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:36,958
New guy?

250
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:39,671
You okay?

251
00:35:39,872 --> 00:35:42,739
From now on, I am gonna be
taking shots of you for the Bugle.

252
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:45,739
So smile. Are you smiling?
Just kidding.

253
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:48,435
- They got a guy.
- Who, Parker?

254
00:35:48,881 --> 00:35:53,011
Yeah, look, just between you and me,
guy's kind of an amateur.

255
00:35:53,218 --> 00:35:55,880
Have you noticed his stuff
makes you look a little bloated?

256
00:35:56,088 --> 00:35:58,352
Just... Yeah, a little chunky.

257
00:35:58,791 --> 00:36:00,349
Okay.

258
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,494
But you don't have to worry about that
anymore, buddy.

259
00:36:12,438 --> 00:36:13,427
Dazzle me.

260
00:36:21,113 --> 00:36:23,946
Just something the boys in
the Ad Department and I whipped up.

261
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:27,016
As you know, circulation at the Bugle's
been pretty good.

262
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:29,084
Though not as good
as The New York Times.

263
00:36:29,288 --> 00:36:31,984
Or the Daily News, or the Post,
or several other smaller...

264
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:34,159
Get on with it, you moron...!

265
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,293
- What?
- Your blood pressure, Mr. Jameson.

266
00:36:36,495 --> 00:36:39,692
- Your wife told you to watch the anger.
- You tell my wife...

267
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:45,098
Thank you.

268
00:36:46,939 --> 00:36:49,931
So I propose this campaign.

269
00:36:50,142 --> 00:36:52,576
"Daily Bugle." That's obvious.

270
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:55,872
"It's hip, it's now."
I came up with that one.

271
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:59,477
"It's wow." That's actually Erickson.
He goes crazy.

272
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:01,915
We gave him a couple lattes,
it's like:

273
00:37:02,254 --> 00:37:05,121
"And how." That's me again.

274
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:07,420
Time to take your pill.

275
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:10,321
Not that one.

276
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:12,757
Not that one.

277
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:23,305
Drink plenty of water.

278
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:28,645
Thank you.

279
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:32,016
Continue.

280
00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:38,182
- He's busy.
- I'm just here to talk to you, beautiful.

281
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,914
What's that smell?

282
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:43,390
That's a little something called
Nice and Easy. What's on you?

283
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,153
It's called Go Away.

284
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:47,298
That is the dumbest idea
you've ever had...

285
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:50,366
...and you have had some doozies.
- Blood pressure.

286
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,532
Hey, where are you going?

287
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:56,733
- Who are you?
- You hired him last week. Freelance.

288
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:59,808
- I did? What's that smell?
- It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

289
00:38:00,012 --> 00:38:03,311
Can I just say I really like that shirt?
It's the crane accident.

290
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:05,346
- Check out the light.
- He likes my shirt.

291
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:06,643
- Hey, Betty.
- Hey, Pete.

292
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:08,547
You better get in there. New guy.

293
00:38:08,754 --> 00:38:11,587
He's trying to sell
some Spidey photos.

294
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:14,648
Thanks.

295
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,795
Parker. You're late, maybe too late.
Bruckner beat you to it.

296
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:19,554
It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

297
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:22,063
- But I got you this.
- But he got me this.

298
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:24,599
I didn't see you there.
How'd you get that high?

299
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:27,601
- Climbed. Nearly fell off a flagpole.
- A flagpole?

300
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:30,639
- Which one do we use?
- I like Bernstein's.

301
00:38:30,843 --> 00:38:32,037
- It's better.
- Cheaper too.

302
00:38:32,244 --> 00:38:34,906
Congratulations, we'll use yours.
I'll pay you 50 bucks.

303
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:36,512
All right, J.J., I'm your man.

304
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:39,377
I know more about a good picture
than any photographer.

305
00:38:39,585 --> 00:38:43,282
See, photography, it's not just about,
no offense, flagpoles or whatever.

306
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:45,683
It's about lighting.
Composition. Drama.

307
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:47,990
I want a staff job, sir.

308
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:51,321
I have a girl that I intend to marry...

309
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:54,397
...and I guess, I don't know,
I have this stupid little dream...

310
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,036
...of working with one of the greatest
newspaper editors of our time.

311
00:38:58,704 --> 00:39:00,001
J. Jonah Jameson.

312
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:06,205
Well, we do have an opening.
Johnson quit, remember?

313
00:39:06,411 --> 00:39:07,537
- You fired him.
- Whatever.

314
00:39:07,746 --> 00:39:10,647
I know what makes a good picture
and I've been here a long time.

315
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,908
If there's a staff job,
I think I deserve it.

316
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:16,849
He's right, Jonah. Peter's been with us
for years. He's done a great job.

317
00:39:17,055 --> 00:39:18,989
You want a staff job,
you want a staff job.

318
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:20,988
- Anybody care about what I want?
- I do.

319
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:22,956
Shut up. Get out.

320
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:26,562
I want the public to see Spider-Man
for the two-bit criminal he really is.

321
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:30,929
He's a fake, he's full of stickum.
Catch him in the act.

322
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:33,400
Spider-Man with his hand
in a cookie jar.

323
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:35,539
Whoever brings me that photo
gets a job.

324
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:37,606
What're you waiting for,
Chinese New Year?

325
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:39,208
I'm on it, boss.

326
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:41,940
You'll never get that shot.

327
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:43,478
Oh, we'll see.

328
00:39:57,996 --> 00:40:02,990
You know, I guess one person
can make a difference.

329
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,298
Enough said.

330
00:40:11,543 --> 00:40:14,011
Welcome home, Harry.

331
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:18,145
- Thank God you're all right.
- Thanks, Bernard.

332
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,511
- Bernard.
- Sir.

333
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:25,012
Got you a little homecoming present.

334
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:27,785
- It's your old ball.
- Yeah.

335
00:40:27,993 --> 00:40:29,085
Thanks, buddy.

336
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:32,091
We were pretty good
in the backyard, weren't we?

337
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:35,926
We were terrible.
And we tried out for the varsity team.

338
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:38,125
- For the cheerleaders.
- Right.

339
00:40:38,337 --> 00:40:40,862
- Hey, do I have any girlfriends?
- I don't know.

340
00:40:41,073 --> 00:40:42,199
You don't?

341
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,368
Hey, Bernard.
Do I have any girlfriends?

342
00:40:45,577 --> 00:40:48,045
Not that I know of, sir.

343
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:55,177
It's a pretty cool pad, huh?

344
00:40:55,387 --> 00:40:57,048
It's okay.

345
00:40:57,255 --> 00:41:00,156
- Looks like I'm not hurting for money.
- No.

346
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:04,125
Well, maybe I can turn this
no-girlfriend thing around.

347
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:16,538
You know, he always appreciated how
you helped me through high school.

348
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:19,903
Just wish I could remember
more about him.

349
00:41:21,413 --> 00:41:24,871
Well, he loved you.
That's the main thing.

350
00:41:26,018 --> 00:41:30,387
Hey, let's watch a game in the kitchen.
Get something to eat.

351
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:31,715
Okay.

352
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:34,217
Heads up.

353
00:41:37,896 --> 00:41:38,885
Did you see that?

354
00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:41,893
- Still got the moves.
- Yeah.

355
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:16,693
Why are we stopping?

356
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:21,863
What is she doing here?

357
00:42:22,074 --> 00:42:23,939
Well, Gary was supposed
to call her agent.

358
00:42:26,578 --> 00:42:29,206
Hi, honey. We tried to reach you.

359
00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:30,904
I'm sorry.

360
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:32,208
One critic?

361
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:33,577
No, all the papers, dear.

362
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:36,986
Mary Jane, honey, sit down.
Let us explain it to you.

363
00:42:37,189 --> 00:42:39,749
Listen, if you'd like,
we could say you became ill.

364
00:42:50,802 --> 00:42:52,736
That was so poorly handled.

365
00:42:52,938 --> 00:42:54,405
Yeah.

366
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,771
Let's just rehearse.

367
00:43:02,481 --> 00:43:04,779
All right, Spidey.

368
00:43:43,088 --> 00:43:45,056
Spidey! Spidey! Spidey!

369
00:43:45,257 --> 00:43:48,818
Excuse me, miss? Could I please
see that gorgeous smile?

370
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:50,756
Hi, Eddie.

371
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:54,056
You're so beautiful.
This is front-page stuff.

372
00:43:54,266 --> 00:43:55,824
I gotta practice. See you later.

373
00:43:56,034 --> 00:43:57,899
- How about tonight?
- Not tonight.

374
00:43:58,103 --> 00:43:59,502
Why not?

375
00:43:59,704 --> 00:44:03,572
What about that amazing,
amazing night that we had?

376
00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:07,803
We had a coffee, Eddie.

377
00:44:08,013 --> 00:44:09,674
Hey, beautiful.

378
00:44:10,382 --> 00:44:11,815
One more.

379
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,452
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

380
00:44:17,656 --> 00:44:21,752
- You're not still mad at me, are you?
- No, Peter, I'm proud of you.

381
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,019
Hey, I'm gonna be swinging in
from over there.

382
00:44:24,229 --> 00:44:26,288
- Oh, yeah?
- So you know where to look.

383
00:44:27,899 --> 00:44:29,230
Give them a good show.

384
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:31,466
Don't worry about that review.

385
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:35,106
We're gonna be laughing about it
tomorrow night, I promise.

386
00:44:35,307 --> 00:44:36,831
Yeah.

387
00:44:53,525 --> 00:44:56,153
Isn't that that guy
from that prison break?

388
00:44:56,461 --> 00:44:57,860
He fits.

389
00:44:58,063 --> 00:45:00,554
Hey, you. Halt.

390
00:45:01,399 --> 00:45:02,991
Cover the back.

391
00:45:06,571 --> 00:45:08,596
Hon, be careful.

392
00:45:57,188 --> 00:45:58,246
He's in the truck.

393
00:45:58,456 --> 00:46:00,424
Round the front.

394
00:46:13,505 --> 00:46:14,972
Fire.

395
00:46:39,164 --> 00:46:40,654
People of the city of New York...

396
00:46:40,865 --> 00:46:44,323
...I am here today
because I fell 62 stories...

397
00:46:44,536 --> 00:46:46,128
...and someone caught me.

398
00:46:46,338 --> 00:46:49,307
Someone who never asks
for anything in return.

399
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:53,136
Someone who doesn't even want us
to know who he is.

400
00:46:53,345 --> 00:46:54,369
Hey, M.J.

401
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:56,911
- Harry.
- Hey.

402
00:46:57,115 --> 00:46:58,480
Where's Pete?

403
00:46:59,351 --> 00:47:01,410
- Taking somebody's picture, I guess.
- Right.

404
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:04,349
I'm so happy to see you.
You look so good, Harry.

405
00:47:04,556 --> 00:47:05,853
I've never felt better.

406
00:47:06,057 --> 00:47:08,150
It's a weird feeling
not knowing who you are.

407
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,090
Bump on the head,
I'm as free as a bird.

408
00:47:11,363 --> 00:47:13,593
Will you bump me on the head?

409
00:47:15,767 --> 00:47:17,997
Hey, Pete said you're in a play.

410
00:47:18,236 --> 00:47:20,864
You came. You sent me flowers.

411
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:23,540
I did? I'll come again tonight.

412
00:47:24,209 --> 00:47:27,235
You can't. I was let go.

413
00:47:27,445 --> 00:47:29,140
What happened?

414
00:47:30,782 --> 00:47:32,249
I wasn't very good.

415
00:47:33,785 --> 00:47:35,753
You know, this is embarrassing...

416
00:47:35,954 --> 00:47:38,218
...but I once wrote you a play
in high school.

417
00:47:38,423 --> 00:47:40,050
- You wrote me a play?
- Yeah.

418
00:47:40,258 --> 00:47:41,816
Harry, that's the sweetest thing.

419
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:45,189
So I ask you: When you're dropping
without a parachute...

420
00:47:45,397 --> 00:47:48,764
...or your store's being robbed
or your house is on fire...

421
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:51,026
...who is it that breaks your fall...

422
00:47:51,236 --> 00:47:54,865
...puts out the flames
and saves your children?

423
00:47:55,073 --> 00:47:56,700
Spider-Man.

424
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:57,966
They love me.

425
00:47:58,176 --> 00:48:01,475
Then let's hear it
for your one and only...

426
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:06,116
...friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man.

427
00:48:18,196 --> 00:48:21,359
Hey. What's up? All right.
How you doing?

428
00:48:23,034 --> 00:48:24,934
Shazam!

429
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:27,972
Hey, guys.

430
00:48:28,173 --> 00:48:29,765
Spider-Man. Spider-Man.

431
00:48:29,974 --> 00:48:32,135
Hey there. Hi.

432
00:48:33,978 --> 00:48:35,240
- Kiss him.
- Kiss him.

433
00:48:35,447 --> 00:48:38,143
Kiss him. Kiss him. Kiss him.

434
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,740
Go ahead, lay one on me.

435
00:48:40,952 --> 00:48:42,681
- Really?
- Yeah, they'll love it.

436
00:48:42,887 --> 00:48:44,354
- Kiss her.
- Kiss him.

437
00:48:44,556 --> 00:48:45,818
No, Spider-Man, no.

438
00:48:46,024 --> 00:48:47,889
All right.

439
00:48:56,634 --> 00:48:59,330
Hope Pete's getting a shot of this.

440
00:49:04,843 --> 00:49:06,743
Hey, hey, are you okay?

441
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:08,276
Yeah, I'm fine.

442
00:49:54,259 --> 00:49:56,250
Hey, man,
we got something on the roof.

443
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:20,076
Jig's up, pal.

444
00:50:20,952 --> 00:50:23,716
I don't wanna hurt you. Leave now.

445
00:50:23,922 --> 00:50:27,119
I guess you haven't heard.
I'm the sheriff around these parts.

446
00:50:27,325 --> 00:50:28,349
Okay.

447
00:51:07,098 --> 00:51:08,531
Help!

448
00:51:43,001 --> 00:51:45,526
Where do all these guys come from?

449
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:40,387
I'm sorry, I don't speak...

450
00:52:40,591 --> 00:52:43,890
But this is a French restaurant, non?

451
00:52:46,931 --> 00:52:49,900
- Name, please?
- Parker, Peter.

452
00:52:53,771 --> 00:52:55,033
Here we are.

453
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:57,400
Table for two. Parker.

454
00:52:58,609 --> 00:53:02,636
- Parker.
- That is what I said: Parker.

455
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:07,015
I have a request.

456
00:53:07,218 --> 00:53:11,621
My girlfriend will be coming
and I have this ring.

457
00:53:16,928 --> 00:53:18,486
Hello.

458
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:21,529
Oh, so you want to
pop the question tonight, huh?

459
00:53:21,733 --> 00:53:24,531
Yes, and I wanna do something
very special.

460
00:53:24,736 --> 00:53:27,170
I love it. Romance.

461
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:28,895
I am French.

462
00:53:30,942 --> 00:53:34,434
When I signal you, if you'd bring some
champagne with the ring...

463
00:53:34,645 --> 00:53:36,943
- In the bottom of her glass?
- Perfect.

464
00:53:38,049 --> 00:53:40,176
Also, I thought at the same time...

465
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:43,911
...if the musicians
would play this song...

466
00:53:45,022 --> 00:53:47,081
Their favorite.

467
00:53:47,492 --> 00:53:49,892
And take good care of the ring.

468
00:53:50,094 --> 00:53:52,585
Oui, with my life, monsieur.

469
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,292
I like you.

470
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:01,938
Thank you.

471
00:54:13,251 --> 00:54:15,412
Okay, so...

472
00:54:15,953 --> 00:54:18,251
Oh, would you like
some champagne?

473
00:54:21,959 --> 00:54:24,018
How'd that get in there?

474
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:27,590
Oh, don't cry.

475
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,761
Hi.

476
00:54:34,906 --> 00:54:36,897
Look at you. Wow, beautiful.

477
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:38,632
Thanks.

478
00:54:42,914 --> 00:54:44,438
This place in your budget?

479
00:54:44,649 --> 00:54:46,810
Oh, well, it's a special occasion.

480
00:54:47,552 --> 00:54:49,042
You're on Broadway.

481
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:52,422
I don't feel like
much of a star tonight.

482
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:55,888
Well, you are a star.
And you've earned it.

483
00:54:56,527 --> 00:54:57,653
Peter...

484
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:01,164
...you have no idea
how I feel right now.

485
00:55:01,365 --> 00:55:04,357
Oh, no, I know exactly how you feel.

486
00:55:04,936 --> 00:55:09,236
Listen, I have been through this.
It happens to me all the time.

487
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,374
I see Spider-Man posters
in the window...

488
00:55:11,576 --> 00:55:13,874
...kids running around
with me on their sweaters...

489
00:55:14,078 --> 00:55:15,705
Big Halloween item.

490
00:55:15,913 --> 00:55:18,711
I don't know, I guess I've become
something of an icon.

491
00:55:18,916 --> 00:55:23,580
Like yesterday, they kept screaming,
"Spider-Man, Spider-Man."

492
00:55:24,455 --> 00:55:27,822
I don't know, you know, I mean,
I'm thinking to myself:

493
00:55:28,025 --> 00:55:31,927
"I'm just a nerdy kid from Queens.
Do I deserve this?"

494
00:55:34,065 --> 00:55:35,327
Hi, Pete.

495
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,767
Hi.

496
00:55:44,709 --> 00:55:47,542
Hi, my parents and I
were just having dinner here.

497
00:55:47,745 --> 00:55:50,407
- Hello. I'm Gwen Stacy.
- Hi.

498
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:53,013
This is Mary Jane Watson.

499
00:55:54,452 --> 00:55:58,388
Oh, it's so nice to finally meet you.
Pete talks about you all the time.

500
00:56:00,491 --> 00:56:04,450
Gwen is my lab partner
in Dr. Connors' class.

501
00:56:04,662 --> 00:56:07,756
Pete's something of a genius.
I'd be completely lost without him.

502
00:56:07,965 --> 00:56:09,865
Which actually reminds me...

503
00:56:10,067 --> 00:56:13,195
...Pete, if you've got a picture
of my kiss with Spider-Man...

504
00:56:13,404 --> 00:56:15,599
...could you bring it to class?

505
00:56:15,806 --> 00:56:19,970
I'd really love it. For my portfolio.

506
00:56:20,177 --> 00:56:23,078
After all,
who gets kissed by Spider-Man, right?

507
00:56:23,814 --> 00:56:25,577
I can't imagine.

508
00:56:26,784 --> 00:56:29,446
Well, it was lovely to meet you.

509
00:56:30,354 --> 00:56:31,912
- Good night.
- Good night.

510
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,100
Oh, she's in my science class.

511
00:56:45,303 --> 00:56:47,168
It's not her best subject.

512
00:56:49,674 --> 00:56:50,732
What?

513
00:56:50,942 --> 00:56:53,172
How come
you never mentioned her?

514
00:56:54,612 --> 00:56:56,978
She's your lab partner?

515
00:56:57,181 --> 00:56:59,274
You saved her life?

516
00:56:59,483 --> 00:57:00,780
She thinks you're a genius...

517
00:57:00,985 --> 00:57:04,318
...and she had her
polished fingernails all over you?

518
00:57:04,522 --> 00:57:05,989
Or didn't you notice?

519
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:10,719
And she gave Spider-Man
the key to the city.

520
00:57:12,029 --> 00:57:13,997
I'll never forget that.

521
00:57:17,702 --> 00:57:19,101
She's just a girl in my class.

522
00:57:19,303 --> 00:57:21,032
Let me ask you something.

523
00:57:21,238 --> 00:57:23,206
When you kissed her...

524
00:57:23,407 --> 00:57:25,773
...who was kissing her?

525
00:57:25,977 --> 00:57:28,639
Spider-Man or Peter?

526
00:57:28,879 --> 00:57:31,746
- What do you mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.

527
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:34,247
That was our kiss.

528
00:57:34,452 --> 00:57:35,942
Why would you do that?

529
00:57:36,921 --> 00:57:39,981
You must have known
how it'd make me feel.

530
00:57:40,524 --> 00:57:43,982
- Do you wanna push me away?
- Push you away?

531
00:57:44,195 --> 00:57:46,720
Why would I wanna push you away?
I love you.

532
00:57:46,931 --> 00:57:50,833
You're my girlfriend.
She's a girl in my class, M.J.

533
00:57:52,336 --> 00:57:54,463
I don't feel well.
I'm sorry, I have to go.

534
00:57:54,672 --> 00:57:55,730
No, w...

535
00:57:57,375 --> 00:58:00,242
- Where are you going?
- Please, don't follow me.

536
00:58:03,547 --> 00:58:05,037
Here we are.

537
00:58:41,552 --> 00:58:44,612
Hi, it's M.J.
Sing your song at the beep.

538
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:47,455
Hello.

539
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:53,857
I wish you'd pick up the phone.
I don't know what's going on or...

540
00:58:54,065 --> 00:58:57,034
I don't know if you
got the messages or what.

541
00:58:57,601 --> 00:58:58,727
But...

542
00:59:00,004 --> 00:59:02,734
...I just wanna talk to you.

543
00:59:03,941 --> 00:59:06,273
Okay, call me. Bye.

544
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:19,188
- Hello?
- Mr. Parker?

545
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:20,482
Yeah?

546
00:59:20,691 --> 00:59:23,125
This is Detective Neil Garrett
from the 32nd Precinct.

547
00:59:23,327 --> 00:59:25,056
I'm calling on behalf
of Captain Stacy.

548
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:27,662
He would like you
to come down to the station.

549
00:59:27,865 --> 00:59:31,301
Originally, we thought that this man,
Dennis Carradine...

550
00:59:31,502 --> 00:59:33,367
...was your husband's killer.

551
00:59:33,771 --> 00:59:35,398
We were wrong.

552
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:36,998
What?

553
00:59:37,208 --> 00:59:39,972
Turns out Mr. Carradine
was only an accomplice.

554
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:42,577
The actual killer is still at large.

555
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,441
What are you talking about?

556
00:59:44,648 --> 00:59:47,048
This is the man
who killed your husband.

557
00:59:52,022 --> 00:59:53,182
His name is Flint Marko.

558
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:56,359
He's a small-time crook
who's been in and out of prison.

559
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:57,959
You got this wrong.

560
00:59:58,162 --> 00:59:59,356
Two days ago he escaped.

561
01:00:00,331 --> 01:00:02,856
Evidently, he confessed his guilt
to a cellmate...

562
01:00:03,067 --> 01:00:06,833
...and we have a couple of witnesses
who will corroborate the story.

563
01:00:19,049 --> 01:00:21,540
No, wait, son.
You don't wanna do this.

564
01:00:24,889 --> 01:00:26,117
No!

565
01:00:35,166 --> 01:00:37,828
Hey, get in! What are you doing?

566
01:00:56,687 --> 01:00:58,518
Would you put these photos away,
please?

567
01:00:58,722 --> 01:01:00,952
I'm sorry, Mrs. Parker.
I know this isn't easy...

568
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:03,558
...but, please, be patient with us.

569
01:01:03,761 --> 01:01:05,592
We're doing our job.
We will catch him.

570
01:01:05,796 --> 01:01:07,388
No, you're not doing your job.

571
01:01:07,598 --> 01:01:10,362
I watched my uncle die,
and we chased down the wrong man.

572
01:01:10,568 --> 01:01:13,594
Now you're telling me you had
suspicions for two years? Witnesses?

573
01:01:13,804 --> 01:01:15,931
- Why weren't we told about this?
- Settle down.

574
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:17,835
I have no intention of settling down.

575
01:01:18,042 --> 01:01:20,602
This man killed my uncle,
and he's still out there!

576
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:31,110
L-20 Parkway.

577
01:01:31,322 --> 01:01:33,722
All officers in the vicinity,
please report.

578
01:01:34,124 --> 01:01:35,557
We have an abandoned vehicle...

579
01:01:35,759 --> 01:01:37,989
...and an elderly man
in the middle of the street.

580
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:40,493
Sorry, Wabash Avenue.

581
01:01:43,567 --> 01:01:44,761
Peter, it's M.J.

582
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:48,229
I'm not here about
what happened at dinner.

583
01:01:48,439 --> 01:01:49,633
Just please open up.

584
01:01:57,181 --> 01:01:59,649
Aunt May called me.
She told me about what happened.

585
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:01,442
She's worried about you.

586
01:02:02,253 --> 01:02:03,652
I'm worried about you.

587
01:02:03,854 --> 01:02:05,321
Don't be. I'm fine.

588
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:07,855
I don't want you
to do something stupid.

589
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:10,458
Like try to find my uncle's killer?

590
01:02:10,661 --> 01:02:13,095
And do something you'll regret.

591
01:02:13,297 --> 01:02:16,164
Like with that other guy.

592
01:02:16,867 --> 01:02:20,030
He had a gun on me. I made a move
and he fell. I told you that.

593
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:23,434
- I'm not accusing you of anything.
- 10-22, auto at 556...

594
01:02:23,641 --> 01:02:27,543
- Will you turn that thing off?
- Crossing 5-6 to 5-7.

595
01:02:27,745 --> 01:02:32,546
Yeah, Central, this is Car 3-9
responding to your Sixth Avenue call.

596
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:36,117
Peter, I'm here
because I care about you.

597
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:39,812
And I know that you made a mistake
and that you feel guilty...

598
01:02:40,024 --> 01:02:43,516
...but I wanna be here for you.

599
01:02:43,727 --> 01:02:46,821
Okay. I get it. Thank you.

600
01:02:47,031 --> 01:02:49,625
But I'm fine. L...

601
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:51,630
I don't need your help.

602
01:02:59,076 --> 01:03:01,909
Everybody needs help sometimes,
Peter.

603
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:03,909
Even Spider-Man.

604
01:03:12,189 --> 01:03:14,817
Ninety X-ray, 98.

605
01:03:16,627 --> 01:03:21,291
Two-four King, respond to 1031
at 642 Madison Ave.

606
01:03:21,498 --> 01:03:26,367
One-three Thomas, respond to 1020
at 540 East 107.

607
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:30,404
Male complainant inside apartment.
May be on first floor.

608
01:03:33,844 --> 01:03:37,712
Three Henry 10-11,
I have a residence. 73818...

609
01:04:37,551 --> 01:04:39,246
Don't hurt me.
Just give me a chance!

610
01:04:39,453 --> 01:04:42,354
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance?

611
01:04:42,556 --> 01:04:43,648
Did you?

612
01:04:55,902 --> 01:04:57,699
Where am I?

613
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,581
What is this?

614
01:05:17,891 --> 01:05:19,449
I feel...

615
01:05:24,131 --> 01:05:26,258
This feels good.

616
01:05:38,311 --> 01:05:40,074
Yeah!

617
01:05:56,363 --> 01:05:57,921
This is something else.

618
01:06:00,066 --> 01:06:01,294
What do you think?

619
01:06:01,501 --> 01:06:03,560
I've never seen anything like it.

620
01:06:03,770 --> 01:06:05,567
I'm a physicist, not a biologist...

621
01:06:05,772 --> 01:06:08,434
...but let me look at it in the morning.
Run some tests.

622
01:06:08,642 --> 01:06:09,802
Can we do that now?

623
01:06:14,714 --> 01:06:16,944
It seems to like you.

624
01:06:19,486 --> 01:06:22,046
- Don't let any of that get on you.
- Why not?

625
01:06:22,255 --> 01:06:24,780
It has the characteristics
of a symbiote...

626
01:06:24,991 --> 01:06:28,085
...which needs to bond
to a host to survive.

627
01:06:28,295 --> 01:06:31,822
And sometimes these things in nature,
when they bind...

628
01:06:32,032 --> 01:06:34,432
...they can be hard to unbind.

629
01:06:35,902 --> 01:06:39,633
Bank robbery in progress,
First Eastern Bank at 202 Bismark.

630
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:42,365
Another sandstorm
is reported in the vicinity.

631
01:06:42,576 --> 01:06:45,602
- All cars proceed with caution.
- Marko.

632
01:07:40,534 --> 01:07:42,900
Buddy, love the new outfit.

633
01:07:43,103 --> 01:07:45,094
This is exactly what I need
to scoop Parker.

634
01:07:45,305 --> 01:07:47,034
Give some of that web action.

635
01:07:48,875 --> 01:07:50,934
See you, chump.

636
01:07:52,512 --> 01:07:54,275
What the hell?

637
01:08:36,690 --> 01:08:37,714
Flint Marko.

638
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:43,561
- What do you want from me?
- Remember Ben Parker?

639
01:08:44,364 --> 01:08:47,356
The old man you shot down
in cold blood?

640
01:08:48,835 --> 01:08:50,598
What does it matter to you, anyway?

641
01:08:52,339 --> 01:08:53,738
Everything!

642
01:09:31,478 --> 01:09:33,776
It's time to pay, Marko!

643
01:10:43,783 --> 01:10:45,717
Good riddance.

644
01:11:06,706 --> 01:11:09,300
- Rent.
- Not now.

645
01:11:09,609 --> 01:11:12,271
Listen, it's a free country.
It's not rent-free country.

646
01:11:12,712 --> 01:11:14,612
- Leave me alone.
- Give me rent.

647
01:11:14,814 --> 01:11:17,783
You'll get your rent
when you fix this damn door!

648
01:11:28,962 --> 01:11:30,896
That wasn't cool.

649
01:11:31,264 --> 01:11:35,291
He is a good boy.

650
01:11:37,036 --> 01:11:38,936
He must be in some kind of trouble.

651
01:12:27,086 --> 01:12:30,351
Flint Marko,
the man who killed Uncle Ben...

652
01:12:31,357 --> 01:12:33,723
...he was killed last night.

653
01:12:33,927 --> 01:12:35,394
Oh, my.

654
01:12:36,229 --> 01:12:37,196
What happened?

655
01:12:37,864 --> 01:12:39,297
Spider-Man killed him.

656
01:12:41,234 --> 01:12:42,394
Spider-Man?

657
01:12:43,269 --> 01:12:45,294
I don't understand.

658
01:12:45,505 --> 01:12:48,167
Spider-Man doesn't kill people.

659
01:12:49,776 --> 01:12:51,641
What happened?

660
01:12:54,347 --> 01:12:56,076
I...

661
01:12:56,916 --> 01:12:58,281
He...

662
01:12:58,985 --> 01:13:00,612
He was...

663
01:13:04,791 --> 01:13:07,658
I thought that you'd feel...

664
01:13:10,296 --> 01:13:12,196
He deserved it, didn't he?

665
01:13:12,899 --> 01:13:14,594
I don't think it's for us to say...

666
01:13:14,801 --> 01:13:18,737
...whether a person deserves
to live or die.

667
01:13:19,372 --> 01:13:22,034
But, Aunt May, he killed Uncle Ben.

668
01:13:22,242 --> 01:13:24,733
Uncle Ben meant the world to us.

669
01:13:24,944 --> 01:13:28,311
But he wouldn't want us living
one second...

670
01:13:28,514 --> 01:13:31,176
...with revenge in our hearts.

671
01:13:33,653 --> 01:13:36,053
It's like a poison. It can...

672
01:13:36,890 --> 01:13:38,983
It can take you over.

673
01:13:40,894 --> 01:13:45,854
Before you know it,
turn us into something ugly.

674
01:13:59,812 --> 01:14:02,542
- He said it was a good idea.
- Yeah.

675
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:48,652
Hello?

676
01:14:48,861 --> 01:14:50,385
Hey, Harry, it's M.J.

677
01:14:50,596 --> 01:14:51,620
Hi.

678
01:14:51,831 --> 01:14:53,230
I need some company.

679
01:14:53,433 --> 01:14:55,833
Are you doing anything?
Can I stop by?

680
01:14:56,035 --> 01:14:58,060
Yeah, sure, come on over.

681
01:14:58,271 --> 01:15:00,535
Okay. Are you sure it's okay?

682
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:03,300
No, I'm not doing anything.
Please, come over.

683
01:15:03,509 --> 01:15:06,137
- Okay, I'll see you soon.
- Great.

684
01:15:06,346 --> 01:15:07,745
Bye.

685
01:15:08,748 --> 01:15:10,909
- Bernard.
- Yes, Mr. Osborn?

686
01:15:11,117 --> 01:15:13,312
We're having a guest.
Can you get some food?

687
01:15:13,519 --> 01:15:15,680
- A guest?
- Yeah, a guest.

688
01:15:15,888 --> 01:15:19,221
- A "guest" guest?
- Will you just get some food?

689
01:15:19,425 --> 01:15:21,052
Right away, sir.

690
01:15:37,944 --> 01:15:40,845
Hey, Mr. Ditkovitch.

691
01:15:41,581 --> 01:15:44,345
- An orange?
- No, thanks.

692
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:48,316
Listen, I'm really sorry
for what happened earlier.

693
01:15:48,521 --> 01:15:51,922
I shouldn't have yelled about that door.
It was nothing to be angry about.

694
01:15:52,125 --> 01:15:53,990
It's no big deal.

695
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:58,287
But if you feel that bad about it,
you can buy me pizza sometime.

696
01:15:58,498 --> 01:16:01,592
- Today's good.
- Okay.

697
01:16:01,801 --> 01:16:04,429
- Have problem with the phone?
- No, no. I was just...

698
01:16:04,637 --> 01:16:06,662
Well, I was trying
to figure out what to say.

699
01:16:06,873 --> 01:16:10,570
If it's a woman you're calling,
then you say:

700
01:16:10,777 --> 01:16:14,110
"You're a good woman.
I am good man."

701
01:16:19,285 --> 01:16:21,082
- Hi, Pete.
- Hi.

702
01:16:21,287 --> 01:16:22,413
He's calling a woman.

703
01:16:22,622 --> 01:16:24,522
Mary Jane?
I think that would be so good...

704
01:16:24,724 --> 01:16:28,683
This is none of your business.
Go. Go. Call.

705
01:16:30,496 --> 01:16:33,021
- You should call.
- Thanks.

706
01:16:35,535 --> 01:16:37,765
- Bye.
- Bye.

707
01:16:51,517 --> 01:16:52,643
Hi.

708
01:16:55,822 --> 01:16:58,256
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

709
01:16:59,425 --> 01:17:00,892
Come on.

710
01:17:05,064 --> 01:17:07,328
- I hope you like peppers.
- I love them.

711
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:33,153
No. Please.

712
01:17:44,504 --> 01:17:46,472
Oh, the butter.

713
01:17:56,616 --> 01:17:58,208
Beautiful.

714
01:18:02,788 --> 01:18:04,449
Check this out.

715
01:18:11,664 --> 01:18:13,928
Well, we can use that part.

716
01:18:15,801 --> 01:18:17,735
You've been dreaming.

717
01:18:17,937 --> 01:18:21,100
Nothing like a little self-deception
to get you through the night.

718
01:18:21,307 --> 01:18:24,105
- All right.
- When did you write that?

719
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:27,074
- Twelfth grade.
- It's intense.

720
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:30,909
- So you want the part?
- I'd love to be in your play.

721
01:18:31,117 --> 01:18:32,607
It's yours.

722
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:38,019
You know, there's not even a scar.

723
01:18:39,659 --> 01:18:41,286
Barely.

724
01:18:58,811 --> 01:19:00,301
- Sorry.
- Me too.

725
01:19:00,513 --> 01:19:04,574
- I didn't mean to do that.
- No, it's okay. Please, forgive me.

726
01:19:06,018 --> 01:19:07,645
Mary Jane.

727
01:19:08,588 --> 01:19:10,317
Mary Jane.

728
01:19:11,123 --> 01:19:13,853
- Mary Jane, please.
- I'm sorry.

729
01:19:14,293 --> 01:19:15,590
Just...

730
01:19:27,707 --> 01:19:31,108
You've taken your eye off the ball.

731
01:19:37,383 --> 01:19:38,782
Harry.

732
01:19:51,864 --> 01:19:53,092
What have you done?

733
01:19:55,835 --> 01:19:57,302
Avenge me!

734
01:20:00,539 --> 01:20:04,566
- My father, he died, right?
- Yeah.

735
01:20:04,777 --> 01:20:06,938
Just wish I could remember
more about him.

736
01:20:07,146 --> 01:20:10,138
Well, he loved you.
That's the main thing.

737
01:20:10,349 --> 01:20:13,409
I swear on my father's grave,
Spider-Man will pay.

738
01:20:14,287 --> 01:20:15,914
Harry.

739
01:20:17,757 --> 01:20:19,691
Remember me?

740
01:20:21,594 --> 01:20:24,427
Yes, Father. I remember.

741
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:27,895
I was right about her. About Peter.

742
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:30,261
About everything.

743
01:20:31,737 --> 01:20:35,468
You know what you must do.
Make him suffer.

744
01:20:35,675 --> 01:20:37,973
Make him wish he were dead.

745
01:20:38,177 --> 01:20:42,011
First, we attack his heart.

746
01:20:52,291 --> 01:20:55,260
Hi, it's me.
Sing your song at the beep.

747
01:20:55,461 --> 01:20:58,259
Hey, M.J. It's Peter.

748
01:21:00,333 --> 01:21:03,200
I wanna talk to you about last night.

749
01:21:04,003 --> 01:21:06,096
I don't know what I was thinking.

750
01:21:06,305 --> 01:21:11,072
I know you were just there
to help and I...

751
01:21:11,277 --> 01:21:14,212
I don't know. I wanna see you.

752
01:21:18,784 --> 01:21:22,481
If you want Peter to live,
you're gonna do something for me.

753
01:21:26,759 --> 01:21:28,249
- Yeah?
- It's Ursula.

754
01:21:28,461 --> 01:21:30,122
Come in.

755
01:21:38,904 --> 01:21:40,565
- Hi, Pete.
- Hi.

756
01:21:40,773 --> 01:21:42,934
There's a phone call for you.

757
01:21:44,377 --> 01:21:46,004
It's Mary Jane, she called back.

758
01:21:46,212 --> 01:21:48,146
- Really?
- Yeah.

759
01:21:49,915 --> 01:21:55,376
- I put the phone on top of the thing.
- Thanks. Okay.

760
01:21:57,523 --> 01:21:59,047
- Hey.
- Hi.

761
01:21:59,258 --> 01:22:01,886
Oh, I'm so glad you called.
I've been trying to...

762
01:22:02,094 --> 01:22:04,858
- Can you meet me?
- You bet.

763
01:22:05,064 --> 01:22:07,430
- Now?
- Okay. Where?

764
01:22:07,633 --> 01:22:09,464
At the bridge in the park.

765
01:22:09,668 --> 01:22:10,965
- On my way.
- Okay.

766
01:22:11,170 --> 01:22:14,105
Okay. Hey. I love you.

767
01:22:33,492 --> 01:22:35,483
You look beautiful.

768
01:22:36,862 --> 01:22:38,352
Peonies.

769
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:43,494
- You okay?
- No.

770
01:22:44,503 --> 01:22:46,494
There's something
I have to tell you, Pete.

771
01:22:47,072 --> 01:22:48,471
Okay.

772
01:22:49,775 --> 01:22:51,367
It's not working.

773
01:22:52,478 --> 01:22:54,036
You and me.

774
01:22:55,214 --> 01:22:56,545
What?

775
01:22:56,949 --> 01:22:59,247
I don't wanna see you anymore.

776
01:22:59,885 --> 01:23:01,648
What are you talking about?

777
01:23:01,854 --> 01:23:03,879
I don't know.

778
01:23:06,659 --> 01:23:08,388
I'm lonely.

779
01:23:09,662 --> 01:23:11,857
You aren't there for me.

780
01:23:13,032 --> 01:23:15,432
I can't do this.

781
01:23:15,634 --> 01:23:21,368
- It's over.
- No. Please. Please don't say that.

782
01:23:21,907 --> 01:23:24,671
I know I've been selfish,
but I can do better. I can change.

783
01:23:24,877 --> 01:23:28,540
- It's not that simple.
- We love each other. I love you.

784
01:23:28,747 --> 01:23:30,806
We have problems.
When people have problems...

785
01:23:31,016 --> 01:23:33,712
...they work it out.
They talk to each other.

786
01:23:38,824 --> 01:23:40,519
Look, you see?

787
01:23:41,794 --> 01:23:43,785
You know what this is?

788
01:23:45,030 --> 01:23:48,193
- You know what I want for us?
- There's someone else.

789
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:51,164
I've fallen in love
with someone else.

790
01:24:12,892 --> 01:24:14,382
Bravo.

791
01:24:24,503 --> 01:24:28,735
She says that she's lonely,
that I'm not there for her.

792
01:24:30,276 --> 01:24:32,506
There's another guy.

793
01:24:35,514 --> 01:24:37,277
Well, how you holding up?

794
01:24:38,050 --> 01:24:39,711
Not good.

795
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:44,687
Harry, I was gonna propose to her.

796
01:24:45,391 --> 01:24:46,858
Really?

797
01:24:49,161 --> 01:24:53,063
Well, she's been going through
a tough time lately. Career.

798
01:24:53,265 --> 01:24:56,063
I mean, a singing waitress
at a jazz club?

799
01:24:56,268 --> 01:24:59,237
It's not exactly
what she had in mind for herself.

800
01:24:59,438 --> 01:25:02,498
Singing waitress? What are you...?
What are you talking about?

801
01:25:02,708 --> 01:25:07,202
Well, she was fired from the show.
Didn't she tell you?

802
01:25:07,613 --> 01:25:08,978
She was fired?

803
01:25:10,683 --> 01:25:15,780
She was fired and she told you?
She didn't tell me?

804
01:25:17,456 --> 01:25:19,890
Well, that's why
I asked you here, Pete.

805
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:23,128
I'm the other guy.

806
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:26,725
What?

807
01:25:26,932 --> 01:25:29,901
Look, she came to me
one afternoon, troubled.

808
01:25:30,102 --> 01:25:32,969
She needed someone
and I was there for her.

809
01:25:33,872 --> 01:25:36,898
I've always loved her, Pete.
You know that.

810
01:25:37,109 --> 01:25:38,872
It just...

811
01:25:39,078 --> 01:25:41,069
...started.

812
01:25:48,487 --> 01:25:51,752
I don't believe this.
I don't... I don't believe you.

813
01:25:51,957 --> 01:25:54,289
Look, I'm really sorry.

814
01:25:55,861 --> 01:25:58,193
I just thought you should know.

815
01:26:06,405 --> 01:26:09,738
- Can I warm you up?
- Yes, please.

816
01:26:11,410 --> 01:26:12,877
How's the pie?

817
01:26:13,946 --> 01:26:15,573
So good.

818
01:27:18,977 --> 01:27:20,740
Would you like a drink?

819
01:27:23,615 --> 01:27:26,106
I'm sorry. What was I thinking?

820
01:27:26,318 --> 01:27:28,809
Bad for the public image, right,
Mr. Key-to-the-City?

821
01:27:29,021 --> 01:27:30,249
What did you do to her?

822
01:27:32,424 --> 01:27:35,120
I did what you failed to do.
I was there for her.

823
01:27:36,061 --> 01:27:38,188
Mary Jane and I,
we understand each other.

824
01:27:38,397 --> 01:27:43,357
- She doesn't know what you are.
- Peter, she knows me very well.

825
01:27:43,569 --> 01:27:47,699
And when she kissed me,
it was just like she used to kiss me.

826
01:27:48,207 --> 01:27:49,868
That taste...

827
01:27:51,543 --> 01:27:52,771
Strawberries.

828
01:28:28,447 --> 01:28:29,971
How'd you like that, Spidey?

829
01:28:33,852 --> 01:28:35,149
That all you got?

830
01:28:42,461 --> 01:28:44,952
- Stings, doesn't it?
- I protected you in high school.

831
01:28:45,164 --> 01:28:47,359
Now I'm gonna kick your little ass.

832
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:36,545
Gonna kill me
like you killed my father?

833
01:29:36,748 --> 01:29:38,875
I'm done trying to convince you.

834
01:29:39,718 --> 01:29:43,154
You took him from me. He loved me.

835
01:29:43,355 --> 01:29:47,223
No. He despised you.

836
01:29:47,426 --> 01:29:49,621
You were an embarrassment to him.

837
01:29:53,465 --> 01:29:57,231
Look at little Goblin Junior.
Gonna cry?

838
01:30:34,172 --> 01:30:36,367
Spider-Man used to
make me feel safe.

839
01:30:36,575 --> 01:30:38,475
Now I'm afraid
to walk home from work.

840
01:30:38,677 --> 01:30:42,306
- My son thought the world of this guy.
- I have a daughter, loves Spider-Man.

841
01:30:42,514 --> 01:30:45,711
- Who's she to look up to?
- This is the guy they gave the key to?

842
01:30:47,085 --> 01:30:49,883
I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye.

843
01:30:51,924 --> 01:30:55,052
- Cheers to the new staff photographer.
- Hey, I just got lucky.

844
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:56,955
This is so wonderful for you.

845
01:30:57,162 --> 01:31:00,757
Well, you might wanna tell J.J.
To make a little more wall space.

846
01:31:05,904 --> 01:31:09,271
Wow, good morning.
It's a beautiful day, huh?

847
01:31:09,474 --> 01:31:11,908
What was it you said?
I'll never get that picture?

848
01:31:12,711 --> 01:31:14,440
There's your hero.

849
01:31:16,048 --> 01:31:19,540
- I never thought he'd really do that.
- See? Right there.

850
01:31:19,751 --> 01:31:22,345
You made a judgment call.
You gotta see it as it is.

851
01:31:22,554 --> 01:31:23,885
Funny you should say that...

852
01:31:24,089 --> 01:31:28,287
...because I was looking through
some old photos and it looks very...

853
01:31:28,493 --> 01:31:30,290
...similar.

854
01:31:31,463 --> 01:31:34,364
Okay. Well, I gotta get back to work.

855
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:38,535
- You're trash, Brock.
- Excuse me?

856
01:31:38,737 --> 01:31:40,637
Your picture's a fake.

857
01:31:42,641 --> 01:31:45,769
Oh, Parker,
you are such a boy scout.

858
01:31:45,978 --> 01:31:47,946
When are you gonna
give a guy a break?

859
01:31:50,048 --> 01:31:52,209
You want forgiveness? Get religion.

860
01:31:52,417 --> 01:31:55,944
- What's going on here?
- Are you guys all right?

861
01:31:59,157 --> 01:32:02,649
Yeah. No, we...
We're just horsing around.

862
01:32:03,161 --> 01:32:07,154
Look, I'm begging you.
If you do this, I will lose everything.

863
01:32:07,366 --> 01:32:09,596
There's not a paper in town
that will hire me.

864
01:32:09,801 --> 01:32:12,099
You should've
thought of that earlier.

865
01:32:12,838 --> 01:32:15,033
What are you doing, Peter?

866
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:19,438
Show this to your editor.
Tell him to check his source next time.

867
01:32:25,617 --> 01:32:27,175
It's a fake.

868
01:32:27,386 --> 01:32:31,322
Empire State
Photographic Department confirms it.

869
01:32:34,993 --> 01:32:36,824
Pack your things.
Get out of my building.

870
01:32:37,362 --> 01:32:39,455
- I was just trying...
- You're fired.

871
01:32:41,099 --> 01:32:43,329
We're gonna have to
print a retraction now.

872
01:32:43,568 --> 01:32:45,593
I haven't printed a retraction
in 20 years.

873
01:32:51,810 --> 01:32:54,404
- Hello.
- Mr. Parker, Dr. Connors here.

874
01:32:54,613 --> 01:32:58,709
Oh, Dr. Connors. How are you?

875
01:32:58,917 --> 01:33:02,080
Quite a specimen
you left me, Parker.

876
01:33:02,554 --> 01:33:07,014
Its chemistry is not unlike
the chondritic meteorites of the '70s.

877
01:33:07,225 --> 01:33:08,385
Thanks.

878
01:33:08,593 --> 01:33:11,084
- That's good.
- You know what, Parker?

879
01:33:13,065 --> 01:33:15,829
- Parker?
- Get me some milk.

880
01:33:16,635 --> 01:33:20,162
It amplifies characteristics
of its host.

881
01:33:20,372 --> 01:33:24,035
- Hey, give me another cookie.
- Especially aggression.

882
01:33:25,110 --> 01:33:26,975
This could be dangerous.

883
01:33:27,179 --> 01:33:30,637
Peter, you didn't keep any, did you?

884
01:33:30,849 --> 01:33:34,512
- You got any with nuts?
- I have some nuts. I could make some.

885
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:36,380
- Go make me some.
- Peter?

886
01:33:36,588 --> 01:33:39,079
No, no, no. Course not.

887
01:33:53,538 --> 01:33:55,369
These shots are so good.

888
01:33:55,574 --> 01:33:58,065
I'd love to shoot you sometime.

889
01:33:58,610 --> 01:34:01,977
Peter Parker. Peter.

890
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:06,446
Parker. Miss Brant, that's not
the position I hired you for.

891
01:34:06,651 --> 01:34:08,175
Black-suit Spider-Man.

892
01:34:09,654 --> 01:34:11,781
Peter, these are incredible.

893
01:34:11,990 --> 01:34:14,823
- We gotta have these, Jonah.
- I'll pay you the usual rate.

894
01:34:16,828 --> 01:34:19,422
If you want the shots,
I'll take the staff job...

895
01:34:19,631 --> 01:34:21,428
...double the money.

896
01:35:46,585 --> 01:35:47,984
Penny.

897
01:35:54,059 --> 01:35:56,687
You are really gonna dig this joint.

898
01:35:58,029 --> 01:36:00,020
Do you think I'm...?
I'm dressed all right?

899
01:36:00,232 --> 01:36:01,756
Too fancy or too...

900
01:36:01,967 --> 01:36:05,960
Are you kidding me?
You're looking fine, babe.

901
01:36:06,171 --> 01:36:09,868
- Thank you.
- Love that little giggle.

902
01:36:12,677 --> 01:36:14,577
Hey, keep it open there, pops.

903
01:36:17,882 --> 01:36:21,318
Oh, this is so cool.

904
01:36:21,519 --> 01:36:24,181
I have never been
to a jazz club before.

905
01:36:27,025 --> 01:36:30,358
Oh, I hope we can get a table.

906
01:36:35,133 --> 01:36:37,533
Find us some shade.

907
01:36:38,703 --> 01:36:40,796
Thanks, hot legs.

908
01:36:41,206 --> 01:36:43,674
Right this way, sir.

909
01:36:51,116 --> 01:36:53,141
Oh, why, thank you.

910
01:36:58,423 --> 01:37:02,325
- I am so loving this.
- Oh, me too.

911
01:37:07,932 --> 01:37:11,390
- Isn't that your old girlfriend?
- Yeah.

912
01:37:11,603 --> 01:37:15,903
- Do you wanna go someplace else?
- Oh, no, no. I'll... I'll be okay.

913
01:37:16,107 --> 01:37:18,940
- Mary Jane, show us what you got.
- I'll take that.

914
01:37:24,649 --> 01:37:27,743
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

915
01:37:36,828 --> 01:37:37,954
Peter?

916
01:37:41,099 --> 01:37:43,033
This is for you.

917
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:50,267
Double-time.

918
01:37:55,447 --> 01:37:57,108
Thanks.

919
01:38:23,875 --> 01:38:25,706
Now dig on this.

920
01:38:27,011 --> 01:38:28,171
That is hot.

921
01:39:09,354 --> 01:39:11,049
That was all for her?

922
01:39:19,764 --> 01:39:21,231
I'm so sorry.

923
01:39:33,711 --> 01:39:36,145
- You all right, Mary Jane?
- I'm fine.

924
01:39:36,347 --> 01:39:37,746
Okay.

925
01:39:40,752 --> 01:39:42,151
Hey.

926
01:39:44,389 --> 01:39:45,651
What's wrong with you?

927
01:39:46,991 --> 01:39:48,390
You.

928
01:39:48,893 --> 01:39:51,885
- Can I help you, sir?
- No.

929
01:39:52,096 --> 01:39:54,121
Is everything okay here, Paul?

930
01:39:54,332 --> 01:39:56,527
Yeah, is everything okay here, Paul?

931
01:39:56,734 --> 01:39:59,100
- Take him out of here.
- Let's go, sir.

932
01:39:59,304 --> 01:40:02,068
- Take your hand off of me.
- Now.

933
01:40:02,273 --> 01:40:05,674
- Okay.
- Hey, get off. Let go.

934
01:40:08,246 --> 01:40:09,907
Peter, stop it!

935
01:40:21,459 --> 01:40:22,824
Who are you?

936
01:40:25,396 --> 01:40:26,920
I don't know.

937
01:41:59,624 --> 01:42:01,489
It's Brock, sir.

938
01:42:01,693 --> 01:42:04,127
Edward Brock Jr.

939
01:42:05,830 --> 01:42:08,424
I come before you today...

940
01:42:10,001 --> 01:42:11,593
...humbled...

941
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:15,597
...and humiliated...

942
01:42:18,476 --> 01:42:20,637
...to ask you for one thing.

943
01:42:26,351 --> 01:42:28,114
I want you to kill Peter Parker.

944
01:43:19,203 --> 01:43:20,170
Parker.

945
01:45:04,275 --> 01:45:06,436
- Hi, Peter.
- Hi.

946
01:45:09,180 --> 01:45:13,344
You don't seem to have changed
the room around very much.

947
01:45:13,818 --> 01:45:18,050
Of course, there's not much
you could do, is there?

948
01:45:24,362 --> 01:45:26,557
When we spoke on the phone...

949
01:45:26,764 --> 01:45:29,198
...I sensed that something
was bothering you...

950
01:45:29,934 --> 01:45:33,301
...so I thought I'd just come by.

951
01:45:35,606 --> 01:45:38,074
How's Mary Jane?

952
01:45:38,509 --> 01:45:40,204
I don't know.

953
01:45:42,580 --> 01:45:45,048
I never heard from you.

954
01:45:45,249 --> 01:45:47,740
Did you ever propose?

955
01:45:51,789 --> 01:45:53,416
You said...

956
01:45:54,425 --> 01:45:57,826
...a husband's gotta put a wife
before himself.

957
01:46:03,167 --> 01:46:05,067
I'm not ready.

958
01:46:07,405 --> 01:46:09,464
But what happened?

959
01:46:10,374 --> 01:46:12,842
You seemed so sure.

960
01:46:14,145 --> 01:46:15,669
Yeah.

961
01:46:17,048 --> 01:46:18,675
I...

962
01:46:29,093 --> 01:46:31,323
I hurt her, Aunt May.

963
01:46:32,730 --> 01:46:34,721
I don't know what to do.

964
01:46:36,634 --> 01:46:40,400
Well, you start
by doing the hardest thing:

965
01:46:41,205 --> 01:46:44,140
You forgive yourself.

966
01:46:47,311 --> 01:46:49,802
I believe in you, Peter.

967
01:46:50,014 --> 01:46:52,847
You're a good person.

968
01:46:53,951 --> 01:46:58,786
And I know you will find a way
to put it right.

969
01:47:06,497 --> 01:47:08,294
In time.

970
01:47:26,417 --> 01:47:28,783
End of the line, Spider-Man.

971
01:47:32,857 --> 01:47:35,121
I want him dead too, Flint.

972
01:47:35,726 --> 01:47:37,990
That's why
I've been looking for you.

973
01:47:38,195 --> 01:47:41,426
Oh, yeah. I know all about you.

974
01:47:41,632 --> 01:47:45,830
Like the fact that Spider-Man
won't let you help your poor daughter.

975
01:47:46,037 --> 01:47:49,302
It's just...
That doesn't seem right to me.

976
01:47:49,507 --> 01:47:54,410
Look, I wanna kill the spider,
you wanna kill the spider.

977
01:47:54,612 --> 01:47:57,843
Together, he doesn't stand a chance.

978
01:47:58,916 --> 01:48:00,941
Interested?

979
01:48:02,353 --> 01:48:03,843
Yeah.

980
01:49:05,816 --> 01:49:06,783
So...

981
01:49:08,352 --> 01:49:09,580
...where to?

982
01:49:10,755 --> 01:49:12,450
All New York is holding its breath...

983
01:49:12,656 --> 01:49:15,250
...as the hostage crisis
continues to unfold.

984
01:49:17,028 --> 01:49:18,256
Just 30 minutes ago...

985
01:49:18,462 --> 01:49:20,521
...police came across
this startling sight:

986
01:49:20,731 --> 01:49:22,824
A young woman,
held hostage in a taxi...

987
01:49:23,034 --> 01:49:25,298
...suspended 80 stories
above the ground...

988
01:49:25,503 --> 01:49:28,336
...in what appears to be
a giant web.

989
01:49:28,539 --> 01:49:31,133
Every attempt by the police
to rescue the hostage...

990
01:49:31,342 --> 01:49:33,105
...has been thwarted
by the Sandman.

991
01:49:36,580 --> 01:49:37,808
Compounding the danger...

992
01:49:38,015 --> 01:49:40,882
...is the appearance
of a strange black-suited figure.

993
01:49:41,085 --> 01:49:44,714
Early reports had believed him
to be the black-suited Spider-Man...

994
01:49:44,922 --> 01:49:48,449
...but he has now been identified
as something entirely different.

995
01:49:50,127 --> 01:49:53,619
The hostage has been identified
as Mary Jane Watson...

996
01:49:53,831 --> 01:49:57,892
...an actress recently seen
in a brief stint on Broadway.

997
01:50:23,627 --> 01:50:25,993
We're now going to take you
live to the scene...

998
01:50:26,197 --> 01:50:27,858
...with Jennifer Dugan. Jennifer?

999
01:50:28,065 --> 01:50:30,556
We're only about
100 feet away now, Hal, and...

1000
01:50:30,768 --> 01:50:34,534
Wait. There seems to be
some kind of activity in the web.

1001
01:50:34,738 --> 01:50:38,265
They seem to be creating
some kind of gigantic lettering.

1002
01:50:41,312 --> 01:50:44,076
Spider-Man's being challenged
to some sort of confrontation.

1003
01:50:44,281 --> 01:50:45,908
And that raises serious questions...

1004
01:50:46,117 --> 01:50:49,280
...about what kind of chance he'd
stand against such overwhelming...

1005
01:50:59,830 --> 01:51:01,161
Harry?

1006
01:51:04,735 --> 01:51:06,703
I need your help.

1007
01:51:07,171 --> 01:51:10,504
I can't take them both,
not by myself.

1008
01:51:17,047 --> 01:51:19,811
You don't deserve my help.

1009
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:24,187
Harry...

1010
01:51:24,922 --> 01:51:26,913
...she needs us.

1011
01:51:31,529 --> 01:51:33,087
Get out.

1012
01:51:49,713 --> 01:51:51,908
If I may, sir?

1013
01:51:52,750 --> 01:51:58,120
I've seen things in this house
I've never spoken of.

1014
01:51:58,622 --> 01:52:00,351
What are you trying to tell me?

1015
01:52:01,192 --> 01:52:03,888
The night your father died...

1016
01:52:04,094 --> 01:52:06,528
...I cleaned his wound.

1017
01:52:08,065 --> 01:52:11,626
The blade that pierced his body...

1018
01:52:11,835 --> 01:52:14,531
...came from his glider.

1019
01:52:15,406 --> 01:52:20,173
I know you're trying to defend
your father's honor...

1020
01:52:20,377 --> 01:52:25,576
...but there's no question
that he died by his own hand.

1021
01:52:28,886 --> 01:52:31,218
I loved your father...

1022
01:52:32,590 --> 01:52:35,491
...as I have loved you, Harry.

1023
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:38,958
As your friends love you.

1024
01:53:26,043 --> 01:53:27,271
Look.

1025
01:53:48,198 --> 01:53:51,656
Spider-Man! Spider-Man!
Spider-Man!

1026
01:53:57,241 --> 01:53:59,175
He seems to have
come out of nowhere...

1027
01:53:59,376 --> 01:54:01,344
...to answer the prayers of the city...

1028
01:54:01,545 --> 01:54:03,536
...just when all hope
seemed to be lost.

1029
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:12,387
Peter. They're gonna kill us both.

1030
01:54:12,589 --> 01:54:16,025
- I'm gonna get you out of this.
- Watch out.

1031
01:54:25,536 --> 01:54:26,935
Hey, Parker.

1032
01:54:27,137 --> 01:54:28,365
My God. Eddie.

1033
01:54:29,039 --> 01:54:30,734
My spider-sense is tingling...

1034
01:54:32,476 --> 01:54:35,172
...if you know what I'm talking about.

1035
01:54:54,264 --> 01:54:56,129
We can find a way to settle this.

1036
01:54:56,333 --> 01:54:57,732
You're so right.

1037
01:54:57,935 --> 01:55:01,393
I'm thinking humiliation.

1038
01:55:02,139 --> 01:55:04,437
Kind of like how you humiliated me.

1039
01:55:05,342 --> 01:55:07,037
Do you remember?

1040
01:55:08,912 --> 01:55:11,676
Do you remember
what you did to me?

1041
01:55:27,197 --> 01:55:30,792
You made me lose my girl.
Now I'm gonna make you lose yours.

1042
01:55:32,669 --> 01:55:34,603
How's that sound, tiger?

1043
01:56:34,531 --> 01:56:36,158
Hold on, Mary Jane!

1044
01:57:06,363 --> 01:57:08,661
Mary Jane!

1045
01:58:09,159 --> 01:58:12,890
It's hard to believe
what's happening.

1046
01:58:13,096 --> 01:58:15,394
The brutality of it.

1047
01:58:16,166 --> 01:58:17,929
I don't know how
he can take any more.

1048
01:58:18,135 --> 01:58:21,662
This could be a tragic day
for the people of New York.

1049
01:58:21,872 --> 01:58:23,840
It could be the end of Spider-Man.

1050
01:58:50,267 --> 01:58:52,462
- Awesome.
- Wicked cool.

1051
01:59:17,527 --> 01:59:18,960
You came.

1052
01:59:26,937 --> 01:59:28,962
Looks like just in the nick of time.

1053
01:59:29,172 --> 01:59:31,640
A couple minutes ago
wouldn't have been so bad either.

1054
01:59:31,842 --> 01:59:33,400
What are you gonna do?

1055
01:59:36,980 --> 01:59:38,811
I may need some help over here.

1056
01:59:39,016 --> 01:59:41,416
I'm a little busy right now.

1057
01:59:42,586 --> 01:59:44,315
Give me your hand.

1058
01:59:58,802 --> 02:00:01,635
Parker! Parker, where...?

1059
02:00:01,838 --> 02:00:03,362
I need a photographer.

1060
02:00:03,573 --> 02:00:04,835
Hey, kid, you want a job?

1061
02:00:05,042 --> 02:00:08,341
Why would I want a job?
I'm just a kid.

1062
02:00:08,545 --> 02:00:11,412
- All right, how much for the camera?
- One hundred bucks.

1063
02:00:11,615 --> 02:00:13,048
A hundred bucks?

1064
02:00:14,985 --> 02:00:18,682
All right, you little crook. Here.

1065
02:00:20,457 --> 02:00:21,754
What the...?

1066
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:25,352
Film's extra.

1067
02:00:31,234 --> 02:00:32,997
Gotcha.

1068
02:00:41,044 --> 02:00:42,306
Pete, up top.

1069
02:01:02,165 --> 02:01:04,133
Mary Jane.

1070
02:01:06,369 --> 02:01:08,132
- This thing got any more?
- Hang on.

1071
02:01:08,338 --> 02:01:09,464
To what?

1072
02:01:13,910 --> 02:01:15,707
- Go, buddy.
- Got her.

1073
02:01:27,090 --> 02:01:28,079
You okay?

1074
02:01:30,260 --> 02:01:31,750
Yeah.

1075
02:01:34,531 --> 02:01:36,897
- Good.
- Hey, Pete.

1076
02:01:39,236 --> 02:01:40,999
Am I interrupting?

1077
02:02:57,280 --> 02:02:59,077
Never wound...

1078
02:02:59,983 --> 02:03:01,974
...what you can't kill.

1079
02:03:05,789 --> 02:03:09,281
Eddie, the suit,
you gotta take it off.

1080
02:03:09,492 --> 02:03:11,153
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

1081
02:03:14,097 --> 02:03:15,826
I know what it feels like.

1082
02:03:16,466 --> 02:03:18,058
It feels good.

1083
02:03:18,268 --> 02:03:20,759
The power. Everything.

1084
02:03:20,971 --> 02:03:23,439
But you'll lose yourself.

1085
02:03:24,040 --> 02:03:25,905
Let it go.

1086
02:03:26,109 --> 02:03:28,100
I like being bad.

1087
02:03:29,279 --> 02:03:31,008
It makes me happy.

1088
02:04:20,530 --> 02:04:21,588
Harry!

1089
02:05:34,671 --> 02:05:36,969
Peter. What are you doing?

1090
02:05:37,974 --> 02:05:39,737
No!

1091
02:05:41,544 --> 02:05:42,533
Eddie!

1092
02:06:02,065 --> 02:06:03,999
- Harry.
- Mary Jane.

1093
02:06:04,200 --> 02:06:05,997
- I'm gonna get help.
- No.

1094
02:06:06,870 --> 02:06:08,235
Stay.

1095
02:06:17,013 --> 02:06:18,640
I didn't want this.

1096
02:06:23,553 --> 02:06:25,748
But I had no choice.

1097
02:06:29,526 --> 02:06:31,585
We always have a choice.

1098
02:06:31,795 --> 02:06:33,990
You had a choice
when you killed my uncle.

1099
02:06:36,533 --> 02:06:38,501
My daughter was dying.

1100
02:06:40,703 --> 02:06:42,534
I needed money.

1101
02:06:47,377 --> 02:06:49,277
I was scared.

1102
02:06:56,820 --> 02:06:59,880
I told your uncle
all I wanted was the car.

1103
02:07:00,090 --> 02:07:01,990
- What is it?
- I need your car.

1104
02:07:02,559 --> 02:07:04,993
He said to me:

1105
02:07:05,195 --> 02:07:07,925
"Why don't you just put down the gun
and go home?"

1106
02:07:12,068 --> 02:07:15,003
I realize now
he was just trying to help me.

1107
02:07:21,778 --> 02:07:24,713
Then I saw my partner
running over with the cash.

1108
02:07:24,914 --> 02:07:27,212
And the gun was in my hand.

1109
02:07:37,727 --> 02:07:39,126
Get in.

1110
02:07:41,064 --> 02:07:43,396
Did a terrible thing to you...

1111
02:07:44,801 --> 02:07:48,168
...and I spent a lot of nights
wishing I could take it back.

1112
02:07:53,476 --> 02:07:56,001
I'm not asking you to forgive me.

1113
02:07:56,980 --> 02:07:59,278
I just want you to understand.

1114
02:08:09,125 --> 02:08:11,685
I've done terrible things too.

1115
02:08:28,011 --> 02:08:30,741
I didn't choose to be this.

1116
02:08:39,522 --> 02:08:41,990
The only thing left of me now...

1117
02:08:44,194 --> 02:08:46,059
...is my daughter.

1118
02:08:58,341 --> 02:09:00,241
I forgive you.

1119
02:09:43,653 --> 02:09:46,554
Hey, pal. How you doing?

1120
02:09:46,756 --> 02:09:48,314
Been better.

1121
02:09:49,926 --> 02:09:51,826
We'll get you through this.

1122
02:09:55,598 --> 02:09:57,065
No.

1123
02:10:04,774 --> 02:10:06,901
I should never have hurt you...

1124
02:10:08,811 --> 02:10:11,075
...said those things.

1125
02:10:12,782 --> 02:10:15,273
None of that matters, Peter.

1126
02:10:17,387 --> 02:10:19,116
You're my friend.

1127
02:10:23,893 --> 02:10:25,656
Best friend.

1128
02:10:44,580 --> 02:10:46,207
Harry.

1129
02:11:32,261 --> 02:11:34,388
Whatever comes our way...

1130
02:11:35,498 --> 02:11:39,662
...whatever battle we have raging
inside us, we always have a choice.

1131
02:11:41,804 --> 02:11:43,863
My friend Harry taught me that.

1132
02:11:44,073 --> 02:11:47,270
He chose to be the best of himself.

1133
02:11:48,177 --> 02:11:51,146
It's the choices
that make us who we are...

1134
02:11:51,347 --> 02:11:54,714
...and we can always choose
to do what's right.
