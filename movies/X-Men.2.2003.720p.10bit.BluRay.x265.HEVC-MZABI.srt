
1
00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:44,587
Mutants. Since the discovery
of their existence,

2
00:00:44,754 --> 00:00:49,884
they have been regarded
with fear, suspicion, often hatred.

3
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:52,220
Across the planet debate rages.

4
00:00:52,387 --> 00:00:55,724
Are mutants the next link
in the evolutionary chain?

5
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,396
Or simply a new species of humanity,
fighting for their share of the world?

6
00:01:01,563 --> 00:01:04,482
Either way, it is an historical fact

7
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:10,613
sharing the world has never been
humanity's defining attribute.

8
00:01:50,987 --> 00:01:55,450
"We are not enemies, but friends.
We must not be enemies."

9
00:01:55,617 --> 00:02:00,872
"Though passion may have strained, it
must not break the bonds of our affection."

10
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:05,960
Lincoln said that in his first inaugural
address as our nation's 16th president.

11
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:08,546
It's one of my favourites.

12
00:02:08,713 --> 00:02:14,093
If you'll please have your tickets ready,
we can begin the tour.

13
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:22,894
Jackie, clear my schedule.
I'm having dinner with my son.

14
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:24,312
Yes, Mr President.

15
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:55,010
Excuse me, sir. Are you lost?

16
00:03:05,854 --> 00:03:08,231
Perimeter breach at visitors' checkpoint.

17
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,529
Multiple subjects.

18
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:18,408
Mr President, security breach.
Jackie, leave. Get him to the car.

19
00:03:20,493 --> 00:03:22,203
Exits not clear. Unknown how many.

20
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,247
Both sides secure.

21
00:03:33,673 --> 00:03:36,134
- Something's in the corridor.
- To the shelter.

22
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:37,385
Not clear.

23
00:03:44,517 --> 00:03:48,855
- It's outside the Oval Office.
- Lock this place down.

24
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:05,288
Don't shoot!

25
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,192
My God.

26
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:17,271
Neanderthals. We once believed that
they were wiped out by years of conflict

27
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:21,609
with the much more advanced branch
of humanity called Cro-Magnon man,

28
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:27,865
but recent research into our DNA suggests
that these two species may have interbred,

29
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:31,285
evolving into modern humans.
In other words, into what?

30
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:33,913
- Us.
- That's right.

31
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:36,874
Artie.

32
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,543
Not here.

33
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,885
Come on. Pay attention.

34
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:04,986
...makes me insane when she does this...

35
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:09,240
What are you looking at? Sick...

36
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:13,703
To the shelter.

37
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,080
They're gonna kill him.

38
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:25,923
Jean? You OK?

39
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,926
Yeah, I'm fine.

40
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:31,971
It's just a headache.

41
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:36,434
It's not just a headache, is it?

42
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:40,396
I wasn't sure how to say this,
but since Liberty Island you've been...

43
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:43,274
- Scott.
- You've been different.

44
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:48,196
My telepathy's been off lately.
I can't focus. I hear everything.

45
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,031
Jean, it's not just your telepathy.

46
00:08:50,198 --> 00:08:53,743
A month ago you had to concentrate
just to levitate a book.

47
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,414
Now when you have a nightmare
the entire bedroom shakes.

48
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,792
My dreams are getting worse.

49
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,634
I keep feeling
something terrible's about to happen.

50
00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:17,308
I would never let anything happen to you.

51
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:20,561
Have you guys seen Bobby and Rogue?

52
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:24,482
Something's happening in the food court.

53
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:27,109
- It's a simple question.
- Why are you being a dick?

54
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:29,195
Yeah, why are you being such a dick?

55
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:31,322
Because I can.

56
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:35,243
Can I have a light?

57
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:42,208
- Sorry. Can't help you out, pal.
- John, knock it off.

58
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:45,127
- Why don't you stop showing off?
- For her?

59
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:48,339
- I can't help it if your girl's getting excited.
- She isn't.

60
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:53,511
- We're trying to have a good time.
- You're the only one having a good time.

61
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,723
That's real cute, man.

62
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,642
What are you gonna do?

63
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:04,021
Suddenly you're not so tough.

64
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:50,526
Bobby, what did you do?

65
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:52,403
I didn't do this.

66
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,905
No. I did.

67
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,585
And the next time
you feel like showing off, don't.

68
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:14,550
- Breaking news.
- We're live from Washington,

69
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:18,012
where there's been an attack
in the Oval Office of the White House.

70
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:23,517
We have been informed that the president
and vice president were not harmed.

71
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,687
Sources say the attack involved
one or more mutants...

72
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:31,233
- I think it's time to leave, Professor.
- I think you're right.

73
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,831
- In my opinion, Magneto's behind this.
- I don't think so, Scott.

74
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:49,293
While Eric could organise
something like this from prison,

75
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,339
it would be irrational
and only hurt his goal of mutant prosperity.

76
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:57,134
- You mean superiority.
- You're right, if Eric had his way.

77
00:11:57,301 --> 00:12:01,847
And, of course, the government
will reintroduce the Registration Act.

78
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,224
Or worse.

79
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:09,146
The president could declare a state of
emergency, place every mutant under arrest.

80
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:14,610
- Do you think the assassin worked alone?
- We'll only know that if we find him first.

81
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:21,325
I've been trying to track him using Cerebro,
but his movements are inexplicably erratic.

82
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:26,997
When I have exact coordinates, Storm, Jean,
I'll need you to take the jet and pick him up.

83
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,503
It was close, wasn't it?

84
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,297
Closer than anyone's admitted.

85
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:41,470
- What do you need, William?
- Your authorisation for a special operation.

86
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:44,348
No, thank you, Mr President.

87
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:47,268
I thought you were here
to talk about school reform.

88
00:12:47,435 --> 00:12:49,645
Funny you should say that, Mr President.

89
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:54,442
- Senator.
- Mr President. Thank you for having me.

90
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:58,821
- Senator Kelly, Colonel William Stryker.
- How do you do?

91
00:12:58,988 --> 00:13:03,367
His department has been dealing with the
mutant phenomenon since before my time.

92
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:06,620
You were a staunch supporter
of the Registration Act,

93
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:10,166
but it seems your ideas on
the mutant problem have changed.

94
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:12,042
For the best, I hope.

95
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:15,045
So what are you proposing, Mr Stryker?

96
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:17,548
May I, Mr President?

97
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,440
We've managed to gather evidence
of a mutant training facility

98
00:13:34,607 --> 00:13:38,068
in the Salem region of upstate New York.

99
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,321
Where did you get this information?

100
00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:44,658
Interrogation of one of the mutant terrorists
from the Liberty Island incident.

101
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:47,077
Eric Lehnsherr?

102
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:50,164
- You have access to him?
- Magneto, yes.

103
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:55,544
We developed the technology
that built his plastic prison.

104
00:13:57,421 --> 00:14:01,258
- This facility is a school.
- Sure it is.

105
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:07,223
- What the hell is that?
- A jet.

106
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,434
- What kind of jet?
- We don't know.

107
00:14:11,477 --> 00:14:15,105
But it comes up out of the basketball court.

108
00:14:21,237 --> 00:14:24,532
If we'd been allowed to do our jobs
before this incident...

109
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,909
All right, listen.

110
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:33,374
William, you enter, you detain,
you question,

111
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:39,964
but the last thing we need to see is the body
of a mutant kid on the six o'clock news.

112
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:49,682
- Mr Stryker?
- Senator Kelly.

113
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,395
This is Yuriko, my personal assistant.

114
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:56,939
- Quite a handshake.
- What can I do for you?

115
00:14:57,106 --> 00:15:00,443
Eric Lehnsherr's prison.
I'd like to arrange a visit.

116
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:02,653
It isn't a petting zoo, Senator.

117
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,658
In this conflict he is the enemy, you're just
a spectator, so why not sit this one out?

118
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:13,706
Conflict? Mr Stryker, do you really
want to turn this into some kind of war?

119
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:20,337
I was piloting black ops missions
in North Vietnam

120
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:23,841
while you were sucking
on your mama's tit at Woodstock.

121
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:27,928
Don't lecture me about war.
This already is a war.

122
00:15:38,314 --> 00:15:41,900
- You're dead. You're so dead.
- You're dead.

123
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:49,450
I don't wanna hurt you.

124
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:52,995
I'm not afraid.

125
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:13,599
Logan.

126
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:17,227
You miss me, kid?

127
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:18,729
Not really.

128
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:21,315
- How are you doing?
- I'm OK. How are you?

129
00:16:21,482 --> 00:16:23,484
- Who's this?
- This is Bobby. He's my...

130
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:25,402
I'm her boyfriend.

131
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:27,863
Call me Iceman.

132
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,910
Right.

133
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:36,830
Boyfriend? So how do you guys...?

134
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:39,083
We're still working on that.

135
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:42,920
Look who's come back. Just in time.

136
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:44,922
For what?

137
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:48,092
- We need a baby-sitter.
- Baby-sitter?

138
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:49,802
Nice to see you again, Logan.

139
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:52,763
Hi, Logan.

140
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:55,224
Hi, Jean.

141
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:58,143
I should go and get the jet ready.

142
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,771
Well, it was good to meet you.

143
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:04,400
- Come on, let's go.
- Bye, Logan. I'll see you later.

144
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:13,701
Storm and I are heading to Boston.
We won't be gone long.

145
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:17,538
The professor wants us to find
a mutant who attacked the president.

146
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:19,415
So it was a mutant.

147
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:25,546
You'll be here when we get back,
unless you plan on running off again.

148
00:17:25,713 --> 00:17:30,217
I could probably think of
a few reasons to stick around.

149
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:32,553
Find what you were looking for, Logan?

150
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:35,305
More or less.

151
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,474
I'll see you boys later.

152
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:41,437
- Be safe, OK?
- You too. Bye.

153
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,564
See ya.

154
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:48,777
Aren't you gonna welcome me home?

155
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:52,448
Your bike needs gas.

156
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:54,074
Then fill her up.

157
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:17,431
Mr Laurio, how long can we keep this up?

158
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:22,936
- How long is your sentence?
- Forever.

159
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:28,192
Not necessarily forever, Mr Lehnsherr.
Just until I've got all that I need.

160
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:31,361
Mr Stryker, how kind of you to visit.

161
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:34,198
Have you come back to ensure
the taxpayers' dollars

162
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:37,951
are keeping me comfortable?

163
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:03,560
Done. You can go.

164
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:08,273
Now...

165
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,861
Mr Lehnsherr.

166
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:18,659
I'd like to have one final talk

167
00:19:18,826 --> 00:19:24,498
about the house that Xavier built
and the machine called Cerebro.

168
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,385
My tolerance for your smoking
in the mansion notwithstanding,

169
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:39,847
smoke that in here
and you'll spend the rest of your days

170
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:42,683
under the belief you are a six-year-old girl.

171
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,937
- Can you do that?
- I'd have Jean braid your hair.

172
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:49,106
Welcome back.

173
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:12,588
- You want me to leave?
- No. Just don't move.

174
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:24,016
These lights represent
every living person on the planet.

175
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,896
The white lights are humans.

176
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:33,775
And these are the mutants.

177
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:39,114
Through Cerebro I'm connected to them,

178
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:41,158
and they to me.

179
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:46,413
You see, Logan?

180
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,041
We're not as alone as you think.

181
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:54,504
I found the base at Alkali Lake.

182
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,423
There was nothing there.

183
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:01,428
The broken line represents the path
of the mutant who attacked the president.

184
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:05,182
I've been finding it difficult
to get a lock on it.

185
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:08,602
Can't you just concentrate harder?

186
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:11,188
If I wanted to kill him, yes.

187
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:15,817
There.

188
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:18,570
Looks like he's finally stopped running.

189
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:37,047
I need you to read my mind again.

190
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:50,477
- The results will be the same as before.
- We had a deal.

191
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:56,233
The mind is not a box that can be simply
unlocked. It's a beehive with a million...

192
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,151
Spare me the lecture.

193
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:01,780
I've no doubt your amnesia,
your adamantium skeleton,

194
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:05,742
the claws are all connected, but...

195
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:11,415
Logan, sometimes the mind
needs to discover things for itself.

196
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:14,584
I promise you we'll talk again when I return.

197
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:19,381
If you would be kind enough
to watch over the children tonight.

198
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:22,968
Scott and I are going to visit an old friend.

199
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:39,860
I'm sending the coordinates
of where the mutant's settled.

200
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:42,904
As soon as you find him,
bring him back to the mansion.

201
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:47,492
- Let's hope he cooperates.
- Yes, for his sake. Good luck.

202
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,062
Stryker, William.

203
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:46,171
What are you doing in here?

204
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:51,843
Garbage.

205
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:42,352
These are the coordinates.

206
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:06,626
He's a teleporter. Must be why
the professor had trouble locating him.

207
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:09,754
We're not here to hurt you.

208
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:13,675
We just wanna talk.

209
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:21,683
- Are you bored yet?
- Oh, yeah.

210
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,562
Sure you don't wanna come down?

211
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:50,378
- You have him?
- He's not going anywhere.

212
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:52,839
Are you?

213
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:55,717
Please don't kill me.
I didn't mean to harm anyone.

214
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:59,095
Why would people
have gotten that impression?

215
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:03,433
- What's your name?
- Wagner. Kurt Wagner.

216
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:12,067
There was so much shooting, such fear.

217
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:14,986
And then there was only pain.

218
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:21,534
I could see it all happening,
but I couldn't stop myself.

219
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:23,995
It was like a bad dream.

220
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:27,665
Perhaps he is testing me.

221
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:34,881
And before you were in the White House,
what do you remember?

222
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:36,716
Nothing.

223
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:39,427
I was here.

224
00:28:44,182 --> 00:28:47,894
- I'd rather get him back to the professor.
- The professor?

225
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:55,652
Did you do these yourself?

226
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:05,870
And what about this?

227
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:30,603
- I need you to read my mind again.
- The results will be the same as before.

228
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:34,149
- You'll be indestructible.
- No memory.

229
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:38,778
Sometimes the mind needs
to discover things for itself.

230
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:40,905
Wolverine.

231
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:46,870
No memory. You'll have no memory.

232
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:20,862
Can't sleep?

233
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:23,156
How can you tell?

234
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:25,241
Cos you're awake.

235
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:27,494
Right. How about you?

236
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,746
I don't sleep.

237
00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:42,550
- Doesn't anybody sleep around here?
- Apparently not.

238
00:30:44,177 --> 00:30:46,888
- Got any beer?
- This is a school.

239
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:49,182
- So that's a no?
- Yeah, that's a no.

240
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:51,434
Is there anything other than chocolate milk?

241
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:54,062
There's soda in that cupboard.

242
00:31:08,326 --> 00:31:10,161
- Thanks.
- No problem.

243
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:21,005
I'll take him from here.

244
00:31:22,507 --> 00:31:24,884
It's all right, Scott.

245
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:27,512
- Nice shades.
- Thanks.

246
00:31:57,292 --> 00:32:00,587
Charles Xavier.
Have you come to rescue me?

247
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:03,339
Sorry, Eric, not today.

248
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:05,258
To what do I owe the pleasure?

249
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:11,180
The assassination attempt.
What do you know about it?

250
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:13,266
Nothing.

251
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:15,768
Only what I read in the papers.

252
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:19,355
You really shouldn't have to ask.

253
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:21,441
What's happened to you?

254
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:25,820
I've had frequent visits
from William Stryker.

255
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:28,239
You remember him, don't you?

256
00:32:31,576 --> 00:32:35,955
His son, Jason, was once
a student of yours, wasn't he?

257
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:38,166
Yes. Years ago.

258
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,961
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to help him.

259
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:44,505
At least, not in the way his father wanted.

260
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:50,511
And now you think taking in Wolverine will
make up for your failure with Stryker's son?

261
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:58,061
- How long you been here?
- A couple of years.

262
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:02,565
And your parents just sent you off
to mutant school?

263
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:06,736
Actually, my parents think
this is a prep school.

264
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:12,700
I see. Well, I suppose lots of prep schools
have their own dorms, campuses...

265
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:14,827
Jets.

266
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:19,207
So you and Rogue.

267
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:23,586
It's not what you think.
I'd like it to be, but it's just...

268
00:33:23,753 --> 00:33:30,718
It's just that it's not easy when you
wanna be closer to someone, but you can't.

269
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:38,059
I've seen how you look at Dr Grey.

270
00:33:38,226 --> 00:33:40,186
Excuse me?

271
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:41,521
Nothin'.

272
00:33:41,896 --> 00:33:44,691
You haven't told him of his past, have you?

273
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:46,609
I've put him on the path.

274
00:33:46,776 --> 00:33:48,861
Logan's mind is still fragile.

275
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:51,280
Is it?

276
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:56,744
Or are you afraid of losing
one of your precious X-Men, old friend?

277
00:34:00,665 --> 00:34:02,625
Eric, what have you done?

278
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:06,796
I'm sorry, Charles.

279
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,258
I couldn't help it.

280
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:13,469
What have you told Stryker?

281
00:34:15,972 --> 00:34:17,598
Everything.

282
00:34:23,396 --> 00:34:25,773
The war has begun.

283
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,155
Scott!

284
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:35,783
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

285
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:13,780
But now and then
every mother needs to get away.

286
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:16,991
Without her, the babies are helpless...

287
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:40,348
Hi.

288
00:35:56,447 --> 00:35:58,449
What is it?

289
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:34,944
You picked the wrong house.

290
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,735
You all right?

291
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:28,122
Stay here.

292
00:38:14,752 --> 00:38:16,671
- This way.
- Let's go.

293
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:37,191
John! Where's Rogue?

294
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:41,237
- I don't know.
- I gotta find her.

295
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:45,992
- Open it.
- Here, take her.

296
00:38:51,288 --> 00:38:55,042
Go on, get in. Let's go. Come on.

297
00:38:57,962 --> 00:39:01,007
Take him. He's stunned.

298
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:02,925
- I can help you.
- Help them.

299
00:39:26,157 --> 00:39:28,117
- Rogue!
- Bobby!

300
00:39:28,284 --> 00:39:30,244
This way.

301
00:39:41,672 --> 00:39:44,759
Come on. Everybody, follow me up here.

302
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:52,016
Move.

303
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:02,943
Come on.

304
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:18,709
Let's go.

305
00:40:21,212 --> 00:40:23,089
Come on, this way.

306
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:29,553
This is it.

307
00:40:31,514 --> 00:40:33,099
Logan.

308
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:36,977
- You wanna shoot me, shoot me.
- Don't shoot him.

309
00:40:37,895 --> 00:40:39,897
Not yet.

310
00:40:41,023 --> 00:40:42,942
Wolverine?

311
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:47,822
I must admit this is certainly
the last place I'd expect to find you.

312
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:50,783
How long has it been? 15 years?

313
00:40:51,784 --> 00:40:53,994
You haven't changed one bit.

314
00:40:54,954 --> 00:40:57,414
Me, on the other hand...

315
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:01,836
Nature.

316
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,301
Wait. We've gotta do something.
They'll kill him.

317
00:41:09,468 --> 00:41:13,222
- He can handle himself. Let's go.
- Bobby.

318
00:41:13,389 --> 00:41:15,391
Please.

319
00:41:15,558 --> 00:41:20,980
I didn't realise Xavier was taking in animals,
even animals as unique as you.

320
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:23,107
Who are you?

321
00:41:24,817 --> 00:41:27,236
Don't you remember?

322
00:41:42,793 --> 00:41:44,420
No!

323
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:49,383
Logan, come on. Let's go.

324
00:42:05,024 --> 00:42:08,402
- Go. I'll be fine.
- But we won't.

325
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:18,954
Go. Keep going.

326
00:42:44,939 --> 00:42:47,233
- Right, get in.
- I'm driving.

327
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:49,818
Maybe next time.

328
00:42:53,072 --> 00:42:55,449
This is Cyclops's car.

329
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:57,159
Oh, yeah?

330
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:19,139
What the hell was that back there?

331
00:43:19,306 --> 00:43:20,933
Stryker.

332
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,977
His name is Stryker.

333
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:26,689
- Who is he?
- I can't remember.

334
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:37,491
Here.

335
00:43:37,658 --> 00:43:39,034
This is yours.

336
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:53,465
- I hate uncomfortable silences.
- What are you doing?

337
00:43:59,638 --> 00:44:02,850
I don't think that's his CD player.

338
00:44:09,523 --> 00:44:12,651
- Sit back.
- Where are we going?

339
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:16,322
Storm and Jean are in Boston.
We'll head that way.

340
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:18,824
- My parents live in Boston.
- Good.

341
00:44:35,007 --> 00:44:36,508
Sergeant?

342
00:44:36,675 --> 00:44:40,095
Most of the mutants
escaped through a series of tunnels.

343
00:44:40,262 --> 00:44:42,097
- We have some in custody.
- How many?

344
00:44:42,264 --> 00:44:43,724
Six, sir.

345
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:12,294
Welcome, Professor.

346
00:45:33,774 --> 00:45:35,609
Take what we need, gentlemen.

347
00:45:38,612 --> 00:45:43,742
This protest underscores a growing concern
among most Americans.

348
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:45,244
Mutant registration...

349
00:45:45,411 --> 00:45:49,498
Why stop there? It'd be easier
to round up mutants by the truckload.

350
00:45:49,665 --> 00:45:53,001
- Or maybe you'd like an all-out war?
- Oh, please.

351
00:45:53,168 --> 00:45:57,423
- Turn that shit off, Lou.
- A lot on your mind?

352
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:03,053
Mr Laurio?

353
00:46:05,347 --> 00:46:07,850
I'm Grace.

354
00:46:18,235 --> 00:46:19,945
You want another beer?

355
00:46:21,572 --> 00:46:23,574
Of course you do.

356
00:46:31,665 --> 00:46:34,835
- You're really aggressive.
- Yes, I am.

357
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:40,674
I've never hooked up with
a girl like you before.

358
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:42,384
I know.

359
00:46:44,553 --> 00:46:48,807
- It's kind of dirty in here, don't you think?
- That's the idea.

360
00:46:48,974 --> 00:46:50,350
Velcro?

361
00:46:50,517 --> 00:46:51,727
Nice.

362
00:46:51,894 --> 00:46:54,897
- Bottoms up.
- I certainly hope so.

363
00:47:11,788 --> 00:47:13,081
Bottoms up.

364
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:37,147
- William...
- Please, Xavier, don't get up.

365
00:47:38,357 --> 00:47:43,445
I call it the neural inhibitor.
It keeps you outta here.

366
00:47:45,656 --> 00:47:48,200
- What have you done with Scott?
- Don't worry.

367
00:47:48,367 --> 00:47:50,953
I'm just giving him a little re-education.

368
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,705
Of course, you know
all about that, don't you?

369
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:57,876
You wanted me to cure your son,
but mutation is not a disease.

370
00:47:58,043 --> 00:48:00,546
You're lying.

371
00:48:01,547 --> 00:48:04,716
You were more frightened of him
than I was.

372
00:48:04,883 --> 00:48:10,013
Just one year after Jason returned
from your school, my wife...

373
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:13,267
You see, he resented us.

374
00:48:13,433 --> 00:48:18,230
He blamed us for his condition,
so he would toy with our minds,

375
00:48:18,397 --> 00:48:22,276
projecting visions and scenarios
into our brains.

376
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:25,737
My wife, in the end,

377
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:32,786
she took a power drill to her left temple
in an attempt to bore the images out.

378
00:48:33,245 --> 00:48:36,456
My boy - the great illusionist.

379
00:48:43,255 --> 00:48:48,927
For someone who hates mutants,
you certainly keep some strange company.

380
00:48:49,094 --> 00:48:54,474
They serve their purpose,
as long as they can be controlled.

381
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:03,108
You arranged the attack on the president.

382
00:49:05,068 --> 00:49:08,363
You didn't even have to read my mind.

383
00:49:10,073 --> 00:49:13,493
I've been working with mutants
as long as you have, Xavier,

384
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:18,624
but the most frustrating thing I've learned is
nobody really knows how many even exist

385
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:20,834
or how to find them.

386
00:49:22,753 --> 00:49:25,047
Except you.

387
00:49:25,213 --> 00:49:28,717
Unfortunately, this little potion
won't work on you, will it?

388
00:49:28,884 --> 00:49:31,011
You're much too powerful for that.

389
00:49:31,178 --> 00:49:34,222
Instead, we'll go right to the source.

390
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:40,228
Allow me to introduce mutant 143.

391
00:49:41,521 --> 00:49:46,193
The fluid secreted by his brain
acts as a mind-controlling agent.

392
00:49:46,985 --> 00:49:49,655
But that's only where it begins.

393
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:52,032
Jason?

394
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:55,077
My God, William. This is your son.

395
00:49:55,243 --> 00:49:58,497
- What have you done to him?
- No, Charles.

396
00:49:58,664 --> 00:50:00,874
My son is dead.

397
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:04,503
Just like the rest of you.

398
00:50:27,401 --> 00:50:29,236
Mom? Dad?

399
00:50:29,403 --> 00:50:31,363
Ronny? Is anybody home?

400
00:50:34,157 --> 00:50:37,577
I'll try and find you some clothes.

401
00:50:37,744 --> 00:50:39,121
Don't burn anything.

402
00:50:52,342 --> 00:50:54,720
I found some of my mom's old clothes.

403
00:50:54,886 --> 00:50:57,931
I think they're from before I was born.

404
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,101
Groovy.

405
00:51:07,733 --> 00:51:09,735
Hello?

406
00:51:13,905 --> 00:51:16,116
Jean. Where are you?

407
00:51:47,063 --> 00:51:50,108
These are my grandmother's.

408
00:51:50,275 --> 00:51:52,486
Thanks.

409
00:51:54,696 --> 00:51:56,698
You won't hurt me.

410
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:07,959
Wow.

411
00:52:18,595 --> 00:52:20,555
I'm sorry.

412
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:24,392
It's OK.

413
00:52:51,878 --> 00:52:54,464
Ronny, next time you...

414
00:52:56,216 --> 00:52:58,552
Who the hell are you?

415
00:53:00,846 --> 00:53:05,851
- Aren't you supposed to be at school?
- Bobby, who is this guy?

416
00:53:07,686 --> 00:53:10,105
This is Professor Logan.

417
00:53:15,944 --> 00:53:17,863
There's something I need to tell you.

418
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:40,802
You're clear.

419
00:53:57,193 --> 00:53:59,863
Have a nice sleep, Lehnsherr?

420
00:54:02,782 --> 00:54:08,955
- There's something different about you.
- Yeah. I was having a good day.

421
00:54:10,707 --> 00:54:12,876
It's not that.

422
00:54:14,044 --> 00:54:16,212
Sit down.

423
00:54:17,422 --> 00:54:19,841
- Sit your ass down.
- What could it be?

424
00:54:22,135 --> 00:54:24,846
What are you doin'?

425
00:54:27,182 --> 00:54:28,934
There it is.

426
00:54:31,061 --> 00:54:33,396
Too much iron in your blood.

427
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:58,505
Mr Laurie, never trust a beautiful woman,
especially one who's interested in you.

428
00:55:48,763 --> 00:55:52,267
When did you first know you were a...

429
00:55:52,434 --> 00:55:54,227
A mutant?

430
00:55:56,479 --> 00:55:58,606
Would you cut that out?

431
00:55:58,773 --> 00:56:02,610
You have to understand. We thought
Bobby was going to a school for the gifted.

432
00:56:02,777 --> 00:56:05,572
- Bobby is gifted.
- We know. We just didn't realise...

433
00:56:05,739 --> 00:56:10,368
We still love you, Bobby.
It's just this mutant problem is a little...

434
00:56:10,535 --> 00:56:12,454
What mutant problem?

435
00:56:13,997 --> 00:56:16,207
...complicated.

436
00:56:16,374 --> 00:56:19,961
- What exactly are you a professor of?
- Art.

437
00:56:21,171 --> 00:56:23,631
You should see what Bobby can do.

438
00:56:36,728 --> 00:56:39,814
I can do a lot more than that.

439
00:56:50,658 --> 00:56:52,118
This is all my fault.

440
00:56:52,285 --> 00:56:57,999
Actually, it's males that carry the mutant
gene and pass it on, so it's his fault.

441
00:57:03,213 --> 00:57:05,173
911. Please state your emergency.

442
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:09,928
I need the police. There are people
in our house. They won't let us leave.

443
00:57:10,095 --> 00:57:14,808
It's believed a manhunt for several fugitives
from the facility is now under way.

444
00:57:18,728 --> 00:57:21,272
Nobody's responding. I can't get a signal.

445
00:57:21,439 --> 00:57:25,527
Why don't you take a break? I'll keep trying.

446
00:57:55,932 --> 00:57:58,226
What are they?

447
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:05,191
They're angelic symbols passed on
to mankind by the archangel Gabriel.

448
00:58:06,276 --> 00:58:08,403
They're beautiful.

449
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:10,905
How many do you have?

450
00:58:11,072 --> 00:58:13,032
One for every sin.

451
00:58:14,117 --> 00:58:16,286
So quite a few.

452
00:58:19,414 --> 00:58:22,167
You and Miss Grey are schoolteachers?

453
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:26,880
Yes. At a school for people like us,
where we can be safe.

454
00:58:27,881 --> 00:58:30,008
Safe from what?

455
00:58:30,175 --> 00:58:32,135
Everyone else.

456
00:58:33,636 --> 00:58:38,266
Outside of the circus
most people were afraid of me.

457
00:58:38,433 --> 00:58:41,936
But I didn't hate them. I pitied them.

458
00:58:43,021 --> 00:58:45,857
Do you know why?

459
00:58:46,024 --> 00:58:52,238
Most people will never know anything
beyond what they see with their own eyes.

460
00:58:53,656 --> 00:58:56,826
I gave up on pity a long time ago.

461
00:59:00,997 --> 00:59:05,668
Someone so beautiful
should not be so angry.

462
00:59:08,713 --> 00:59:12,675
Sometimes anger can help you survive.

463
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:16,679
So can faith.

464
00:59:16,846 --> 00:59:20,683
- Storm, I found an active com device.
- Where?

465
00:59:30,026 --> 00:59:32,987
Oh, God. It's for me.

466
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:42,705
Have you tried not being a mutant?

467
00:59:42,872 --> 00:59:46,000
No one's left, Jean. Soldiers came.

468
00:59:46,167 --> 00:59:47,293
What about the children?

469
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:50,463
I saw them escape.
Not sure about the rest.

470
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:53,091
We can't reach the professor
or Scott either.

471
00:59:53,258 --> 00:59:56,469
- Where are you?
- Boston, with Bobby Drake's family.

472
00:59:56,636 --> 01:00:01,766
- OK. We're on our way.
- And, Storm, make it fast.

473
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:12,026
- We have to go now.
- Why? Logan, what's wrong?

474
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:18,950
Drop the knives
and put your hands in the air.

475
01:00:19,701 --> 01:00:21,536
What's going on here?

476
01:00:21,703 --> 01:00:24,914
- Ronny.
- I said drop the knives.

477
01:00:25,623 --> 01:00:28,293
- Open the door.
- Break it.

478
01:00:30,086 --> 01:00:32,130
Turn around. Up against the wall.

479
01:00:33,089 --> 01:00:37,302
- This is just a misunderstanding.
- Put the knives down.

480
01:00:37,468 --> 01:00:39,846
I can't.

481
01:00:40,513 --> 01:00:42,432
Look.

482
01:00:46,853 --> 01:00:50,440
The rest of you, on the ground now.

483
01:00:51,149 --> 01:00:53,318
Kid, I said on the ground.

484
01:01:00,283 --> 01:01:03,119
We don't wanna hurt you, kid.

485
01:01:07,957 --> 01:01:13,004
You know all those dangerous mutants
you hear about on the news?

486
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,632
I'm the worst one.

487
01:01:39,989 --> 01:01:41,991
Get down.

488
01:03:25,344 --> 01:03:27,638
- Who the hell is this?
- Kurt Wagner.

489
01:03:27,805 --> 01:03:30,808
In the circus I was known as
"The Incredible Nightcrawler".

490
01:03:30,975 --> 01:03:34,395
- Save it. Storm.
- We're outta here.

491
01:03:55,374 --> 01:03:57,835
Jason, stop it.

492
01:04:21,484 --> 01:04:24,111
It's all right. You can come out.

493
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:26,072
Have they gone?

494
01:04:30,535 --> 01:04:33,496
- Where are all the other students?
- I don't know.

495
01:04:33,663 --> 01:04:36,290
We'll have to find them, won't we?

496
01:04:42,296 --> 01:04:44,298
We'll use Cerebro.

497
01:04:47,385 --> 01:04:49,470
Come on.

498
01:04:58,187 --> 01:05:00,439
How far are we?

499
01:05:00,606 --> 01:05:04,694
We're actually coming up
on the mansion now.

500
01:05:05,278 --> 01:05:08,114
I've got two signals approaching.

501
01:05:09,282 --> 01:05:10,324
Coming in fast.

502
01:05:16,247 --> 01:05:19,500
Unidentified aircraft,
you are ordered to descend to 20,000ft.

503
01:05:19,667 --> 01:05:24,297
Return with our escort to Hanscom Air Force
Base. You have ten seconds to comply.

504
01:05:24,463 --> 01:05:27,258
- Wow. Somebody's angry.
- I wonder why.

505
01:05:27,425 --> 01:05:31,596
We are coming up alongside you
to escort you to Hanscom Air Force Base.

506
01:05:31,762 --> 01:05:33,222
Lower your altitude now.

507
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:43,274
Repeat: lower your altitude to 20,000ft.
This is your last warning.

508
01:05:46,777 --> 01:05:48,821
They're falling back.

509
01:05:51,532 --> 01:05:54,702
They're marking us.
They're gonna fire. Hang on.

510
01:06:05,421 --> 01:06:07,340
I gotta shake 'em.

511
01:06:13,888 --> 01:06:16,057
- Please don't do that again.
- I agree.

512
01:06:18,726 --> 01:06:21,771
Don't we have any weapons in this heap?

513
01:06:43,751 --> 01:06:45,586
Warning.

514
01:07:28,629 --> 01:07:31,632
Everybody OK back there?

515
01:07:38,806 --> 01:07:40,307
My God. There's two of 'em.

516
01:07:59,201 --> 01:08:00,745
There's one more.

517
01:08:02,496 --> 01:08:03,956
Jean?

518
01:08:06,375 --> 01:08:07,293
Oh, God.

519
01:08:17,136 --> 01:08:19,597
- Rogue!
- No!

520
01:09:01,472 --> 01:09:03,140
- Jean?
- It's not me.

521
01:09:17,655 --> 01:09:20,491
When will these people learn how to fly?

522
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:40,177
Thank you.

523
01:09:47,685 --> 01:09:52,523
- Can you hear what they're saying?
- I could take a closer look.

524
01:09:53,274 --> 01:09:58,863
His name is Colonel William Stryker, and
he invaded your mansion for one purpose.

525
01:09:59,029 --> 01:10:01,949
He wanted Cerebro.

526
01:10:02,116 --> 01:10:04,577
Or enough of it to build one of his own.

527
01:10:05,244 --> 01:10:09,331
That doesn't make sense. Stryker
would need the professor to operate it.

528
01:10:09,498 --> 01:10:12,960
Which I think is the only reason
my old friend's still alive.

529
01:10:13,127 --> 01:10:15,129
My God.

530
01:10:16,505 --> 01:10:18,215
What are you all so afraid of?

531
01:10:18,382 --> 01:10:22,928
While Cerebro is working, Charles's mind
is connected to every person on the planet.

532
01:10:23,095 --> 01:10:26,348
If he were forced to concentrate
hard enough on a particular group -

533
01:10:26,515 --> 01:10:28,726
mutants, for example -

534
01:10:28,893 --> 01:10:31,896
he could kill us all.

535
01:10:32,062 --> 01:10:36,275
Wait. How would Stryker even know
where to find Cerebro in the first place?

536
01:10:39,904 --> 01:10:42,239
Because I told him.

537
01:10:42,406 --> 01:10:45,618
I helped Charles build it, remember?

538
01:10:45,784 --> 01:10:50,122
Mr Stryker has powerful methods
of persuasion,

539
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:52,958
even against a mutant as strong as Charles.

540
01:10:54,251 --> 01:10:57,880
- So who is this Stryker anyway?
- He's a military scientist.

541
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:01,967
He spent his whole life
trying to solve the mutant problem.

542
01:11:02,134 --> 01:11:06,889
If you want a more intimate perspective,
why don't you ask Wolverine?

543
01:11:08,057 --> 01:11:10,184
You don't remember, do you?

544
01:11:10,351 --> 01:11:14,772
William Stryker - the only other man I know
who can manipulate adamantium.

545
01:11:14,939 --> 01:11:19,401
The metal on your bones -
it carries his signature.

546
01:11:20,986 --> 01:11:23,530
- But the professor...
- He trusted you

547
01:11:23,697 --> 01:11:26,408
to discover this on your own.

548
01:11:26,575 --> 01:11:29,161
He gives you more credit than I do.

549
01:11:29,328 --> 01:11:31,622
Why do you need us?

550
01:11:31,789 --> 01:11:34,291
Mystique has discovered plans of a base

551
01:11:34,458 --> 01:11:37,670
that Stryker's been operating
out of for decades.

552
01:11:37,836 --> 01:11:40,547
We know it's where he's building
the second Cerebro,

553
01:11:40,714 --> 01:11:44,134
but we don't know where the base is.

554
01:11:44,301 --> 01:11:46,637
And I believe one of you might.

555
01:11:46,804 --> 01:11:48,806
The professor already tried.

556
01:11:48,973 --> 01:11:52,267
Once again, you think it's all about you.

557
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:58,565
Hello.

558
01:12:03,028 --> 01:12:05,823
I didn't mean to snoop.

559
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:08,325
Just try and relax.

560
01:12:23,966 --> 01:12:26,343
I'm sorry.

561
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:33,183
- Stryker's at Alkali Lake.
- That's where the professor sent me.

562
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:36,729
- There's nothing left.
- Nothing left on the surface.

563
01:12:36,895 --> 01:12:39,356
The base is underground.

564
01:12:57,124 --> 01:12:59,126
You OK?

565
01:13:00,919 --> 01:13:02,546
- Yeah.
- You sure?

566
01:13:02,713 --> 01:13:04,673
How we doin'?

567
01:13:05,674 --> 01:13:09,803
Not good. It looks like four or five hours
before I can get it off the ground.

568
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:12,347
That's not what I meant.

569
01:13:13,348 --> 01:13:17,644
- I'm just worried about Scott.
- I'm worried about you.

570
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:20,647
That was some display of power up there.

571
01:13:20,814 --> 01:13:25,652
- Obviously it wasn't enough.
- Come on.

572
01:13:28,655 --> 01:13:30,491
I love him.

573
01:13:33,118 --> 01:13:34,870
Do you?

574
01:13:35,662 --> 01:13:39,500
Girls flirt with the dangerous guy, Logan.
They don't take him home.

575
01:13:39,666 --> 01:13:42,669
They marry the good guy.

576
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:45,631
I could be the good guy.

577
01:13:45,798 --> 01:13:48,092
Logan, the good guy sticks around.

578
01:13:55,349 --> 01:13:57,351
Please.

579
01:13:58,018 --> 01:14:00,604
- Don't make me do this.
- Do what?

580
01:14:01,647 --> 01:14:03,649
This.

581
01:14:13,367 --> 01:14:15,369
Excuse me.

582
01:14:16,245 --> 01:14:21,333
They say you can imitate anybody,
even their voice.

583
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:24,378
Even their voice.

584
01:14:24,545 --> 01:14:28,549
Then why not stay in disguise all the time?

585
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,885
Look like everyone else?

586
01:14:32,052 --> 01:14:34,721
Cos we shouldn't have to.

587
01:15:03,834 --> 01:15:05,586
Look...

588
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:34,865
- No one's ever left a scar quite like you.
- What do you want, an apology?

589
01:15:35,032 --> 01:15:36,992
You know what I want.

590
01:15:39,161 --> 01:15:41,163
But what do you want?

591
01:15:53,258 --> 01:15:55,344
What do you really want?

592
01:15:57,429 --> 01:15:59,431
I want you to get out.

593
01:16:04,853 --> 01:16:06,813
Jesus.

594
01:16:12,945 --> 01:16:15,072
Why don't we get uniforms?

595
01:16:15,239 --> 01:16:19,201
They're on order.
Should arrive in a few years.

596
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,170
We love what you've done with your hair.

597
01:16:33,006 --> 01:16:35,467
Come on, let's go.

598
01:16:42,683 --> 01:16:45,686
They say you're the bad guy.

599
01:16:47,896 --> 01:16:50,440
Is that what they say?

600
01:16:52,776 --> 01:16:56,655
It's a dorky-looking helmet.
What's it for?

601
01:16:56,822 --> 01:17:02,744
This dorky-looking helmet is the only thing
that'll protect me from the real bad guys.

602
01:17:07,874 --> 01:17:10,168
What's your name?

603
01:17:10,335 --> 01:17:12,129
John.

604
01:17:13,005 --> 01:17:15,632
What's your real name, John?

605
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,557
Pyro.

606
01:17:23,724 --> 01:17:25,768
Quite a talent you have there, Pyro.

607
01:17:25,934 --> 01:17:28,895
I can only manipulate the fire.

608
01:17:29,062 --> 01:17:30,689
I can't create it.

609
01:17:31,273 --> 01:17:36,570
You are a god among insects.
Never let anyone tell you different.

610
01:17:56,548 --> 01:18:01,178
Sir, the machine has been completed
to all specifications.

611
01:18:01,345 --> 01:18:02,971
Good.

612
01:18:06,975 --> 01:18:10,520
If I may ask, sir,
why are we keeping the children here?

613
01:18:12,022 --> 01:18:14,024
I'm a scientist, Sergeant Lyman.

614
01:18:14,191 --> 01:18:18,362
When I build a machine,
I wanna make sure that it's working.

615
01:18:24,951 --> 01:18:29,247
All right, this is a topographic map
of the dam. This is the spillway.

616
01:18:29,414 --> 01:18:32,834
See these density changes in the terrain?
They're tire tracks.

617
01:18:33,001 --> 01:18:35,128
That's the entrance.

618
01:18:35,295 --> 01:18:38,382
And this shows the depth of the ice
covering the ground.

619
01:18:38,548 --> 01:18:43,970
- This is recent water activity.
- If we go in, Stryker could flood the spillway.

620
01:18:44,137 --> 01:18:46,473
Can you teleport inside?

621
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:52,145
I have to be able to see where I'm going,
otherwise I could wind up inside a wall.

622
01:18:52,312 --> 01:18:54,439
I'll go.

623
01:18:54,606 --> 01:18:56,483
I've a hunch he'll want me alive.

624
01:18:56,650 --> 01:19:00,946
Whoever goes into the dam needs to be
able to operate the spillway mechanism.

625
01:19:01,113 --> 01:19:03,407
What do you intend to do?

626
01:19:03,573 --> 01:19:06,410
Scratch it with your claws?

627
01:19:07,411 --> 01:19:10,414
- I'll take my chances.
- But I won't.

628
01:19:31,893 --> 01:19:35,897
Sir, there's someone
coming down the spillway.

629
01:19:40,694 --> 01:19:42,529
- I'm flooding it.
- Wait.

630
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:50,203
Stryker!

631
01:20:03,842 --> 01:20:06,052
Look who's come home.

632
01:20:19,941 --> 01:20:21,943
Move, and you're dead.

633
01:20:52,432 --> 01:20:57,062
The one thing I know better than anyone
is my own work. Seal the room. Shoot it.

634
01:20:57,229 --> 01:20:59,481
Seal the room. Step away.

635
01:21:14,538 --> 01:21:19,418
We have a metamorph loose.
Could be anybody.

636
01:21:31,263 --> 01:21:34,391
- Can you override the spillway mechanism?
- Only from that room.

637
01:21:34,558 --> 01:21:36,935
- That's why the doors are so thick.
- Really?

638
01:21:37,102 --> 01:21:40,772
Get some charges. Blow the doors open.

639
01:21:41,398 --> 01:21:44,359
Take out these cameras.

640
01:21:46,695 --> 01:21:48,822
I'm in.

641
01:21:48,989 --> 01:21:52,534
- She's good.
- You have no idea.

642
01:22:04,504 --> 01:22:06,840
Fire in the hole.

643
01:22:12,721 --> 01:22:14,723
Move.

644
01:22:31,364 --> 01:22:35,285
She's opened the spillway doors.
More mutants have entered.

645
01:22:35,452 --> 01:22:38,204
- How many?
- We've lost coms - electrical interference.

646
01:22:38,371 --> 01:22:42,083
Sergeant Lyman, gather your men
and meet me outside Cerebro.

647
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:46,880
You, carry on. When I come back
I want this door open all the way.

648
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:02,062
Welcome, Professor.

649
01:23:02,228 --> 01:23:04,981
Don't leave me alone. Please?

650
01:23:05,148 --> 01:23:07,776
You can come inside.

651
01:24:02,622 --> 01:24:03,873
Found it?

652
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:07,794
A large portion of energy from the dam
has been diverted to this chamber.

653
01:24:07,961 --> 01:24:10,171
- Cerebro.
- There it is.

654
01:24:10,338 --> 01:24:12,716
Can you shut it down from here?

655
01:24:12,882 --> 01:24:16,511
- Come. There's little time.
- Not without us.

656
01:24:19,389 --> 01:24:22,225
My God. The children.

657
01:24:22,392 --> 01:24:24,894
Kurt, will you come with me?

658
01:24:25,061 --> 01:24:29,023
- Where are they?
- In a cell one level down.

659
01:24:30,859 --> 01:24:34,696
We'll get the children
and meet you at Cerebro.

660
01:24:34,863 --> 01:24:37,699
I'll try to find Scott and the professor.

661
01:24:37,866 --> 01:24:41,953
- Will you be all right without us?
- I'll be fine.

662
01:24:43,496 --> 01:24:45,498
Where's Logan?

663
01:24:50,503 --> 01:24:52,422
He's gone.

664
01:24:53,798 --> 01:24:56,718
You. Set up a perimeter.

665
01:25:36,716 --> 01:25:38,551
Jason.

666
01:25:45,016 --> 01:25:47,101
It's time.

667
01:25:52,941 --> 01:25:55,485
Time to find our friends.

668
01:26:00,782 --> 01:26:02,951
Is it time to find our friends?

669
01:26:04,035 --> 01:26:06,162
All of them.

670
01:26:06,329 --> 01:26:08,915
All of the mutants.

671
01:26:09,082 --> 01:26:11,125
Everywhere.

672
01:26:11,918 --> 01:26:14,671
- Everywhere.
- That's right.

673
01:26:14,838 --> 01:26:17,799
- Every one of them?
- Yes.

674
01:26:17,966 --> 01:26:19,592
Good.

675
01:26:20,426 --> 01:26:23,638
It's time to bring it to an end.

676
01:26:26,307 --> 01:26:27,976
Make me proud.

677
01:26:55,837 --> 01:26:59,340
Just don't move.

678
01:27:01,634 --> 01:27:04,053
Kill anyone who approaches.

679
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:06,431
Even if it's me.

680
01:27:32,332 --> 01:27:33,917
Go! I'll take care of him.

681
01:27:34,083 --> 01:27:37,712
This is one lovers' quarrel
we cannot get involved in, my dear.

682
01:27:48,723 --> 01:27:51,184
Scott!

683
01:27:52,894 --> 01:27:56,522
- Help us, anybody!
- Listen.

684
01:27:56,689 --> 01:27:58,858
- Help!
- Get us out of here.

685
01:27:59,025 --> 01:28:00,693
- Jubilee?
- Storm.

686
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:02,862
We're coming.

687
01:28:39,315 --> 01:28:41,317
Scott, don't do this.

688
01:29:34,328 --> 01:29:37,415
Jean, no, it's OK. It's me.

689
01:29:38,458 --> 01:29:40,585
I'm so sorry.

690
01:29:41,836 --> 01:29:44,505
- I thought I'd lost you.
- Oh, God.

691
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:49,761
I'm so sorry. I could see you,
but I couldn't stop myself. I tried.

692
01:29:49,927 --> 01:29:53,222
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

693
01:29:56,184 --> 01:29:58,478
- My leg.
- Easy.

694
01:30:02,482 --> 01:30:04,650
Something's wrong.

695
01:30:13,951 --> 01:30:15,787
My God.

696
01:30:19,832 --> 01:30:24,795
Have you found the mutants yet?
Have you found all of them?

697
01:30:24,962 --> 01:30:27,507
I'm trying. There are so many of them.

698
01:30:27,673 --> 01:30:30,468
Then concentrate.

699
01:32:37,178 --> 01:32:40,556
There's a tricky thing about adamantium.

700
01:32:40,723 --> 01:32:46,812
If you ever manage
to process its raw, liquid form,

701
01:32:46,979 --> 01:32:49,398
you gotta keep it that way.

702
01:32:50,191 --> 01:32:52,818
Keep it hot.

703
01:32:52,985 --> 01:32:56,906
Because once the metal cools,
it's indestructible.

704
01:32:59,492 --> 01:33:01,911
But you already know that.

705
01:33:03,496 --> 01:33:07,375
I used to think you were
one of a kind, Wolverine.

706
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:13,172
I was wrong.

707
01:33:31,732 --> 01:33:33,734
Holy shit.

708
01:35:18,506 --> 01:35:20,049
That's it.

709
01:35:22,843 --> 01:35:26,389
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm sick of this. I'm going in.

710
01:35:26,555 --> 01:35:29,141
John, they told us to stay here.

711
01:35:29,308 --> 01:35:31,310
You always do as you're told?

712
01:36:32,496 --> 01:36:36,917
Find all the mutants.
All of them. Find them.

713
01:36:38,419 --> 01:36:41,922
Find all the mutants.
Everywhere. Each one. All of them.

714
01:36:42,089 --> 01:36:43,966
Good. Kill them.

715
01:37:33,182 --> 01:37:35,476
Concentrate. Concentrate harder.

716
01:37:35,643 --> 01:37:42,107
Now find them all. Find all the mutants.
Concentrate harder. Each and every one.

717
01:37:42,274 --> 01:37:47,112
Find all the mutants.
Kill them all. Find them all. Kill them.

718
01:37:49,740 --> 01:37:52,034
Cerebro...

719
01:37:52,201 --> 01:37:55,204
We're too late.

720
01:38:04,129 --> 01:38:06,257
Eric, hurry.

721
01:38:54,013 --> 01:38:56,015
That's strange.

722
01:39:34,136 --> 01:39:38,891
How does it look from there, Charles?
Still fighting the good fight?

723
01:39:39,767 --> 01:39:44,980
From here, it doesn't look like
they're playing by your rules.

724
01:39:45,147 --> 01:39:48,192
Maybe it's time to play by theirs.

725
01:40:25,187 --> 01:40:27,606
There's been a change of plan.

726
01:40:46,792 --> 01:40:48,794
Goodbye, Charles.

727
01:41:05,310 --> 01:41:07,312
There's been a change of plans.

728
01:41:07,479 --> 01:41:13,152
Now find them. Focus. Find them all.
The humans. Find all of them.

729
01:41:13,318 --> 01:41:15,946
Every one.

730
01:41:34,548 --> 01:41:36,884
How does it feel, bub?

731
01:41:40,053 --> 01:41:43,432
- Why did you come back?
- You cut me open. You took my life.

732
01:41:43,599 --> 01:41:47,102
You make it sound as if
I stole something from you.

733
01:41:47,269 --> 01:41:51,732
As I recall, it was you
who volunteered for the procedure.

734
01:41:51,899 --> 01:41:53,275
Who am I?

735
01:41:53,442 --> 01:41:58,155
You are just a failed experiment.

736
01:42:01,241 --> 01:42:04,244
If you really knew about your past -

737
01:42:04,411 --> 01:42:08,874
what kind of person you were,
the work we did together...

738
01:42:10,459 --> 01:42:12,503
People don't change, Wolverine.

739
01:42:12,669 --> 01:42:15,839
You were an animal then.
You're an animal now.

740
01:42:16,006 --> 01:42:18,634
I just gave you claws.

741
01:42:42,282 --> 01:42:44,243
What the hell is that?

742
01:42:44,409 --> 01:42:47,746
- What is it?
- The dam's ruptured.

743
01:42:47,913 --> 01:42:52,584
It's gonna flood water into the spillway.
It's trying to relieve the pressure.

744
01:42:52,751 --> 01:42:57,089
It's too late. In a few minutes
we'll all be underwater.

745
01:42:57,256 --> 01:42:59,883
Come with me,
and I'll tell you all you wanna know.

746
01:43:00,050 --> 01:43:04,054
You can't help your friends.
They're as good as dead, Wolverine.

747
01:43:04,555 --> 01:43:06,598
You're a survivor.

748
01:43:06,765 --> 01:43:09,017
Always have been.

749
01:43:09,476 --> 01:43:13,272
I thought I was just an animal with claws.

750
01:43:17,192 --> 01:43:19,444
If we die, you die.

751
01:43:28,370 --> 01:43:30,998
There are no answers that way, Wolverine.

752
01:43:31,373 --> 01:43:35,085
Find all the humans. Each and every one.

753
01:43:35,252 --> 01:43:38,714
Find them. Find all the humans. Kill them.

754
01:43:42,009 --> 01:43:44,803
- What is this?
- Cerebro.

755
01:43:49,349 --> 01:43:52,102
- Jean, are you OK?
- I'm fine.

756
01:43:52,269 --> 01:43:53,854
What's happening?

757
01:43:54,021 --> 01:43:56,857
Professor's still in there,
with another mutant.

758
01:43:57,024 --> 01:44:00,110
He's trapped in some kind of illusion.

759
01:44:01,028 --> 01:44:05,741
Oh, my God. Magneto's reversed Cerebro.
It's not targeting mutants any more.

760
01:44:05,908 --> 01:44:09,745
- Who is it targeting?
- Everyone else.

761
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:28,722
Impossible.

762
01:44:55,707 --> 01:44:59,127
- Stand back.
- No. His mind is connected to Cerebro.

763
01:44:59,294 --> 01:45:02,547
Opening it could kill him
and everyone his mind is linked to.

764
01:45:02,714 --> 01:45:05,884
Wait. Kurt, I need you to take me inside.

765
01:45:06,051 --> 01:45:08,053
Who is this guy? Who are you?

766
01:45:08,220 --> 01:45:10,931
My name is Kurt Wagner,
but in the circus...

767
01:45:11,098 --> 01:45:13,225
He's a teleporter.

768
01:45:13,392 --> 01:45:17,145
I told you. If I can't see where I'm going...

769
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:19,564
I have faith in you.

770
01:45:22,693 --> 01:45:25,946
Don't believe anything you see in there.

771
01:45:30,283 --> 01:45:34,079
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

772
01:45:34,246 --> 01:45:37,165
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done on Earth...

773
01:45:38,458 --> 01:45:40,627
as it is in heaven.

774
01:45:51,471 --> 01:45:53,348
Hello.

775
01:45:54,975 --> 01:45:57,644
What are you looking for?

776
01:45:59,312 --> 01:46:02,274
Professor, can you hear me?

777
01:46:02,441 --> 01:46:04,735
You've got to stop Cerebro now.

778
01:46:05,819 --> 01:46:08,405
Who are you talking to?

779
01:46:09,281 --> 01:46:11,575
Don't move.

780
01:46:11,742 --> 01:46:14,286
But she's just a little girl.

781
01:46:14,453 --> 01:46:16,455
No, she's not.

782
01:46:19,249 --> 01:46:21,918
I've got my eyes on you.

783
01:46:27,174 --> 01:46:29,176
Mr Stryker.

784
01:46:30,510 --> 01:46:33,388
Funny we keep running into each other.

785
01:46:33,555 --> 01:46:36,600
Mark my words, it'll never happen again.

786
01:46:40,479 --> 01:46:43,732
Kurt, it's about to get very cold in here.

787
01:46:44,357 --> 01:46:46,943
I'm not going anywhere.

788
01:46:52,949 --> 01:46:54,451
What are you doing?

789
01:47:32,447 --> 01:47:36,743
Find all the humans.
Kill them. Every single one of them.

790
01:47:39,204 --> 01:47:41,665
Focus. Find all the humans.

791
01:47:51,133 --> 01:47:52,384
Stop it!

792
01:48:01,977 --> 01:48:03,770
Jason.

793
01:48:04,980 --> 01:48:07,190
He's gonna be so angry at me.

794
01:48:34,676 --> 01:48:38,513
Logan, where are you?

795
01:49:08,668 --> 01:49:11,004
We have to go through the spillway.

796
01:49:49,584 --> 01:49:52,504
You don't wanna go that way. Trust me.

797
01:50:02,555 --> 01:50:05,392
There's another way out of here.

798
01:50:38,383 --> 01:50:40,719
The helicopter was right here.

799
01:51:23,928 --> 01:51:26,723
I will take him.

800
01:51:53,792 --> 01:51:58,046
It's OK, Rogue. You can let go, honey.

801
01:51:58,213 --> 01:52:00,590
- Go. I'll be fine.
- You sure?

802
01:52:14,521 --> 01:52:16,773
Who has the answers, Wolverine?

803
01:52:17,607 --> 01:52:19,651
Those people?

804
01:52:19,818 --> 01:52:21,986
That creature in your arms?

805
01:52:37,794 --> 01:52:40,213
I'll take my chances with him.

806
01:52:42,132 --> 01:52:46,344
One day someone will finish
what I've started, Wolverine.

807
01:52:46,511 --> 01:52:48,471
One day!

808
01:52:58,898 --> 01:53:01,401
We've got to get to Washington.

809
01:53:04,237 --> 01:53:07,365
I fear this has gone beyond Alkali Lake.

810
01:53:09,909 --> 01:53:11,911
I got him.

811
01:53:13,580 --> 01:53:15,582
You OK?

812
01:53:16,583 --> 01:53:18,585
I am now.

813
01:53:25,884 --> 01:53:27,802
- What's wrong?
- Thrusters off line.

814
01:53:27,969 --> 01:53:31,139
- So fix it.
- Has anyone seen John?

815
01:53:31,306 --> 01:53:34,017
Pyro? Where the hell is he?

816
01:53:34,184 --> 01:53:36,686
He's with Magneto.

817
01:53:42,525 --> 01:53:44,402
Come on.

818
01:53:44,569 --> 01:53:47,030
Oh, no. We've lost the power.

819
01:53:57,499 --> 01:54:00,835
There's power in the fuel cells...

820
01:54:48,299 --> 01:54:51,261
- Storm, we need some external power.
- Jean?

821
01:54:52,345 --> 01:54:54,222
Where's Jean?

822
01:54:55,807 --> 01:54:57,892
She's outside.

823
01:55:12,115 --> 01:55:14,075
We're not leaving. Lower the ramp.

824
01:55:28,214 --> 01:55:30,800
Storm, lower it.

825
01:55:30,967 --> 01:55:32,176
I can't.

826
01:55:54,282 --> 01:55:57,118
She's controlling the jet.

827
01:56:01,956 --> 01:56:05,543
- You, get her, now.
- She's not letting me.

828
01:56:05,710 --> 01:56:06,878
Dammit.

829
01:56:14,469 --> 01:56:17,138
I know what I'm doing.

830
01:56:17,305 --> 01:56:19,140
- This is...
- ...the only way.

831
01:56:21,768 --> 01:56:23,436
Jean...

832
01:56:23,603 --> 01:56:25,563
Listen to me.

833
01:56:26,939 --> 01:56:28,608
Don't do this.

834
01:56:28,775 --> 01:56:31,235
Goodbye.

835
01:56:59,263 --> 01:57:01,516
She's gone.

836
01:57:04,769 --> 01:57:07,897
Don't say that. We gotta go back.

837
01:57:08,064 --> 01:57:10,024
- She's gone.
- No!

838
01:57:29,752 --> 01:57:32,547
She's gone.

839
01:57:49,272 --> 01:57:52,525
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want."

840
01:57:52,692 --> 01:57:56,154
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures."

841
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:59,991
"Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of the death,

842
01:58:00,158 --> 01:58:04,162
"I will fear no evil,

843
01:58:04,328 --> 01:58:06,831
"for thou art with me."

844
01:58:19,427 --> 01:58:22,054
"Today I can shed light
on recent occurrences

845
01:58:22,221 --> 01:58:24,348
"from the attack that ended in this office..."

846
01:58:24,515 --> 01:58:27,143
Morning. "...to the phenomenon
that swept the Earth,

847
01:58:27,310 --> 01:58:29,229
"nearly annihilating our way of life."

848
01:58:29,395 --> 01:58:31,272
Do we like this word "annihilating"?

849
01:58:34,025 --> 01:58:36,027
Good morning.

850
01:58:38,029 --> 01:58:41,115
- Good morning, Mr President.
- Thank you.

851
01:58:47,705 --> 01:58:49,832
Mr President, we're live in five,

852
01:58:49,999 --> 01:58:52,001
four, three, two...

853
01:58:55,171 --> 01:59:01,552
My fellow Americans, in this time of
adversity we are being offered a moment.

854
01:59:01,719 --> 01:59:04,764
A moment to recognise
a growing threat in our own population

855
01:59:05,056 --> 01:59:09,018
and take a unique role
in the shape of human events.

856
01:59:14,524 --> 01:59:17,985
Did we just lose the feed? Are we still live?

857
01:59:52,270 --> 01:59:54,689
Good morning, Mr President.

858
01:59:56,899 --> 02:00:00,653
Please, don't be alarmed.
We're not going to harm anyone.

859
02:00:01,237 --> 02:00:03,447
Who are you people?

860
02:00:03,614 --> 02:00:06,450
We're mutants.
My name is Charles Xavier.

861
02:00:06,617 --> 02:00:09,287
- Please, sit down.
- I'd rather stand.

862
02:00:09,579 --> 02:00:11,163
Rogue.

863
02:00:12,290 --> 02:00:17,169
These files were taken from
the private offices of William Stryker.

864
02:00:26,429 --> 02:00:28,514
How did you get this?

865
02:00:28,681 --> 02:00:34,145
Let's just say I know a little girl
who can walk through walls.

866
02:00:42,445 --> 02:00:44,614
- I've never seen this.
- I know.

867
02:00:44,864 --> 02:00:47,491
So you also know
I don't respond to threats.

868
02:00:47,658 --> 02:00:50,494
This is not a threat. This is an opportunity.

869
02:00:50,661 --> 02:00:56,000
There are forces in this world, mutant and
human alike, who believe a war is coming.

870
02:00:57,585 --> 02:01:02,173
You will see from those files
that some have already tried to start one.

871
02:01:02,340 --> 02:01:07,637
And there have been casualties,
losses on both sides.

872
02:01:12,892 --> 02:01:15,186
Mr President.

873
02:01:16,604 --> 02:01:20,358
What you are about to tell the world is true.
This is a moment.

874
02:01:20,524 --> 02:01:27,156
A moment to repeat the mistakes of the
past, or to work together for a better future.

875
02:01:28,032 --> 02:01:30,534
We're here to stay, Mr President.

876
02:01:30,701 --> 02:01:32,745
The next move is yours.

877
02:01:33,871 --> 02:01:36,123
We'll be watching.

878
02:01:55,267 --> 02:01:57,144
Mr President?

879
02:02:24,255 --> 02:02:28,092
You know, even when Jean was a student,

880
02:02:28,259 --> 02:02:31,971
she was always hesitant about her powers.

881
02:02:32,138 --> 02:02:34,598
Always looking to others.

882
02:02:36,308 --> 02:02:41,897
Feeling that in some way
she was left behind.

883
02:02:49,113 --> 02:02:51,657
Could we have done more to save her?

884
02:02:53,117 --> 02:02:57,121
In the past, she may have let us.

885
02:02:58,039 --> 02:03:00,750
There had to be another way.

886
02:03:00,916 --> 02:03:03,294
Why did she leave the plane?

887
02:03:06,464 --> 02:03:09,550
Because she made a choice.

888
02:03:12,136 --> 02:03:14,555
Yes, come on in.

889
02:03:29,320 --> 02:03:30,988
Listen.

890
02:03:31,155 --> 02:03:33,157
She did make a choice.

891
02:03:35,326 --> 02:03:37,328
It was you.

892
02:04:10,361 --> 02:04:12,738
Professor?

893
02:04:12,905 --> 02:04:14,865
Is everything all right?

894
02:04:17,743 --> 02:04:20,496
Yes, I think it will be.

895
02:04:20,704 --> 02:04:27,253
Tell me, have any of you read a book
by an English novelist named TH White

896
02:04:27,419 --> 02:04:29,964
called The Once and Future King?

897
02:04:38,848 --> 02:04:42,643
Mutation: it is the key to our evolution.

898
02:04:42,810 --> 02:04:45,729
It is how we have evolved
from a single-celled organism

899
02:04:45,896 --> 02:04:48,858
into the dominant species on the planet.

900
02:04:49,024 --> 02:04:54,280
This process is slow, normally taking
thousands and thousands of years.

901
02:04:54,446 --> 02:05:00,286
But every few hundred millennia
evolution leaps forward.
