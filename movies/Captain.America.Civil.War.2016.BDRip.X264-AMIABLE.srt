www.rapidmoviez.com

2
00:01:10,353 --> 00:01:11,688
Longing

3
00:01:13,857 --> 00:01:14,857
Rusted

4
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,400
Seventeen

5
00:01:17,027 --> 00:01:18,027
Daybreak

6
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,238
Furnace

7
00:01:21,573 --> 00:01:22,573
Nine

8
00:01:23,074 --> 00:01:24,534
Benign

9
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,370
Homecoming

10
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:29,414
One

11
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,418
Freight car

12
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:42,052
Good morning, Soldier.

13
00:01:44,763 --> 00:01:45,847
Ready to comply.

14
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,600
I have a mission for you.

15
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,103
Sanction and extract.

16
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:54,314
No witnesses.

17
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:37,691
Well done Soldier.

18
00:03:21,443 --> 00:03:23,653
All right, what do you see?

19
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,822
Standard beat cops.

20
00:03:26,948 --> 00:03:28,533
Small station.

21
00:03:30,702 --> 00:03:31,828
Quiet street.

22
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:33,830
It's a good target.

23
00:03:33,997 --> 00:03:36,124
There's an ATM on the
south corner, which means?

24
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,334
Cameras.

25
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,169
Both cross streets are one-way.

26
00:03:39,336 --> 00:03:40,879
So, compromised escape routes.

27
00:03:41,671 --> 00:03:43,524
Means our guy doesn't
care about being seen.

28
00:03:43,548 --> 00:03:45,634
He isn't afraid
to make a mess on the way out.

29
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:47,767
You see that Range Rover
halfway up the block?

30
00:03:47,886 --> 00:03:49,763
Yeah, the red one? It's cute.

31
00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:51,032
It's also bulletproof,

32
00:03:51,056 --> 00:03:52,307
which means private security...

33
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,808
which means more guns...

34
00:03:54,142 --> 00:03:56,478
which means more headaches
for somebody. Probably us.

35
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:59,064
You guys know
I can move things with my mind, right?

36
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,942
Looking over your shoulder
needs to become second nature.

37
00:04:02,484 --> 00:04:04,861
Anybody ever tell you
you're a little paranoid?

38
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:07,238
Not to my face.
Why? Did you hear something?

39
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:08,531
Eyes on target, folks.

40
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,340
This is the best lead
we've had on Rumlow

41
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:11,802
in six months. I don't want to lose him.

42
00:04:11,826 --> 00:04:14,120
If he sees us coming,
that won't be a problem.

43
00:04:14,204 --> 00:04:15,538
He kind of hates us.

44
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:20,293
Sam...

45
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,878
see that garbage truck?

46
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:23,254
Tag it.

47
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:42,899
Give me X-ray.

48
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:49,739
That truck's loaded for max weight.

49
00:04:49,948 --> 00:04:50,948
And the driver's armed.

50
00:04:51,074 --> 00:04:52,075
It's a battering ram.

51
00:04:52,242 --> 00:04:53,243
- Go now.
- What?

52
00:04:54,452 --> 00:04:55,620
He's not hitting the police.

53
00:05:59,851 --> 00:06:01,770
Body Armour, AR-15s.

54
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:03,521
I make seven hostiles.

55
00:06:12,322 --> 00:06:13,698
I make five.

56
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,205
Sam.

57
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,834
Four.

58
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:30,757
Rumlow's on the third floor.

59
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,217
Wanda, just like we practiced.

60
00:06:32,383 --> 00:06:33,423
What about the gas?

61
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,552
Get it out.

62
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:53,571
Pack it up.

63
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:32,152
He's here.

64
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:37,407
Rumlow has a biological weapon.

65
00:07:37,574 --> 00:07:38,908
I'm on it.

66
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,945
I don't work like that no more.

67
00:08:19,115 --> 00:08:20,116
Fire in the hole.

68
00:08:25,622 --> 00:08:26,664
No!

69
00:08:49,604 --> 00:08:50,647
Sam.

70
00:08:50,855 --> 00:08:52,982
He's in an AFV heading north.

71
00:08:57,654 --> 00:08:59,656
Take this to the airstrip.

72
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:01,824
We're not gonna outrun them.
Lose the truck.

73
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,476
Where are you going to meet us?

74
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,001
I'm not.

75
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:25,056
I've got four, they're splitting up.

76
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,521
I got the two on the left.

77
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:41,239
They ditched their gear.

78
00:09:41,406 --> 00:09:43,406
It's a shell game now.
One of them has the payload.

79
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,124
There you are, you son of a bitch.

80
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,459
I've been waiting for this.

81
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:12,061
He doesn't have it.

82
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,521
I'm empty!

83
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:14,981
Out of the way!

84
00:10:54,437 --> 00:10:55,605
Drop it.

85
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,980
Or I'll drop this.

86
00:10:58,775 --> 00:11:00,568
- Drop it!
- He'll do it!

87
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,786
Payload secure. Thanks, Sam.

88
00:11:09,994 --> 00:11:10,994
Don't thank me.

89
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,705
I'm not thanking that thing.

90
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:13,956
His name is Redwing.

91
00:11:14,123 --> 00:11:15,291
I'm still not thanking it.

92
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,535
He's cute. Go ahead, pet him.

93
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:24,300
Come on!

94
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:34,602
This is for dropping
a building on my face.

95
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,913
Ahh!

96
00:11:56,874 --> 00:11:58,811
I think I look pretty good,
all things considered.

97
00:11:58,835 --> 00:11:59,835
Who's your buyer?

98
00:12:00,211 --> 00:12:02,004
You know, he knew you.

99
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:04,215
Your pal, your buddy, your BUCKY.

100
00:12:05,842 --> 00:12:06,842
What did you say?

101
00:12:06,968 --> 00:12:08,678
He remembered you.

102
00:12:09,178 --> 00:12:11,722
I was there. He got all weepy about it.

103
00:12:13,224 --> 00:12:15,017
Till they put his brain back in a blender.

104
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,687
He wanted you to know something.

105
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,813
He said to me...

106
00:12:19,355 --> 00:12:21,399
"Please tell Rogers.

107
00:12:22,024 --> 00:12:23,276
"When you gotta go...

108
00:12:23,484 --> 00:12:25,194
"you gotta go."

109
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,656
And you're coming with me.

110
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,300
Oh, my...

111
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:51,387
Sam...

112
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:54,515
we need Fire and Rescue

113
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:56,225
on the south side of the building.

114
00:12:56,767 --> 00:12:58,311
We gotta get up there.

115
00:13:05,193 --> 00:13:11,824
Try to remember the kind of September

116
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:15,661
When grass was green

117
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:19,081
Wake up, dear,
and say goodbye to your father.

118
00:13:19,248 --> 00:13:20,875
Who's the homeless person
on the couch?

119
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,420
This is why
I love coming home for Christmas...

120
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:25,838
right before you leave town.

121
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,257
Be nice, dear,
he's been studying abroad.

122
00:13:28,424 --> 00:13:30,259
Really? Which broad?
What's her name?

123
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:31,761
Candice.

124
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:33,346
Do me a favour?

125
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:35,073
Try not to burn
the house down before Monday.

126
00:13:35,097 --> 00:13:36,265
Okay, so it's Monday.

127
00:13:36,432 --> 00:13:37,600
That is good to know,

128
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,602
I will plan my toga party accordingly.

129
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:41,437
Where you going?

130
00:13:41,604 --> 00:13:42,688
Your father's flying us

131
00:13:42,772 --> 00:13:44,212
to the Bahamas for a little getaway.

132
00:13:44,273 --> 00:13:45,775
We might have to make a quick stop.

133
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,027
At the Pentagon. Right?

134
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,197
Don't worry, you're gonna love
the holiday menu at the commissary.

135
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,033
They say sarcasm
is a metric for potential.

136
00:13:54,116 --> 00:13:56,035
If that's true,
you'll be a great man someday.

137
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,537
I'll get the bags.

138
00:13:59,997 --> 00:14:02,375
He does miss you when you're not here.

139
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:07,463
And frankly, you're going to miss us.

140
00:14:08,172 --> 00:14:09,882
Because this is the last time

141
00:14:09,966 --> 00:14:11,551
we're all going to be together.

142
00:14:12,468 --> 00:14:14,845
You know what's about to happen.

143
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:16,806
Say something.

144
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,975
If you don't, you'll regret it.

145
00:14:22,645 --> 00:14:24,146
I love you, Dad.

146
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:27,567
And I know you did the best you could.

147
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,376
That's how I wish it happened.

148
00:14:47,837 --> 00:14:50,423
Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing...

149
00:14:50,506 --> 00:14:51,632
or BARF.

150
00:14:51,716 --> 00:14:53,509
God, I gotta work on that acronym.

151
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,970
An extremely costly method

152
00:14:56,053 --> 00:14:58,306
of hijacking the hippocampus...

153
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:02,518
to clear traumatic memories.

154
00:15:05,187 --> 00:15:06,272
Huh.

155
00:15:06,397 --> 00:15:07,607
It doesn't change the fact

156
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,525
that they never made it to the airport...

157
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:13,237
or all the things I did to avoid
processing my grief, but...

158
00:15:15,197 --> 00:15:19,535
Plus, $611 million for my
little therapeutic experiment?

159
00:15:21,537 --> 00:15:24,248
No one in their right mind
would've ever funded it.

160
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,085
Help me out,
what's the MIT mission statement?

161
00:15:28,252 --> 00:15:29,503
"To generate, disseminate...

162
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,381
"and preserve knowledge.

163
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,634
"And work with others...

164
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:37,553
"to bring it to bear on
the world's great challenges."

165
00:15:38,554 --> 00:15:41,307
Well, you are the others.

166
00:15:42,558 --> 00:15:43,893
And, quiet as it's kept...

167
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,645
the challenges facing you

168
00:15:45,728 --> 00:15:47,248
are the greatest mankind's ever known.

169
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:49,940
Plus, most of you are broke.

170
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:51,984
Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were.

171
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:53,402
As of this moment...

172
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:55,821
every student has been made
an equal recipient...

173
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:58,908
of the inaugural
September Foundation Grant.

174
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,493
As in...

175
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,496
all of your projects have
just been approved and funded.

176
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:09,335
No strings, no taxes...

177
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,671
just reframe the future!

178
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,506
Starting now.

179
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,350
Go break some eggs.

180
00:16:32,108 --> 00:16:33,818
Wow. Wow.

181
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:37,613
That took my breath away.

182
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,198
Oh, Tony! So generous.

183
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,534
So much money! Wow!

184
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:43,452
Out of curiosity...

185
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:46,414
will any portion of that grant
be made available to faculty?

186
00:16:46,497 --> 00:16:47,933
I know, "Ooh, gross," but hear me out.

187
00:16:47,957 --> 00:16:50,209
I have got this killer idea
for a self-cooking hotdog.

188
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:51,436
Basically,
chemical detonator embedded...

189
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,479
Restroom's this way, yeah?

190
00:16:52,503 --> 00:16:53,689
Yeah. Embedded in the meat shaft.

191
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:56,048
Mr Stark, I am so sorry
about the teleprompter.

192
00:16:56,132 --> 00:16:57,609
I didn't know Miss Potts had cancelled.

193
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:59,385
They didn't have time to fix it.

194
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:02,972
It's fine. I'll be right back.

195
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:04,473
We'll catch up later.

196
00:17:22,658 --> 00:17:25,494
That was nice,
what you did for those young people.

197
00:17:26,162 --> 00:17:27,663
Ah, they deserve it.

198
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,999
Plus, it helps ease my conscience.

199
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:35,171
They say there's a correlation
between generosity and guilt.

200
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,841
But if you've got the money...

201
00:17:39,717 --> 00:17:41,844
break as many eggs as you like.

202
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:43,971
Right?

203
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:53,730
Are you going up?

204
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,233
I'm right where I want to be.

205
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:58,110
Okay. Hey.

206
00:18:01,363 --> 00:18:04,074
Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.

207
00:18:04,366 --> 00:18:05,910
I work for the State Department.

208
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:08,370
Human Resources.

209
00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:10,623
I know it's boring...

210
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:14,210
but it enabled me to raise a son.

211
00:18:15,044 --> 00:18:17,963
I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.

212
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,551
His name was Charlie Spencer.

213
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:26,055
You murdered him.

214
00:18:27,723 --> 00:18:29,308
In Sokovia.

215
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:34,146
Not that that matters in the least to you.

216
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:37,942
You think you fight for us?

217
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,403
You just fight for yourself.

218
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:46,075
Who's going to avenge my son, Stark?

219
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,245
He's dead...

220
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,580
and I blame you.

221
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,399
11 Wakandans were

222
00:19:01,423 --> 00:19:03,551
among those killed
during a confrontation...

223
00:19:03,634 --> 00:19:05,845
between the Avengers
and a group of mercenaries...

224
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:07,972
in Lagos, Nigeria last month.

225
00:19:08,097 --> 00:19:09,574
The traditionally reclusive Wakandans

226
00:19:09,598 --> 00:19:10,891
were on an outreach mission...

227
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,726
in Lagos, when the attack occurred.

228
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:16,105
Our people's blood is spilled
on foreign soil...

229
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:19,942
not only because of
the actions of criminals...

230
00:19:20,109 --> 00:19:23,946
but by the indifference
of those pledged to stop them.

231
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,991
Victory at the expense of the innocent...

232
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:29,451
is no victory at all.

233
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,429
The Wakandan king went on to...

234
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:32,973
They are operating outside

235
00:19:32,997 --> 00:19:34,748
and above the international law.

236
00:19:34,832 --> 00:19:36,041
Because that's the reality,

237
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,710
if we don't respond to acts like these.

238
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:39,879
What legal authority does an enhanced

239
00:19:39,962 --> 00:19:41,714
individual like Wanda Maximoff have...

240
00:19:41,797 --> 00:19:43,132
to operate in Nigeri...?

241
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,971
It's my fault.

242
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:50,389
That's not true.

243
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:51,557
Turn the TV back on.

244
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,767
They're being very specific.

245
00:19:54,143 --> 00:19:57,396
I should've clocked that bomb vest
long before you had to deal with it.

246
00:19:58,647 --> 00:20:00,190
Rumlow said "BUCKY"...

247
00:20:01,692 --> 00:20:03,587
and all of a sudden
I was a 16-year-old kid again,

248
00:20:03,611 --> 00:20:04,653
in Brooklyn.

249
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,492
And people died.

250
00:20:12,536 --> 00:20:13,537
It's on me.

251
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,998
It's on both of us.

252
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,417
This job...

253
00:20:21,337 --> 00:20:23,255
We try to save
as many people as we can.

254
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,925
Sometimes that doesn't
mean everybody.

255
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,010
But if we can't find a way
to live with that...

256
00:20:28,177 --> 00:20:30,095
then next time...

257
00:20:31,388 --> 00:20:33,182
maybe nobody gets saved.

258
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,438
Vis! We talked about this.

259
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:42,232
Yes, but the door was open
so I assumed that...

260
00:20:43,984 --> 00:20:46,946
Captain Rogers wished to know
when Mr Stark was arriving.

261
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,572
Thank you. We'll be right down.

262
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,283
I'll use the door.

263
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,620
Oh, and apparently,
he's brought a guest.

264
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,497
We know who it is?

265
00:20:56,664 --> 00:20:58,499
The Secretary of State.

266
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,227
Five years ago...

267
00:21:03,712 --> 00:21:05,464
I had a heart attack...

268
00:21:05,756 --> 00:21:08,801
and dropped right in
the middle of my backswing.

269
00:21:09,593 --> 00:21:12,012
Turned out it was the best
round of my life...

270
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:14,306
because after 13 hours of surgery

271
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,183
and a triple bypass...

272
00:21:17,101 --> 00:21:20,854
I found something 40 years
in the Army had never taught me.

273
00:21:21,563 --> 00:21:22,731
Perspective.

274
00:21:24,942 --> 00:21:28,821
The world owes the Avengers
an unpayable debt.

275
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:32,574
You have fought for us...

276
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:35,869
protected us, risked your lives...

277
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:40,165
but while a great many people
see you as heroes...

278
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:42,251
there are some...

279
00:21:43,627 --> 00:21:45,587
who would prefer the word "vigilantes."

280
00:21:45,713 --> 00:21:48,007
What word would you use,
Mr Secretary?

281
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:49,383
How about "dangerous"?

282
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:52,845
What would you call
a group of US-based,

283
00:21:52,928 --> 00:21:55,055
enhanced individuals...

284
00:21:55,222 --> 00:21:58,183
who routinely ignore
sovereign borders...

285
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,979
and inflict their will
wherever they choose...

286
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:04,273
and who, frankly, seem unconcerned

287
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:05,607
about what they leave behind?

288
00:22:10,612 --> 00:22:12,197
New York.

289
00:22:26,003 --> 00:22:27,755
Washington, D.C.

290
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:37,347
Sokovia.

291
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,233
Lagos.

292
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,204
Okay. That's enough.

293
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:03,499
For the past four years,

294
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,060
you've operated with unlimited power...

295
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:06,835
and no supervision.

296
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:08,938
That's an arrangement
the governments of the world

297
00:23:08,962 --> 00:23:10,964
can no longer tolerate.

298
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:15,844
But I think we have a solution.

299
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:21,934
The Sokovia Accords.

300
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,229
Approved by 117 countries...

301
00:23:25,395 --> 00:23:28,273
it states that the Avengers

302
00:23:28,357 --> 00:23:30,818
shall no longer be a private organization.

303
00:23:31,026 --> 00:23:32,236
Instead...

304
00:23:32,486 --> 00:23:34,613
they'll operate under the supervision

305
00:23:34,696 --> 00:23:36,615
of a United Nations panel...

306
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:41,120
only when and if that panel
deems it necessary.

307
00:23:42,412 --> 00:23:45,290
The Avengers were formed to
make the world a safer place.

308
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,000
I feel we've done that.

309
00:23:47,376 --> 00:23:51,171
Tell me, Captain, do you know
where Thor and Banner are right now?

310
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,967
If I misplaced a couple of
30 megaton nukes...

311
00:23:55,259 --> 00:23:57,469
you can bet there'd be consequences.

312
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:02,182
Compromise. Reassurance.
That's how the world works.

313
00:24:02,432 --> 00:24:05,394
Believe me, this is the middle ground.

314
00:24:06,353 --> 00:24:08,939
So, there are contingencies.

315
00:24:09,398 --> 00:24:12,067
Three days from now,
the UN meets in Vienna...

316
00:24:12,234 --> 00:24:14,236
to ratify the Accords.

317
00:24:16,405 --> 00:24:17,990
Talk it over.

318
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,328
And if we come
to a decision you don't like?

319
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:26,874
Then you retire.

320
00:24:50,105 --> 00:24:51,106
Hello?

321
00:24:52,983 --> 00:24:55,068
Is this your car out front?

322
00:24:56,653 --> 00:24:58,447
I jumped the kerb.

323
00:25:00,073 --> 00:25:01,074
Maybe we could...

324
00:25:01,658 --> 00:25:03,202
take care of it ourselves.

325
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:05,412
If you wanna call the cops,
that's okay, too...

326
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:06,997
- I guess.
- No.

327
00:25:08,665 --> 00:25:10,459
No cops.

328
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:11,709
Thank you.

329
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:51,458
You have kept your looks, Colonel.

330
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:53,085
Congratulations.

331
00:25:57,172 --> 00:26:01,176
"Mission report. December 16, 1991."

332
00:26:01,343 --> 00:26:02,803
Who are you?

333
00:26:04,012 --> 00:26:05,847
My name is Zemo.

334
00:26:07,015 --> 00:26:09,226
I will repeat my question.

335
00:26:09,851 --> 00:26:14,731
Mission report, December 16, 1991.

336
00:26:14,898 --> 00:26:16,692
How did you find me?

337
00:26:16,858 --> 00:26:18,819
When S.H.I.E.L.D. fell...

338
00:26:18,986 --> 00:26:22,447
Black Widow released
HYDRA files to the public.

339
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:25,284
Millions of pages. Much of it encrypted.

340
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:27,077
Not easy to decipher.

341
00:26:30,414 --> 00:26:32,291
But, I have experience.

342
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:34,793
And patience.

343
00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:38,213
A man can do anything if he has those.

344
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:40,465
What do you want?

345
00:26:41,717 --> 00:26:43,593
Mission report.

346
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,595
December 16.

347
00:26:45,762 --> 00:26:47,180
1991.

348
00:26:47,931 --> 00:26:51,351
Go... to... hell!

349
00:27:05,532 --> 00:27:07,868
HYDRA deserves its place
on the ash heap.

350
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,954
So your death would not bother me.

351
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,540
But I'd have to use this book...

352
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:17,210
and other bloodier methods
to find what I need.

353
00:27:17,377 --> 00:27:19,588
I don't look forward to that.

354
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:23,383
You'd only be dying for...

355
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,926
your pride.

356
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:42,235
Hail HYDRA.

357
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,041
Secretary Ross has
a Congressional Medal of Honour...

358
00:27:56,124 --> 00:27:57,404
which is one more than you have.

359
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,211
So let's say we agree to this thing.

360
00:27:59,294 --> 00:28:01,129
How long is it gonna be
before they LoJack us

361
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:02,533
like a bunch of common criminals?

362
00:28:02,672 --> 00:28:04,716
117 countries want to sign this.

363
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,552
117, Sam, and you're just like,
"No, that's cool. We got it."

364
00:28:07,636 --> 00:28:08,780
How long are you going
to play both sides?

365
00:28:08,804 --> 00:28:09,971
I have an equation.

366
00:28:10,138 --> 00:28:12,015
Oh, this will clear it up.

367
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:14,142
In the eight years since Mr Stark

368
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:15,685
announced himself as Iron Man...

369
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:19,231
the number of known enhanced persons
has grown exponentially.

370
00:28:20,941 --> 00:28:22,234
During the same period...

371
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:24,528
the number of potentially
world-ending events

372
00:28:24,611 --> 00:28:26,154
has risen at a commensurate rate.

373
00:28:26,363 --> 00:28:27,614
Are you saying it's our fault?

374
00:28:28,031 --> 00:28:30,492
I'm saying there may be a causality.

375
00:28:32,494 --> 00:28:35,247
Our very strength invites challenge.

376
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,958
Challenge incites conflict.

377
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:39,918
And conflict...

378
00:28:41,461 --> 00:28:43,713
breeds catastrophe.

379
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:45,257
Oversight...

380
00:28:47,676 --> 00:28:50,595
Oversight is not an idea that
can be dismissed out of hand.

381
00:28:50,846 --> 00:28:51,847
Boom.

382
00:28:52,722 --> 00:28:53,932
Tony.

383
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:56,726
You are being uncharacteristically
non-hyperverbal.

384
00:28:56,893 --> 00:28:58,246
It's because he's already
made up his mind.

385
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,147
Boy, you know me so well.

386
00:29:01,148 --> 00:29:03,650
Actually, I'm nursing
an electromagnetic headache.

387
00:29:04,526 --> 00:29:07,320
That's what's going on, Cap.
It's just pain.

388
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:09,990
It's discomfort.

389
00:29:10,073 --> 00:29:12,075
Who's putting coffee grounds
in the disposal?

390
00:29:12,909 --> 00:29:15,537
Am I running a bed and breakfast
for a biker gang?

391
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,420
Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way.

392
00:29:23,503 --> 00:29:24,921
He's a great kid.

393
00:29:25,172 --> 00:29:28,467
Computer engineering degree,
3.6 GPA...

394
00:29:28,675 --> 00:29:31,219
had a floor-level gig
at Intel planned for the fall.

395
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,805
But first, he wanted to put
a few miles on his soul...

396
00:29:34,181 --> 00:29:36,683
before he parked it
behind a desk. See the world.

397
00:29:36,892 --> 00:29:38,351
Maybe be of service.

398
00:29:39,102 --> 00:29:40,580
Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or

399
00:29:40,604 --> 00:29:42,123
Fort Lauderdale,
which is what I would do.

400
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:44,858
He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam,
which sounds fun.

401
00:29:45,025 --> 00:29:46,985
He decided to spend his summer

402
00:29:47,068 --> 00:29:48,629
building sustainable housing
for the poor.

403
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:50,155
Guess where. Sokovia.

404
00:29:54,034 --> 00:29:55,511
He wanted to make
a difference, I suppose.

405
00:29:55,535 --> 00:29:56,828
We won't know because we dropped

406
00:29:56,912 --> 00:29:59,039
a building on him
while we were kicking ass.

407
00:30:07,422 --> 00:30:09,925
There's no decision-making
process here.

408
00:30:11,635 --> 00:30:12,802
We need to be put in check!

409
00:30:13,094 --> 00:30:15,472
Whatever form that takes, I'm game.

410
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:16,741
If we can't accept limitations,

411
00:30:16,765 --> 00:30:17,807
if we're boundary-less...

412
00:30:17,891 --> 00:30:20,018
we're no better than the bad guys.

413
00:30:20,101 --> 00:30:22,604
Tony, someone dies on your watch,
you don't give up.

414
00:30:22,896 --> 00:30:23,563
Who said we're giving up?

415
00:30:23,647 --> 00:30:26,233
We are if we're not
taking responsibility for our actions.

416
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,193
This document just shifts the blame.

417
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,028
I'm sorry, Steve.

418
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:31,780
That is dangerously arrogant.

419
00:30:32,072 --> 00:30:34,074
This is the United Nations
we're talking about.

420
00:30:34,157 --> 00:30:36,451
It's not the World Security Council,

421
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:37,929
it's not S.H.I.E.L.D., it's not HYDRA.

422
00:30:37,953 --> 00:30:39,246
No, but it's run by people

423
00:30:39,329 --> 00:30:40,705
with agendas, and agendas change.

424
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:42,707
That's good. That's why I'm here.

425
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:45,436
When I realised what my weapons
were capable of in the wrong hands...

426
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,060
I shut it down
and stopped manufacturing.

427
00:30:47,295 --> 00:30:49,548
Tony, you chose to do that.

428
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:52,551
If we sign this, we surrender
our right to choose.

429
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:56,030
What if this panel sends us somewhere
we don't think we should go?

430
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:57,448
What if there is somewhere
we need to go

431
00:30:57,472 --> 00:30:58,473
and they don't let us?

432
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,225
We may not be perfect,

433
00:31:00,308 --> 00:31:02,018
but the safest hands are still our own.

434
00:31:02,185 --> 00:31:04,604
If we don't do this now,

435
00:31:04,688 --> 00:31:06,356
it's gonna be done to us later.

436
00:31:06,523 --> 00:31:08,441
That's the fact. That won't be pretty.

437
00:31:08,608 --> 00:31:09,835
You're saying they'll come for me.

438
00:31:09,859 --> 00:31:11,236
We would protect you.

439
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:13,113
Maybe Tony's right.

440
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:16,783
If we have one hand on the wheel,

441
00:31:16,866 --> 00:31:18,952
we can still steer. If we take it off...

442
00:31:19,035 --> 00:31:20,805
Aren't you the same woman
who told the government

443
00:31:20,829 --> 00:31:22,289
to kiss her ass a few years ago?

444
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:24,749
I'm just reading the terrain.

445
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:28,211
We have made some
very public mistakes.

446
00:31:28,378 --> 00:31:30,422
We need to win their trust back.

447
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:32,716
Focus up. I'm sorry.
Did I just mishear you...

448
00:31:32,882 --> 00:31:34,986
- or did you agree with me?
- I want to take it back now.

449
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,010
No, you can't retract it.

450
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:37,095
Thank you. Unprecedented.

451
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:41,474
Okay. Case closed. I win.

452
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:44,019
I have to go.

453
00:32:26,227 --> 00:32:29,773
And now, I would like
to invite Sharon Carter

454
00:32:29,856 --> 00:32:31,441
to come up and say a few words.

455
00:32:45,121 --> 00:32:48,333
Margaret Carter was known to most
as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D...

456
00:32:49,292 --> 00:32:51,378
but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.

457
00:32:53,755 --> 00:32:55,590
She had a photograph in her office.

458
00:32:55,882 --> 00:32:58,885
Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK.

459
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,596
As a kid, that was pretty cool.

460
00:33:01,888 --> 00:33:04,265
But it was a lot to live up to.

461
00:33:04,474 --> 00:33:06,768
Which is why I never told
anyone we were related.

462
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:10,313
I asked her once how she managed

463
00:33:10,397 --> 00:33:12,273
to master diplomacy and espionage...

464
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,778
in a time when no one wanted to see
a woman succeed at either.

465
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:19,114
She said, compromise where you can.

466
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:23,243
But where you can't, don't.

467
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:29,666
Even if everyone is telling you
that something wrong is something right.

468
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:33,086
Even if the whole world
is telling you to move...

469
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:36,881
it is your duty to plant
yourself like a tree...

470
00:33:37,132 --> 00:33:41,553
look them in the eye and say
"No, you move."

471
00:33:53,273 --> 00:33:55,400
When I came out of the ice,

472
00:33:55,483 --> 00:33:57,861
I thought everyone
I had known was gone.

473
00:33:58,611 --> 00:34:00,739
Then I found out she was alive.

474
00:34:01,781 --> 00:34:03,324
I was just lucky to have her.

475
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,285
She had you back, too.

476
00:34:07,871 --> 00:34:09,205
Who else signed?

477
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:12,876
Tony, Rhodey, Vision.

478
00:34:13,793 --> 00:34:14,794
Clint?

479
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:17,172
Says he's retired.

480
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,174
- Wanda?
- TBD.

481
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,511
I'm off to Vienna
for the signing of the Accords.

482
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:25,305
There's plenty of room on the jet.

483
00:34:29,184 --> 00:34:32,020
Just because it's the path
of least resistance...

484
00:34:32,187 --> 00:34:34,397
doesn't mean it's the wrong path.

485
00:34:34,647 --> 00:34:37,442
Staying together is more important
than how we stay together.

486
00:34:38,318 --> 00:34:40,445
What are we giving up to do it?

487
00:34:44,657 --> 00:34:45,909
I'm sorry, Nat.

488
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,827
I can't sign it.

489
00:34:49,245 --> 00:34:50,246
I know.

490
00:34:52,665 --> 00:34:54,083
Then what are you doing here?

491
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,214
I didn't want you to be alone.

492
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,180
Come here.

493
00:35:12,727 --> 00:35:15,647
At a special
United Nations conference...

494
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:18,274
117 countries have come together

495
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:21,069
to ratify the Sokovia Accords.

496
00:35:25,073 --> 00:35:26,533
Excuse me, Ms Romanoff?

497
00:35:26,616 --> 00:35:28,336
- Yes?
- These need your signature.

498
00:35:29,911 --> 00:35:31,246
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

499
00:35:32,372 --> 00:35:35,750
I suppose neither of us
is used to the spotlight.

500
00:35:37,126 --> 00:35:39,087
Oh, well, it's not always so flattering.

501
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:41,589
You seem to be doing all right so far.

502
00:35:42,131 --> 00:35:44,092
Considering your last trip
to Capitol Hill...

503
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:48,179
I wouldn't think you'd be particularly
comfortable in this company.

504
00:35:48,263 --> 00:35:49,389
Well, I'm not.

505
00:35:49,472 --> 00:35:52,308
And that alone makes me glad
you are here, Ms Romanoff.

506
00:35:52,475 --> 00:35:54,269
Why? You don't approve of all this?

507
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:57,689
The Accords, yes.
The politics, not really.

508
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:01,609
Two people in a room can get
more done than a hundred.

509
00:36:01,776 --> 00:36:04,112
Unless you need to move a piano.

510
00:36:06,656 --> 00:36:07,699
Ms Romanoff.

511
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:08,908
King T'Chaka.

512
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,854
Please, allow me to apologise
for what happened in Nigeria.

513
00:36:11,953 --> 00:36:13,496
Thank you.

514
00:36:13,663 --> 00:36:15,874
Thank you for agreeing to all of this.

515
00:36:16,165 --> 00:36:19,294
I'm sad to hear that Captain Rogers
will not be joining us today.

516
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:20,753
Yes, so am I.

517
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,439
If everyone could please be seated.

518
00:36:22,463 --> 00:36:24,215
This assembly is now in session.

519
00:36:25,133 --> 00:36:26,301
That is the future calling.

520
00:36:28,136 --> 00:36:29,262
Such a pleasure.

521
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,638
Thank you.

522
00:36:31,973 --> 00:36:35,685
For a man
who disapproves of diplomacy,

523
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:38,313
you're getting quite good at it.

524
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:40,481
I'm happy, Father.

525
00:36:45,486 --> 00:36:46,486
Thank you.

526
00:36:47,196 --> 00:36:48,196
Thank you.

527
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:51,326
When stolen Wakandan vibranium

528
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:54,329
was used to make a terrible weapon...

529
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:58,374
we in Wakanda were forced
to question our legacy.

530
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:01,294
Those men and women
killed in Nigeria...

531
00:37:01,461 --> 00:37:03,379
were part of a goodwill mission

532
00:37:03,463 --> 00:37:05,590
from a country too long in the shadows.

533
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:11,012
We will not, however,
let misfortune drive us back.

534
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:14,807
We will fight to improve
the world we wish to join.

535
00:37:15,308 --> 00:37:19,062
I am grateful to the Avengers
for supporting this initiative.

536
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,316
Wakanda is proud

537
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:25,318
to extend its hand in peace.

538
00:37:25,485 --> 00:37:26,486
Everybody get down!

539
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:04,399
My mom tried to
talk me out of enlisting...

540
00:38:04,565 --> 00:38:05,984
but, um, not Aunt Peggy.

541
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,152
She bought me my first thigh holster.

542
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:10,196
Very practical.

543
00:38:10,363 --> 00:38:11,739
And stylish.

544
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,747
CIA has you stationed over here now?

545
00:38:19,914 --> 00:38:21,582
Berlin. Joint Terrorism Task Force.

546
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:23,918
Right. Right. Sounds fun.

547
00:38:24,585 --> 00:38:26,045
I know, right?

548
00:38:28,756 --> 00:38:31,092
I've been meaning to ask you.

549
00:38:31,259 --> 00:38:34,178
When you were spying on me
from across the hall...

550
00:38:34,429 --> 00:38:35,749
You mean when I was doing my job.

551
00:38:38,641 --> 00:38:39,851
Did Peggy know?

552
00:38:42,437 --> 00:38:44,397
She kept so many secrets.

553
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:46,607
I didn't want her to have one from you.

554
00:38:51,154 --> 00:38:52,488
Thanks for walking me back.

555
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,240
Sure.

556
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:58,870
Steve.

557
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,747
There's something you gotta see.

558
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,933
A bomb hidden in a news van...

559
00:39:02,957 --> 00:39:04,037
Who's coordinating?

560
00:39:04,083 --> 00:39:05,102
Ripped through
the UN building in Vienna.

561
00:39:05,126 --> 00:39:06,270
Good. They're solid. Forensics?

562
00:39:06,294 --> 00:39:07,438
More than 70 people have been injured.

563
00:39:07,462 --> 00:39:11,257
At least 12 are dead,
including Wakanda's King T'Chaka.

564
00:39:11,424 --> 00:39:13,264
Officials have released
a video of a suspect...

565
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:15,803
who they have identified
as James Buchanan Barnes...

566
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:17,388
the Winter Soldier.

567
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:18,973
The infamous HYDRA agent...

568
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:22,143
linked to numerous acts of terrorism
and political assassinations.

569
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,811
I have to go to work.

570
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:32,779
Call MI6, see if we can get
Micro Forensics to hurry this up.

571
00:39:32,945 --> 00:39:34,214
We need the whole team
here in two hours

572
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:35,323
or it's not worth it.

573
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:46,751
I'm very sorry.

574
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,134
In my culture...

575
00:39:55,343 --> 00:39:58,179
death is not the end.

576
00:40:00,014 --> 00:40:03,059
It's more of a stepping-off point.

577
00:40:04,227 --> 00:40:05,728
You reach out with both hands...

578
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,272
and Bast and Sekhmet,

579
00:40:08,356 --> 00:40:10,942
they lead you into the green veldt...

580
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:13,903
where you can run forever.

581
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,447
That sounds very peaceful.

582
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:20,034
My father thought so.

583
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:24,038
I am not my father.

584
00:40:24,163 --> 00:40:25,373
T'CHALLA...

585
00:40:25,873 --> 00:40:28,376
Task Force will decide
who brings in Barnes.

586
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:32,755
Don't bother, Ms Romanoff.

587
00:40:33,714 --> 00:40:35,299
I'll kill him myself.

588
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:42,974
Yeah?

589
00:40:43,057 --> 00:40:44,308
You all right?

590
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:47,061
Uh, yeah, thanks. I got lucky.

591
00:40:53,067 --> 00:40:56,654
I know how much Barnes
means to you. I really do.

592
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:00,658
Stay home. You'll only make this worse.

593
00:41:00,908 --> 00:41:02,243
For all of us.

594
00:41:02,535 --> 00:41:03,578
Please.

595
00:41:03,703 --> 00:41:04,888
Are you saying you'll arrest me?

596
00:41:04,912 --> 00:41:06,414
No.

597
00:41:07,373 --> 00:41:08,416
Someone will.

598
00:41:08,583 --> 00:41:10,793
If you interfere.
That's how it works now.

599
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:14,088
If he's this far gone, Nat,
I should be the one to bring him in.

600
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:15,423
Why?

601
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,925
Because I'm the one
least likely to die trying.

602
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:21,011
Shit.

603
00:41:25,433 --> 00:41:27,268
She tell you to stay out of it?

604
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,021
Might have a point.

605
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:31,314
He'd do it for me.

606
00:41:31,564 --> 00:41:32,982
1945, maybe.

607
00:41:33,107 --> 00:41:35,860
I just want to make sure
we consider all our options.

608
00:41:36,152 --> 00:41:37,528
The people that shoot at you

609
00:41:37,737 --> 00:41:39,113
usually wind up shooting at me.

610
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,285
Tips have been pouring in
since that footage went public.

611
00:41:44,493 --> 00:41:46,613
Everybody thinks
the Winter Soldier goes to their gym.

612
00:41:46,954 --> 00:41:48,456
Most of it's noise.

613
00:41:48,664 --> 00:41:49,957
Except for this.

614
00:41:51,959 --> 00:41:54,295
My boss expects a briefing,
pretty much now...

615
00:41:54,462 --> 00:41:56,631
so that's all the head start
you're gonna get.

616
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:57,798
Thank you.

617
00:41:57,882 --> 00:41:59,634
You're gonna have to hurry.

618
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:02,261
We have orders to shoot on sight.

619
00:42:08,476 --> 00:42:11,354
Homecoming

620
00:42:13,022 --> 00:42:14,106
One

621
00:42:14,649 --> 00:42:15,649
One

622
00:42:20,696 --> 00:42:22,823
Freight car

623
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:36,003
I have your breakfast.

624
00:42:39,715 --> 00:42:41,842
I could smell it before I opened the door.

625
00:42:42,051 --> 00:42:43,886
Side of bacon and black coffee.

626
00:42:44,053 --> 00:42:44,553
Again.

627
00:42:45,012 --> 00:42:47,098
I can make you something
different, if you like.

628
00:42:47,223 --> 00:42:47,974
This is wonderful...

629
00:42:48,182 --> 00:42:49,422
I will just put this on your...

630
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,435
It's okay, I can manage!

631
00:44:24,779 --> 00:44:25,922
Heads up, Cap.

632
00:44:25,946 --> 00:44:28,282
German Special Forces,
approaching from the south.

633
00:44:29,075 --> 00:44:30,284
Understood.

634
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:40,043
Do you know me?

635
00:44:42,922 --> 00:44:44,590
You're Steve.

636
00:44:45,466 --> 00:44:47,718
I read about you in a museum.

637
00:44:48,302 --> 00:44:50,054
They've set the perimeter.

638
00:44:51,097 --> 00:44:52,640
I know you're nervous,

639
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:54,183
and you have plenty of reason to be.

640
00:44:56,143 --> 00:44:57,520
But you're lying.

641
00:44:58,771 --> 00:45:00,773
I wasn't in Vienna.
I don't do that any more.

642
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,140
They're entering the building.

643
00:45:02,191 --> 00:45:04,777
Well, the people
who think you did are coming here now.

644
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:06,695
And they're not planning
on taking you alive.

645
00:45:06,821 --> 00:45:08,322
That's smart.

646
00:45:08,406 --> 00:45:09,615
Good strategy.

647
00:45:11,283 --> 00:45:12,763
They're on the roof. I'm compromised.

648
00:45:15,871 --> 00:45:17,551
This doesn't have to end in a fight, Buck.

649
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:24,672
- It always ends in a fight.
- Five seconds.

650
00:45:25,673 --> 00:45:27,216
You pulled me from the river.

651
00:45:27,842 --> 00:45:28,842
Why?

652
00:45:29,844 --> 00:45:31,429
- I don't know.
- Three seconds.

653
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:33,180
Yes, you do.

654
00:45:34,682 --> 00:45:35,766
Breach! Breach! Breach!

655
00:45:56,328 --> 00:45:57,328
Buck, stop!

656
00:45:57,955 --> 00:45:59,039
You're gonna kill someone.

657
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:03,085
I'm not gonna kill anyone.

658
00:46:49,423 --> 00:46:50,966
Suspect has broken containment!

659
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,860
He's headed down the east stairwell!

660
00:47:03,562 --> 00:47:04,562
Come on, man.

661
00:47:26,585 --> 00:47:27,586
Ahhh!

662
00:48:09,587 --> 00:48:11,005
Sam, southwest rooftop.

663
00:48:11,171 --> 00:48:12,524
Who the hell's the other guy?

664
00:48:12,548 --> 00:48:13,799
About to find out.

665
00:48:26,478 --> 00:48:28,272
- Sam.
- Got him.

666
00:49:09,897 --> 00:49:11,273
Stand down!

667
00:49:13,901 --> 00:49:14,902
Stand down!

668
00:49:43,931 --> 00:49:45,432
Sam, I can't shake this guy.

669
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:46,767
Right behind you.

670
00:51:21,862 --> 00:51:23,906
Stand down, now.

671
00:51:31,038 --> 00:51:32,748
Congratulations, Cap.

672
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,666
You're a criminal.

673
00:51:57,397 --> 00:51:58,607
Your Highness.

674
00:52:04,822 --> 00:52:07,032
"A pinch of paprika."

675
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:08,158
A pinch.

676
00:52:11,954 --> 00:52:13,831
Is that paprikash?

677
00:52:13,956 --> 00:52:17,251
I thought it might lift your spirits.

678
00:52:30,764 --> 00:52:32,766
Spirits lifted.

679
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:36,270
In my defense,

680
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:39,189
I haven't actually ever eaten
anything before, so...

681
00:52:39,314 --> 00:52:40,524
May I?

682
00:52:40,607 --> 00:52:41,607
Please.

683
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:49,950
- Wanda?
- Hmm.

684
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:52,077
No one dislikes you, Wanda.

685
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:55,538
Thanks.

686
00:52:55,622 --> 00:52:56,665
Oh, you're welcome.

687
00:52:56,874 --> 00:53:00,210
No, it's a involuntary response
in their amygdala.

688
00:53:00,294 --> 00:53:02,421
They can't help but be afraid of you.

689
00:53:02,588 --> 00:53:03,588
Are you?

690
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:05,424
My amygdala is synthetic, so...

691
00:53:09,136 --> 00:53:12,306
I used to think of myself one way.

692
00:53:13,974 --> 00:53:15,893
But after this...

693
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:18,478
I am something else.

694
00:53:18,645 --> 00:53:22,149
I'm still me, I think, but...

695
00:53:24,276 --> 00:53:26,945
that's not what everyone else sees.

696
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:32,034
Do you know, I don't know what this is?

697
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,161
Not really.

698
00:53:34,661 --> 00:53:36,413
I know it's not of this world...

699
00:53:36,622 --> 00:53:37,998
that it powered Loki's staff,

700
00:53:38,123 --> 00:53:40,334
gave you your abilities, but...

701
00:53:41,793 --> 00:53:45,005
its true nature is a mystery.

702
00:53:45,297 --> 00:53:47,174
And yet, it is part of me.

703
00:53:47,382 --> 00:53:48,508
Are you afraid of it?

704
00:53:49,343 --> 00:53:51,678
I wish to understand it.

705
00:53:51,845 --> 00:53:54,014
The more I do, the less it controls me.

706
00:53:54,181 --> 00:53:57,100
One day... who knows?

707
00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:58,518
I may even control it.

708
00:54:01,229 --> 00:54:05,067
I don't know what's in this
but it is not paprika.

709
00:54:05,859 --> 00:54:07,945
I'm gonna go to the store.

710
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:10,572
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

711
00:54:10,781 --> 00:54:13,867
Alternatively, we could order a pizza?

712
00:54:15,035 --> 00:54:17,913
Vision, are you not letting me leave?

713
00:54:19,581 --> 00:54:21,375
It is a question of safety.

714
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:23,460
I can protect myself.

715
00:54:24,878 --> 00:54:26,296
Not yours.

716
00:54:27,923 --> 00:54:30,550
Mr Stark would like to
avoid the possibility

717
00:54:30,717 --> 00:54:32,511
of another public incident.

718
00:54:32,886 --> 00:54:36,932
Until the Accords are on
a more secure foundation.

719
00:54:39,518 --> 00:54:41,561
And what do you want?

720
00:54:42,688 --> 00:54:44,189
For people to see you...

721
00:54:45,065 --> 00:54:46,566
as I do.

722
00:55:19,725 --> 00:55:20,726
So, you like cats?

723
00:55:20,892 --> 00:55:22,561
- Sam.
- What?

724
00:55:22,853 --> 00:55:25,313
Dude shows up dressed like a cat,
you don't wanna know more?

725
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:29,276
Your suit... it's vibranium?

726
00:55:32,946 --> 00:55:35,157
The Black Panther
has been the protector

727
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,159
of Wakanda for generations.

728
00:55:38,243 --> 00:55:41,538
A mantle, passed from warrior to warrior.

729
00:55:43,081 --> 00:55:45,834
And now, because your friend
murdered my father...

730
00:55:46,626 --> 00:55:49,296
I also wear the mantle of king.

731
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:51,590
So, I ask you...

732
00:55:51,673 --> 00:55:54,676
as both warrior and king...

733
00:55:55,886 --> 00:55:59,639
how long do you think you can
keep your friend safe from me?

734
00:56:19,451 --> 00:56:20,744
What's gonna happen to him?

735
00:56:20,911 --> 00:56:23,121
Same thing that ought to happen to you.

736
00:56:23,205 --> 00:56:25,415
Psychological evaluation
and extradition.

737
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:27,542
This is Everett Ross,
Deputy Task Force Commander.

738
00:56:28,001 --> 00:56:29,002
What about a lawyer?

739
00:56:29,169 --> 00:56:30,837
Lawyer. That's funny.

740
00:56:31,171 --> 00:56:33,131
See their weapons are placed in lockup.

741
00:56:33,298 --> 00:56:35,175
We'll write you a receipt.

742
00:56:35,342 --> 00:56:38,678
I better not look out the window
and see anybody flying around in that.

743
00:56:44,726 --> 00:56:46,366
You'll be
provided with an office

744
00:56:46,394 --> 00:56:47,771
instead of a cell.

745
00:56:47,854 --> 00:56:49,773
Now, do me a favour, stay in it?

746
00:56:50,524 --> 00:56:52,484
I don't intend on going anywhere.

747
00:56:52,651 --> 00:56:56,279
For the record, this is what
making things worse looks like.

748
00:56:56,571 --> 00:56:57,697
He's alive.

749
00:56:58,031 --> 00:56:59,574
No.

750
00:56:59,825 --> 00:57:02,035
Romania was not Accords-sanctioned.

751
00:57:02,202 --> 00:57:03,829
Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup.

752
00:57:03,995 --> 00:57:05,914
Try not to break anything
while we fix this.

753
00:57:06,081 --> 00:57:08,458
Consequences? You bet
there'll be consequences.

754
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:10,252
Obviously you can quote me on that,

755
00:57:10,335 --> 00:57:11,854
because I just said it. Anything else?

756
00:57:11,878 --> 00:57:12,921
Thank you, sir.

757
00:57:14,172 --> 00:57:15,465
"Consequences"?

758
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:17,068
Secretary Ross
wants you both prosecuted.

759
00:57:17,092 --> 00:57:18,385
Had to give him something.

760
00:57:18,552 --> 00:57:20,112
I'm not getting that shield back, am I?

761
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:21,781
Technically, it's the
government's property.

762
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:22,848
Wings, too.

763
00:57:23,014 --> 00:57:24,224
That's cold.

764
00:57:24,558 --> 00:57:25,809
Warmer than jail.

765
00:57:53,545 --> 00:57:55,630
Hey, you wanna see
something cool?

766
00:57:56,423 --> 00:57:58,592
I pulled something from Dad's archives.

767
00:58:00,051 --> 00:58:01,428
Felt timely.

768
00:58:05,432 --> 00:58:09,019
FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill
with these in 1941.

769
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:12,606
Provided support to the Allies
when they needed it most.

770
00:58:12,772 --> 00:58:14,812
Some would say it brought
our country closer to war.

771
00:58:16,484 --> 00:58:18,904
See? If not for these,
you wouldn't be here.

772
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:23,033
I'm trying to... What do you call it?

773
00:58:23,325 --> 00:58:25,285
That's an olive branch.

774
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:27,621
Is that what you call it?

775
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:31,499
Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.

776
00:58:32,751 --> 00:58:35,045
We're kinda...

777
00:58:35,629 --> 00:58:37,297
- Well, not kinda...
- Pregnant?

778
00:58:37,756 --> 00:58:39,257
No. Definitely not.

779
00:58:39,424 --> 00:58:41,218
We're taking a break.

780
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:42,594
It's nobody's fault.

781
00:58:44,179 --> 00:58:45,639
I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.

782
00:58:46,431 --> 00:58:49,392
A few years ago, I almost lost her,
so I trashed all my suits.

783
00:58:50,518 --> 00:58:52,395
Then, we had to mop up HYDRA...

784
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:54,898
and then Ultron. My fault.

785
00:58:55,065 --> 00:58:58,276
And then, and then, and then,
I never stopped.

786
00:58:58,443 --> 00:59:00,820
Because the truth is I don't wanna stop.

787
00:59:02,197 --> 00:59:04,241
I don't wanna lose her.

788
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:07,035
I thought maybe the Accords
could split the difference.

789
00:59:10,664 --> 00:59:12,832
In her defense, I'm a handful.

790
00:59:14,042 --> 00:59:16,503
Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass,

791
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:18,380
but he and Mom always made it work.

792
00:59:18,546 --> 00:59:20,006
I'm glad Howard got married.

793
00:59:20,715 --> 00:59:22,676
I only knew him
when he was young and single.

794
00:59:22,842 --> 00:59:24,761
Oh, really? You two knew each other?

795
00:59:24,844 --> 00:59:26,221
He never mentioned that.

796
00:59:26,388 --> 00:59:29,015
Maybe only a thousand times.

797
00:59:29,641 --> 00:59:31,017
God, I hated you.

798
00:59:33,019 --> 00:59:34,646
I don't mean to make things difficult.

799
00:59:34,813 --> 00:59:37,107
I know, because you're
a very polite person.

800
00:59:37,732 --> 00:59:40,026
If I see a situation pointed south...

801
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:42,362
I can't ignore it.

802
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:43,822
Sometimes I wish I could.

803
00:59:43,989 --> 00:59:45,031
No, you don't.

804
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:49,661
No, I don't.

805
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:51,371
Sometimes...

806
00:59:51,538 --> 00:59:54,582
Sometimes I wanna
punch you in your perfect teeth.

807
00:59:55,166 --> 00:59:56,626
But I don't wanna see you gone.

808
00:59:57,377 --> 00:59:58,878
We need you, Cap.

809
00:59:59,587 --> 01:00:03,049
So far, nothing's happened
that can't be undone, if you sign.

810
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:05,343
We can make the last 24 hours legit.

811
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:07,721
Barnes gets transferred to
an American psych-centre...

812
01:00:07,887 --> 01:00:09,848
instead of a Wakandan prison.

813
01:00:21,693 --> 01:00:23,028
I'm not saying it's impossible...

814
01:00:23,236 --> 01:00:25,238
but there would have to be safeguards.

815
01:00:25,405 --> 01:00:26,448
Sure.

816
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:28,325
Once we put out the PR fire,

817
01:00:28,408 --> 01:00:30,410
those documents can be amended.

818
01:00:30,577 --> 01:00:32,471
I'd file a motion to have
you and Wanda reinstated...

819
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:34,331
Wanda? What about Wanda?

820
01:00:34,622 --> 01:00:36,309
She's fine. She's confined
to the compound, currently.

821
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:37,542
Vision's keeping her company.

822
01:00:37,709 --> 01:00:38,709
Oh, God, Tony.

823
01:00:38,877 --> 01:00:41,212
Every time I think you see
things the right way...

824
01:00:41,379 --> 01:00:42,440
It's 100 acres with a lap pool.

825
01:00:42,464 --> 01:00:43,506
It's got a screening room.

826
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:44,817
There's worse ways to protect people.

827
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:45,884
Protection?

828
01:00:46,593 --> 01:00:47,677
Is that how you see this?

829
01:00:47,761 --> 01:00:49,804
This is protection? It's internment, Tony.

830
01:00:49,971 --> 01:00:51,365
- She's not a US citizen.
- Oh, come on, Tony.

831
01:00:51,389 --> 01:00:52,950
And they don't grant visas
to weapons of mass destruction.

832
01:00:52,974 --> 01:00:53,975
She's a kid!

833
01:00:54,059 --> 01:00:55,435
Give me a break!

834
01:00:56,644 --> 01:00:58,688
I'm doing what has to be done.

835
01:00:58,855 --> 01:01:00,648
To stave off something worse.

836
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:05,570
You keep telling yourself that.

837
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:09,991
Hate to break up the set.

838
01:01:17,457 --> 01:01:19,334
Hello, Mr Barnes.

839
01:01:20,001 --> 01:01:22,379
I've been sent by
the United Nations to evaluate you.

840
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:24,756
Do you mind if I sit?

841
01:01:29,677 --> 01:01:31,388
Your first name is James?

842
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:34,808
The receipt for your gear.

843
01:01:36,643 --> 01:01:38,311
"Bird costume"? Come on.

844
01:01:38,478 --> 01:01:40,188
I didn't write it.

845
01:01:46,194 --> 01:01:47,779
I'm not here to judge you.

846
01:01:48,238 --> 01:01:49,798
I just want to ask you a few questions.

847
01:01:51,491 --> 01:01:53,743
Do you know where you are, James?

848
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:59,624
I can't help you if you
don't talk to me, James.

849
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:02,210
My name is BUCKY.

850
01:02:11,177 --> 01:02:12,679
Hello?

851
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:20,854
Hey!

852
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:44,043
Why would the Task Force
release this photo to begin with?

853
01:02:44,419 --> 01:02:46,713
Get the word out,
involve as many eyes as we can?

854
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,757
Right. It's a good way
to flush a guy out of hiding.

855
01:02:49,924 --> 01:02:51,926
Set off a bomb, get your picture taken.

856
01:02:52,093 --> 01:02:54,280
Get seven billion people looking
for the Winter Soldier.

857
01:02:54,304 --> 01:02:56,139
You're saying someone
framed him to find him?

858
01:02:56,306 --> 01:02:57,366
Steve, we looked
for the guy for two years

859
01:02:57,390 --> 01:02:58,433
and found nothing.

860
01:02:58,558 --> 01:03:00,560
We didn't bomb the UN.
That turns a lot of heads.

861
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:02,037
Yeah, but that doesn't guarantee

862
01:03:02,061 --> 01:03:03,289
that whoever framed him would get him.

863
01:03:03,313 --> 01:03:05,148
It guarantees that we would.

864
01:03:11,237 --> 01:03:12,237
Yeah.

865
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:16,409
Tell me, BUCKY.

866
01:03:16,743 --> 01:03:19,120
You've seen a great deal, haven't you?

867
01:03:20,497 --> 01:03:22,582
I don't wanna talk about it.

868
01:03:23,249 --> 01:03:25,877
You fear that if you open your mouth,

869
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,754
the horrors might never stop.

870
01:03:31,424 --> 01:03:32,509
Don't worry.

871
01:03:35,637 --> 01:03:37,931
We only have to talk about one.

872
01:04:02,163 --> 01:04:04,123
Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes.

873
01:04:04,958 --> 01:04:07,544
Friday, get me a source on that outage.

874
01:04:08,836 --> 01:04:10,964
Sub-level five, East Wing.

875
01:04:14,384 --> 01:04:15,843
What the hell is this?

876
01:04:16,010 --> 01:04:17,637
Why don't we discuss your home?

877
01:04:17,804 --> 01:04:20,848
Not Romania.
Certainly not Brooklyn, no.

878
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:25,395
I mean your real home.

879
01:04:31,484 --> 01:04:32,777
Longing

880
01:04:33,486 --> 01:04:34,487
No.

881
01:04:35,947 --> 01:04:36,656
Rusted

882
01:04:36,864 --> 01:04:38,116
Stop.

883
01:04:38,491 --> 01:04:39,492
Seventeen

884
01:04:41,828 --> 01:04:42,829
Stop.

885
01:04:45,206 --> 01:04:46,206
Daybreak

886
01:04:52,463 --> 01:04:53,463
Furnace

887
01:04:56,009 --> 01:04:57,009
Nine

888
01:05:00,054 --> 01:05:01,264
Benign

889
01:05:04,684 --> 01:05:06,311
Homecoming

890
01:05:07,061 --> 01:05:08,061
One

891
01:05:09,522 --> 01:05:10,522
Freight car

892
01:05:27,081 --> 01:05:28,207
Soldier?

893
01:05:31,169 --> 01:05:32,420
Ready to comply.

894
01:05:33,254 --> 01:05:38,635
Mission report. December 16, 1991.

895
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:50,647
Help me.

896
01:05:51,272 --> 01:05:52,273
Help.

897
01:05:55,276 --> 01:05:56,277
Get up.

898
01:05:59,739 --> 01:06:01,574
Who are you? What do you want?

899
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:04,952
To see an empire fall.

900
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:38,111
Hey.

901
01:06:44,826 --> 01:06:46,202
Evac all civilians.

902
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:48,764
Get me a perimeter around the building,
and gunships in the air.

903
01:06:48,788 --> 01:06:50,289
Please tell me you brought a suit.

904
01:06:50,456 --> 01:06:52,917
Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford,
three-piece, two-button.

905
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:54,544
I'm an active-duty non-combatant.

906
01:06:55,169 --> 01:06:56,546
Follow me.

907
01:07:13,354 --> 01:07:14,834
We're in position.

908
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:48,848
You could at least recognise me.

909
01:08:41,984 --> 01:08:43,194
Damn it.

910
01:10:20,499 --> 01:10:22,710
He asked me again
if you were going to be there.

911
01:10:22,793 --> 01:10:24,754
I said I wasn't sure.

912
01:10:24,837 --> 01:10:27,673
You should have seen his
little face. Just try, okay?

913
01:10:28,341 --> 01:10:30,092
I'm going to bed.

914
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:31,677
I love you.

915
01:10:35,556 --> 01:10:39,560
James Barnes the suspect
in the UN Vienna bombing...

916
01:10:39,685 --> 01:10:41,187
escaped custody today.

917
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:44,398
Also missing Avenger
Captain Steve Rogers...

918
01:10:44,523 --> 01:10:45,523
and Sam Wilson.

919
01:11:09,548 --> 01:11:10,549
Hey, Cap!

920
01:11:23,354 --> 01:11:24,438
Steve.

921
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:27,650
Which BUCKY am I talking to?

922
01:11:29,276 --> 01:11:31,362
Your mom's name was Sarah.

923
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:38,744
You used to wear newspapers
in your shoes.

924
01:11:40,162 --> 01:11:41,372
Can't read that in a museum.

925
01:11:41,539 --> 01:11:43,249
Just like that,
we're supposed to be cool?

926
01:11:43,624 --> 01:11:45,042
What did I do?

927
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:45,918
Enough.

928
01:11:46,085 --> 01:11:47,878
Oh, God, I knew this would happen.

929
01:11:48,045 --> 01:11:50,339
Everything HYDRA
put inside me is still there.

930
01:11:50,589 --> 01:11:52,425
All he had to do
was say the goddamn words.

931
01:11:52,633 --> 01:11:54,260
- Who was he?
- I don't know.

932
01:11:54,427 --> 01:11:56,387
People are dead.
The bombing, the setup...

933
01:11:56,595 --> 01:11:58,931
the doctor did all that just
to get 10 minutes with you.

934
01:11:59,181 --> 01:12:00,933
I need you to do
better than "I don't know."

935
01:12:04,645 --> 01:12:07,273
He wanted to know about Siberia.

936
01:12:09,942 --> 01:12:11,652
Where I was kept.

937
01:12:13,446 --> 01:12:15,197
He wanted to know exactly where.

938
01:12:15,448 --> 01:12:17,658
Why would he need to know that?

939
01:12:19,744 --> 01:12:22,079
Because I'm not the only Winter Soldier.

940
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,426
It hurts!

941
01:13:55,047 --> 01:13:56,215
Good work.

942
01:14:07,393 --> 01:14:08,769
Get me out of here.

943
01:14:22,783 --> 01:14:23,909
Who were they?

944
01:14:24,076 --> 01:14:25,661
Their most elite death squad.

945
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:27,913
More kills than anyone
in HYDRA history.

946
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,373
And that was before the serum.

947
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:30,666
They all turn out like you?

948
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:31,917
Worse.

949
01:14:32,543 --> 01:14:34,336
The doctor, could he control them?

950
01:14:35,296 --> 01:14:36,714
Enough.

951
01:14:36,881 --> 01:14:38,716
Said he wanted to see an empire fall.

952
01:14:38,966 --> 01:14:40,593
With these guys, he could do it.

953
01:14:40,885 --> 01:14:43,220
They speak 30 languages,
can hide in plain sight...

954
01:14:43,304 --> 01:14:45,514
infiltrate, assassinate, destabilize.

955
01:14:45,598 --> 01:14:47,141
They can take a whole country down

956
01:14:47,224 --> 01:14:48,864
in one night,
you'd never see them coming.

957
01:14:51,395 --> 01:14:53,439
This would have been
a lot easier a week ago.

958
01:14:54,023 --> 01:14:56,150
- If we call Tony...
- No, he won't believe us.

959
01:14:56,233 --> 01:14:57,234
Even if he did...

960
01:14:57,318 --> 01:14:59,111
Who knows if the Accords
would let him help.

961
01:15:00,571 --> 01:15:01,572
We're on our own.

962
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:03,990
Maybe not.

963
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:07,453
I know a guy.

964
01:15:08,412 --> 01:15:11,373
I don't suppose you have
any idea where they are?

965
01:15:11,457 --> 01:15:12,457
We will.

966
01:15:12,625 --> 01:15:14,210
GSG 9's got the borders covered.

967
01:15:14,293 --> 01:15:16,086
Recon's flying 24/7.

968
01:15:16,253 --> 01:15:17,755
They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.

969
01:15:17,838 --> 01:15:19,798
You don't get it, Stark.
It's not yours to handle.

970
01:15:19,924 --> 01:15:22,259
It's clear you can't be objective.

971
01:15:22,426 --> 01:15:23,928
I'm putting Special Ops on this.

972
01:15:24,011 --> 01:15:25,238
What happens
when the shooting starts?

973
01:15:25,262 --> 01:15:26,555
What, do you kill Steve Rogers?

974
01:15:26,639 --> 01:15:27,999
If we're provoked.

975
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:31,435
Barnes would've been eliminated
in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers.

976
01:15:31,602 --> 01:15:35,397
There are dead people
who would be alive now.

977
01:15:36,482 --> 01:15:38,317
Feel free to check my math.

978
01:15:38,525 --> 01:15:39,920
All due respect,
you're not gonna solve this

979
01:15:39,944 --> 01:15:41,195
with boys and bullets, Ross.

980
01:15:41,278 --> 01:15:42,518
You gotta let us bring them in.

981
01:15:42,738 --> 01:15:44,698
How would that end
any differently than last time?

982
01:15:44,823 --> 01:15:45,823
Because this time,

983
01:15:45,866 --> 01:15:47,586
I won't be wearing loafers
and a silk shirt.

984
01:15:48,827 --> 01:15:50,704
72 hours, guaranteed.

985
01:15:50,871 --> 01:15:52,706
36 hours.

986
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:55,542
Barnes.

987
01:15:57,044 --> 01:15:58,379
Rogers.

988
01:15:59,171 --> 01:16:00,171
Wilson.

989
01:16:00,214 --> 01:16:02,007
Thank you, sir.

990
01:16:05,636 --> 01:16:07,513
My left arm is numb. Is that normal?

991
01:16:10,975 --> 01:16:12,059
You all right?

992
01:16:12,226 --> 01:16:13,310
Always.

993
01:16:17,398 --> 01:16:19,650
36 hours. Jeez.

994
01:16:19,817 --> 01:16:21,860
We're seriously understaffed.

995
01:16:22,027 --> 01:16:23,195
Oh, yeah.

996
01:16:23,362 --> 01:16:26,323
It'd be great if we had
a Hulk right about now. Any shot?

997
01:16:28,284 --> 01:16:30,911
You really think he'd be on our side?

998
01:16:31,078 --> 01:16:32,121
No.

999
01:16:32,288 --> 01:16:33,580
I have an idea.

1000
01:16:33,747 --> 01:16:36,041
Me, too. Where's yours?

1001
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:38,043
Downstairs.

1002
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:39,378
Where's yours?

1003
01:17:01,358 --> 01:17:02,735
Hey, May.

1004
01:17:02,901 --> 01:17:04,069
Mmm. Hey.

1005
01:17:06,196 --> 01:17:07,948
How was school today?

1006
01:17:08,115 --> 01:17:09,366
It was okay.

1007
01:17:09,533 --> 01:17:11,827
This crazy car parked outside.

1008
01:17:15,331 --> 01:17:17,291
- Oh, Mr Parker.
- Um...

1009
01:17:19,293 --> 01:17:21,337
What are you doing...

1010
01:17:21,503 --> 01:17:23,297
Hey! Uh, I'm Peter.

1011
01:17:23,464 --> 01:17:24,715
Tony.

1012
01:17:25,215 --> 01:17:26,759
What are you doing here?

1013
01:17:26,925 --> 01:17:28,218
It's about time we met.

1014
01:17:28,302 --> 01:17:30,012
You've been getting my emails, right?

1015
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:31,805
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Right?

1016
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:33,015
Regarding the...

1017
01:17:33,098 --> 01:17:34,242
You didn't even tell me about the grant.

1018
01:17:34,266 --> 01:17:35,910
- About the grant.
- The September Foundation.

1019
01:17:35,934 --> 01:17:36,934
- Right.
- Yeah.

1020
01:17:36,977 --> 01:17:38,017
Remember when you applied?

1021
01:17:38,103 --> 01:17:39,146
Yeah.

1022
01:17:39,313 --> 01:17:41,815
I approved, so now we're in business.

1023
01:17:42,441 --> 01:17:44,521
But you didn't tell me anything.
What's up with that?

1024
01:17:44,651 --> 01:17:45,795
You keeping secrets from me now?

1025
01:17:45,819 --> 01:17:49,615
I just know how much you love surprises
so I thought I would let you know...

1026
01:17:50,282 --> 01:17:51,784
Anyway, what did I apply for?

1027
01:17:51,950 --> 01:17:53,094
That's what I'm here to hash out.

1028
01:17:53,118 --> 01:17:54,495
Okay. Hash it out, okay.

1029
01:17:54,578 --> 01:17:57,206
It's so hard for me to believe
that she's someone's aunt.

1030
01:17:57,373 --> 01:17:59,625
Yeah, well, we come in
all shapes and sizes, you know?

1031
01:18:00,084 --> 01:18:02,252
This walnut date loaf is exceptional.

1032
01:18:02,544 --> 01:18:03,938
- Let me just stop you there.
- Yeah.

1033
01:18:03,962 --> 01:18:07,758
Is this grant got money
involved or whatever? No?

1034
01:18:07,925 --> 01:18:09,235
Yeah, it's pretty well funded.

1035
01:18:09,259 --> 01:18:10,427
Yeah? Wow.

1036
01:18:10,511 --> 01:18:12,137
Look who you're talking to.

1037
01:18:12,304 --> 01:18:14,348
- Can I have five minutes with him?
- Sure.

1038
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:23,565
As walnut date loaves go,
that wasn't bad.

1039
01:18:24,858 --> 01:18:27,653
Whoa, what have we here?
Retro tech, huh?

1040
01:18:27,861 --> 01:18:29,613
Thrift store? Salvation Army?

1041
01:18:29,822 --> 01:18:31,883
- Uh, the garbage, actually.
- You're a dumpster diver?

1042
01:18:31,907 --> 01:18:32,991
Yeah, I was...

1043
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:34,535
Anyway, look, um,

1044
01:18:34,618 --> 01:18:36,338
I definitely did not apply
for your grant...

1045
01:18:36,412 --> 01:18:37,955
- Ah-ah! Me first.
- Okay.

1046
01:18:38,038 --> 01:18:40,541
Quick question of the rhetorical variety.

1047
01:18:41,875 --> 01:18:43,836
That's you, right?

1048
01:18:44,211 --> 01:18:45,212
Um, no.

1049
01:18:45,379 --> 01:18:46,859
- What do you mean?
- Yeah.

1050
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,466
Look at you go.

1051
01:18:49,633 --> 01:18:52,761
Wow! Nice catch.
3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour.

1052
01:18:52,928 --> 01:18:55,681
That's not easy. You got mad skills.

1053
01:18:55,931 --> 01:18:57,766
That's all on YouTube, though, right?

1054
01:18:57,850 --> 01:18:59,351
That's where you found that?

1055
01:18:59,518 --> 01:19:00,620
Because you know that's all fake.

1056
01:19:00,644 --> 01:19:01,844
It's all done on the computer.

1057
01:19:01,895 --> 01:19:02,938
Mmm-hmm.

1058
01:19:03,021 --> 01:19:05,107
It's like that video. What is it?

1059
01:19:05,274 --> 01:19:07,154
Yeah. Oh, you mean like
those UFOs over Phoenix?

1060
01:19:07,234 --> 01:19:08,234
Exactly.

1061
01:19:08,569 --> 01:19:09,862
Oh, what have we here?

1062
01:19:11,238 --> 01:19:12,948
Uh...

1063
01:19:18,996 --> 01:19:20,831
You're the Spider-ling.

1064
01:19:20,998 --> 01:19:22,875
Crime-fighting spider.
You're Spider-Boy?

1065
01:19:25,711 --> 01:19:27,296
Spider-Man.

1066
01:19:27,671 --> 01:19:29,506
Not in that onesie, you're not.

1067
01:19:30,048 --> 01:19:31,967
It's not a onesie.

1068
01:19:33,385 --> 01:19:34,737
I don't believe this.
I was actually having

1069
01:19:34,761 --> 01:19:36,555
a really good day today, Mr Stark.

1070
01:19:36,722 --> 01:19:39,892
Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good
DVD player was just sitting there...

1071
01:19:40,517 --> 01:19:43,145
and Algebra test, nailed it.

1072
01:19:43,937 --> 01:19:45,397
Who else knows? Anybody?

1073
01:19:46,982 --> 01:19:48,108
Nobody.

1074
01:19:48,484 --> 01:19:50,486
Not even your unusually attractive aunt?

1075
01:19:50,652 --> 01:19:51,945
No. No.

1076
01:19:52,112 --> 01:19:54,698
No! If she knew, she would freak out.

1077
01:19:54,865 --> 01:19:56,575
And when she freaks out, I freak out.

1078
01:19:56,867 --> 01:19:58,867
You know what I think
is really cool? This webbing.

1079
01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:02,539
That tensile strength is off the charts.

1080
01:20:02,623 --> 01:20:03,999
Who manufactured that?

1081
01:20:04,291 --> 01:20:05,501
I did.

1082
01:20:06,585 --> 01:20:08,170
Climbing walls, how you doing that?

1083
01:20:08,337 --> 01:20:09,588
Adhesive gloves?

1084
01:20:09,755 --> 01:20:11,048
It's a long story. I was...

1085
01:20:11,673 --> 01:20:13,884
Lordy! Can you even see in these?

1086
01:20:14,051 --> 01:20:15,052
Yes, I can.

1087
01:20:15,219 --> 01:20:16,386
I'm blind!

1088
01:20:17,346 --> 01:20:18,931
I can see in those.

1089
01:20:19,097 --> 01:20:19,932
Okay?

1090
01:20:20,098 --> 01:20:22,434
It's just that when whatever
happened, happened...

1091
01:20:22,518 --> 01:20:24,811
it's like my senses
have been dialled to 11.

1092
01:20:25,354 --> 01:20:29,650
There's way too much input,
so they just kinda help me focus.

1093
01:20:29,942 --> 01:20:32,236
You're in dire need of an upgrade.

1094
01:20:32,319 --> 01:20:34,696
Systemic, top to bottom,
hundred-point restoration.

1095
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:35,906
That's why I'm here.

1096
01:20:38,825 --> 01:20:39,952
Why you doing this?

1097
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:42,538
I gotta know, what's your MO?

1098
01:20:42,621 --> 01:20:44,541
What gets you outta that
twin bed in the morning?

1099
01:20:45,165 --> 01:20:46,375
Because...

1100
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:52,381
Because I've been me my whole life,

1101
01:20:52,464 --> 01:20:54,132
and I've had these powers
for six months.

1102
01:20:54,591 --> 01:20:55,759
Mmm-hmm.

1103
01:20:55,842 --> 01:20:58,220
I read books, I build computers.

1104
01:20:59,429 --> 01:21:02,099
Yeah, I would love to play football,

1105
01:21:02,182 --> 01:21:03,782
but I couldn't then, so I shouldn't now.

1106
01:21:03,976 --> 01:21:05,477
Sure, because you're different.

1107
01:21:05,644 --> 01:21:08,564
Exactly. But I can't tell
anybody that, so I'm not.

1108
01:21:12,276 --> 01:21:16,572
When you can do the things
that I can, but you don't...

1109
01:21:18,991 --> 01:21:21,118
and then the bad things happen...

1110
01:21:21,868 --> 01:21:23,495
they happen because of you.

1111
01:21:28,166 --> 01:21:30,752
So you wanna look out for the little guy,
you wanna do your part?

1112
01:21:30,919 --> 01:21:33,130
Make the world
a better place, all that, right?

1113
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:35,924
Yeah, just looking out for the little guy.

1114
01:21:36,925 --> 01:21:38,510
That's what it is.

1115
01:21:45,767 --> 01:21:47,936
I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg.

1116
01:21:56,862 --> 01:21:58,071
You got a passport?

1117
01:21:58,155 --> 01:21:59,674
No, I don't even have a driver's license.

1118
01:21:59,698 --> 01:22:01,158
- You ever been to Germany?
- No.

1119
01:22:01,241 --> 01:22:02,242
Oh, you'll love it.

1120
01:22:02,451 --> 01:22:04,369
- I can't go to Germany.
- Why?

1121
01:22:06,830 --> 01:22:08,040
I got homework.

1122
01:22:08,707 --> 01:22:10,626
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.

1123
01:22:10,876 --> 01:22:12,937
No, I'm being serious.
I can't just drop out of school.

1124
01:22:12,961 --> 01:22:14,081
Might be a little dangerous.

1125
01:22:14,129 --> 01:22:16,289
Better tell Aunt Hottie
I'm taking you on a field trip.

1126
01:22:18,842 --> 01:22:20,677
Don't tell Aunt May.

1127
01:22:21,511 --> 01:22:22,596
All right, Spider-Man.

1128
01:22:26,224 --> 01:22:27,434
Get me out of this.

1129
01:22:27,601 --> 01:22:28,644
Sorry. I'll get the...

1130
01:22:41,573 --> 01:22:42,824
What is it?

1131
01:22:42,991 --> 01:22:44,409
Stay here, please.

1132
01:22:51,041 --> 01:22:52,542
Guess I shoulda knocked.

1133
01:22:52,876 --> 01:22:56,129
Oh, my God! What are you doing here?

1134
01:22:56,296 --> 01:22:58,590
Disappointing my kids.

1135
01:23:02,135 --> 01:23:03,887
I'm supposed to go waterskiing.

1136
01:23:04,388 --> 01:23:06,181
Cap needs our help. Come on.

1137
01:23:06,515 --> 01:23:07,516
Clint!

1138
01:23:09,434 --> 01:23:10,727
You should not be here.

1139
01:23:13,063 --> 01:23:14,314
Really?

1140
01:23:14,815 --> 01:23:17,901
I retire for, what, like five minutes,
and it all goes to shit.

1141
01:23:18,151 --> 01:23:20,362
Please consider
the consequences of your actions.

1142
01:23:20,529 --> 01:23:21,529
Okay, they're considered.

1143
01:23:22,906 --> 01:23:24,408
Okay, we gotta go.

1144
01:23:28,787 --> 01:23:30,080
It's this way.

1145
01:23:30,539 --> 01:23:32,457
I've caused enough problems.

1146
01:23:37,003 --> 01:23:38,505
You gotta help me, Wanda.

1147
01:23:38,672 --> 01:23:40,525
Look, you wanna mope,
you can go to high school.

1148
01:23:40,549 --> 01:23:42,592
You wanna make amends,
you get off your ass.

1149
01:23:43,593 --> 01:23:44,593
Shit.

1150
01:23:51,184 --> 01:23:52,936
I knew I should've stretched.

1151
01:24:06,533 --> 01:24:09,035
Clint, you can't overpower me.

1152
01:24:09,202 --> 01:24:11,037
I know I can't.

1153
01:24:11,621 --> 01:24:13,206
But she can.

1154
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:17,836
Vision, that's enough. Let him go.

1155
01:24:18,754 --> 01:24:19,755
I'm leaving.

1156
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:21,006
I can't let you.

1157
01:24:26,052 --> 01:24:27,387
I'm sorry.

1158
01:24:30,891 --> 01:24:32,726
If you do this...

1159
01:24:33,185 --> 01:24:36,188
they will never stop being afraid of you.

1160
01:24:37,647 --> 01:24:40,984
I can't control their fear, only my own.

1161
01:24:53,205 --> 01:24:54,456
Oh...

1162
01:24:56,374 --> 01:24:58,835
Come on. We got one more stop.

1163
01:24:59,669 --> 01:25:01,379
It's just a matter of time.

1164
01:25:01,463 --> 01:25:04,216
Our satellites are running
facial, biometric,

1165
01:25:04,299 --> 01:25:05,926
and behavioural pattern scans.

1166
01:25:10,096 --> 01:25:12,641
Move or you will be moved.

1167
01:25:13,934 --> 01:25:16,603
As entertaining as that would be...

1168
01:25:16,770 --> 01:25:18,939
You really think you can find him?

1169
01:25:19,439 --> 01:25:21,107
My resources are considerable.

1170
01:25:21,274 --> 01:25:23,652
Yeah, it took the world
70 years to find Barnes...

1171
01:25:23,735 --> 01:25:26,238
so you could probably do that
in about half the time.

1172
01:25:27,447 --> 01:25:29,115
You know where they are.

1173
01:25:29,282 --> 01:25:31,368
I know someone who does.

1174
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,665
Not sure you understand
the concept of a getaway car.

1175
01:25:36,748 --> 01:25:37,749
It's low profile.

1176
01:25:38,375 --> 01:25:41,127
Good, because this stuff
tends to draw a crowd.

1177
01:25:42,963 --> 01:25:44,464
Can you move your seat up?

1178
01:25:44,631 --> 01:25:45,757
No.

1179
01:25:46,007 --> 01:25:47,050
I owe you again.

1180
01:25:47,676 --> 01:25:49,261
Keeping a list.

1181
01:25:52,389 --> 01:25:54,140
You know, he kinda tried to kill me.

1182
01:25:55,058 --> 01:25:57,769
Sorry. I'll put it on the list, too.

1183
01:26:01,106 --> 01:26:03,316
They're going to come looking for you.

1184
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:04,400
I know.

1185
01:26:07,195 --> 01:26:08,572
Thank you, Sharon.

1186
01:26:24,129 --> 01:26:25,130
That was...

1187
01:26:25,297 --> 01:26:26,214
Late.

1188
01:26:26,298 --> 01:26:27,298
Damn right.

1189
01:26:31,803 --> 01:26:32,804
I should go.

1190
01:26:32,971 --> 01:26:33,972
Okay.

1191
01:26:58,538 --> 01:26:59,706
Cap.

1192
01:26:59,873 --> 01:27:02,143
You know I wouldn't have called
if I had any other choice.

1193
01:27:02,167 --> 01:27:03,567
Hey, man, you're doing me a favour.

1194
01:27:03,710 --> 01:27:06,046
Besides, I owe a debt.

1195
01:27:06,212 --> 01:27:07,756
Thanks for having my back.

1196
01:27:07,923 --> 01:27:09,424
It was time to get off my ass.

1197
01:27:10,008 --> 01:27:11,635
How about our other recruit?

1198
01:27:11,801 --> 01:27:13,386
He's rarin' to go.

1199
01:27:14,179 --> 01:27:15,619
Had to put a little coffee in him...

1200
01:27:16,723 --> 01:27:17,849
but he should be good.

1201
01:27:21,227 --> 01:27:22,729
What time zone is this?

1202
01:27:22,896 --> 01:27:24,731
Come on. Come on.

1203
01:27:27,859 --> 01:27:29,778
- Captain America!
- Mr Lang.

1204
01:27:30,862 --> 01:27:31,863
It's an honour.

1205
01:27:32,405 --> 01:27:34,115
I'm shaking your hand too long.

1206
01:27:34,282 --> 01:27:35,533
Wow! This is awesome!

1207
01:27:35,742 --> 01:27:38,328
Captain America.
I know you, too. You're great!

1208
01:27:42,082 --> 01:27:43,083
Jeez.

1209
01:27:43,249 --> 01:27:45,043
Ah, look, I wanna say,

1210
01:27:45,126 --> 01:27:47,212
I know you know
a lot of super people, so...

1211
01:27:48,171 --> 01:27:50,006
thinks for thanking of me.

1212
01:27:50,256 --> 01:27:51,967
- Hey, man!
- What's up, Tic Tac?

1213
01:27:52,217 --> 01:27:53,218
Uh, good to see you.

1214
01:27:53,301 --> 01:27:54,861
Look, what happened last time when I...

1215
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:58,098
It was a great audition,
but it'll never happen again.

1216
01:27:58,390 --> 01:28:00,558
They tell you what we're up against?

1217
01:28:00,850 --> 01:28:03,937
Something about
some psycho-assassins?

1218
01:28:04,396 --> 01:28:06,314
We're outside the law on this one.

1219
01:28:06,398 --> 01:28:08,358
So if you come with us,
you're a wanted man.

1220
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:10,318
Yeah, well, what else is new?

1221
01:28:10,568 --> 01:28:11,568
We should get moving.

1222
01:28:11,611 --> 01:28:13,321
We got a chopper lined up.

1223
01:28:17,951 --> 01:28:19,744
They're evacuating the airport.

1224
01:28:19,911 --> 01:28:20,996
Stark.

1225
01:28:21,079 --> 01:28:22,079
Stark?

1226
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:25,125
Suit up.

1227
01:28:45,770 --> 01:28:47,915
Wow, it's so weird
how you run into people at the airport.

1228
01:28:47,939 --> 01:28:49,625
- Don't you think that's weird?
- Definitely weird.

1229
01:28:49,649 --> 01:28:51,002
Hear me out, Tony.

1230
01:28:51,026 --> 01:28:54,070
That doctor, the psychiatrist,
he's behind all of this.

1231
01:28:57,449 --> 01:28:58,533
Captain.

1232
01:28:58,700 --> 01:28:59,700
Your Highness.

1233
01:29:00,201 --> 01:29:01,202
Anyway...

1234
01:29:01,619 --> 01:29:03,663
Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in.

1235
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:06,750
That was 24 hours ago.
Can you help a brother out?

1236
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,334
You're after the wrong guy.

1237
01:29:08,543 --> 01:29:10,462
Your judgement is askew.

1238
01:29:11,129 --> 01:29:13,169
Your old war buddy killed
innocent people yesterday.

1239
01:29:13,339 --> 01:29:16,134
And there are five more
super soldiers just like him.

1240
01:29:16,217 --> 01:29:18,678
I can't let the doctor
find them first, Tony. I can't.

1241
01:29:18,970 --> 01:29:20,013
Steve...

1242
01:29:21,056 --> 01:29:23,058
you know what's about to happen.

1243
01:29:23,141 --> 01:29:25,477
Do you really wanna
punch your way out of this one?

1244
01:29:29,689 --> 01:29:31,566
All right, I've run out of patience.

1245
01:29:31,649 --> 01:29:32,650
Underoos!

1246
01:29:38,615 --> 01:29:40,450
- Nice job, kid.
- Thanks.

1247
01:29:40,533 --> 01:29:42,511
I could have stuck the landing
a little better, it's just...

1248
01:29:42,535 --> 01:29:44,370
New suit. It's nothing, Mr Stark.

1249
01:29:44,537 --> 01:29:45,663
It's perfect. Thank you.

1250
01:29:45,830 --> 01:29:47,641
Yeah, we don't really need
to start a conversation.

1251
01:29:47,665 --> 01:29:48,750
Okay. Cap. Captain.

1252
01:29:50,001 --> 01:29:51,169
Big fan. I'm Spider-Man.

1253
01:29:51,419 --> 01:29:52,438
Yeah, we'll talk about it later.

1254
01:29:52,462 --> 01:29:54,255
- Hey, everyone.
- Good job.

1255
01:29:54,756 --> 01:29:55,757
You've been busy.

1256
01:29:55,924 --> 01:29:57,967
And you've been a complete idiot.

1257
01:29:58,051 --> 01:29:59,051
Dragging in Clint...

1258
01:29:59,177 --> 01:30:00,637
"Rescuing" Wanda from a place

1259
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:02,847
she doesn't even want
to leave, a safe place.

1260
01:30:03,014 --> 01:30:04,265
I'm trying to keep...

1261
01:30:05,558 --> 01:30:08,561
I'm trying to keep you from
tearing the Avengers apart.

1262
01:30:09,145 --> 01:30:11,356
You did that when you signed.

1263
01:30:12,357 --> 01:30:13,525
All right, we're done.

1264
01:30:14,234 --> 01:30:15,735
You're gonna turn Barnes over,

1265
01:30:15,819 --> 01:30:17,987
you're gonna come with us,
now, because it's us...

1266
01:30:18,530 --> 01:30:19,906
or a squad of J-SOC guys...

1267
01:30:20,198 --> 01:30:22,700
with no compunction
about being impolite.

1268
01:30:24,702 --> 01:30:25,870
Come on.

1269
01:30:27,038 --> 01:30:28,581
We found it.

1270
01:30:29,874 --> 01:30:31,960
Their Quinjet's in
hangar five, north runway.

1271
01:30:36,172 --> 01:30:37,465
All right, Lang.

1272
01:30:38,550 --> 01:30:40,301
Hey, guys, something...

1273
01:30:40,718 --> 01:30:41,862
Whoa.
What the hell was that?

1274
01:30:41,886 --> 01:30:43,888
I believe this is yours, Captain America.

1275
01:30:44,055 --> 01:30:45,056
Oh, great.

1276
01:30:45,223 --> 01:30:46,534
All right, there's two
on the parking deck.

1277
01:30:46,558 --> 01:30:48,119
One of them's Maximoff,
I'm gonna grab her.

1278
01:30:48,143 --> 01:30:49,561
Rhodey, you wanna take Cap?

1279
01:30:49,769 --> 01:30:51,771
Got two in the terminal,
Wilson and Barnes.

1280
01:30:51,938 --> 01:30:52,938
Barnes is mine.

1281
01:30:54,315 --> 01:30:55,650
Hey, Mr Stark, what should I do?

1282
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:56,734
What we discussed.

1283
01:30:56,818 --> 01:30:57,878
Keep your distance, web them up.

1284
01:30:57,902 --> 01:30:59,112
Okay, copy that.

1285
01:31:03,992 --> 01:31:05,493
Move, Captain.

1286
01:31:05,743 --> 01:31:07,328
I won't ask a second time.

1287
01:31:09,664 --> 01:31:11,184
Look, I really don't want to hurt you.

1288
01:31:11,791 --> 01:31:13,209
I wouldn't stress about it.

1289
01:31:25,430 --> 01:31:26,764
What the hell is that?

1290
01:31:26,931 --> 01:31:29,017
Everyone's got a gimmick now.

1291
01:31:35,565 --> 01:31:36,941
You have a metal arm?

1292
01:31:37,108 --> 01:31:38,651
That is awesome, dude.

1293
01:31:40,403 --> 01:31:41,843
You have the right to remain silent!

1294
01:31:56,628 --> 01:31:57,988
Sorry, Cap, this won't kill you...

1295
01:31:58,087 --> 01:31:59,407
but it ain't gonna tickle either.

1296
01:32:04,636 --> 01:32:06,554
Wanda, I think you hurt
Vision's feelings.

1297
01:32:06,721 --> 01:32:08,139
You locked me in my room.

1298
01:32:08,348 --> 01:32:09,788
Okay, first, that's an exaggeration.

1299
01:32:09,849 --> 01:32:12,185
Second, I did it to protect you.

1300
01:32:12,435 --> 01:32:13,645
- Hey, Clint.
- Hey, man.

1301
01:32:13,853 --> 01:32:15,480
Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you.

1302
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:17,190
You got tired of shooting golf?

1303
01:32:17,357 --> 01:32:19,734
Well, I played 18, shot 18.

1304
01:32:20,652 --> 01:32:21,861
Just can't seem to miss.

1305
01:32:24,489 --> 01:32:25,782
First time for everything.

1306
01:32:25,949 --> 01:32:26,949
Made you look.

1307
01:32:37,502 --> 01:32:39,212
Multiple contusions detected.

1308
01:32:39,379 --> 01:32:41,005
Yeah, I detected that, too.

1309
01:32:48,888 --> 01:32:49,931
Oh, God!

1310
01:32:51,224 --> 01:32:52,850
Hey, buddy, I think you lost this!

1311
01:32:58,398 --> 01:32:59,565
Ahh!

1312
01:33:04,946 --> 01:33:06,239
Those wings carbon fibre?

1313
01:33:06,447 --> 01:33:07,727
Is this stuff coming out of you?

1314
01:33:07,991 --> 01:33:09,551
That would explain
the rigidity-flexibility ratio,

1315
01:33:09,575 --> 01:33:11,095
which, gotta say, that's awesome, man.

1316
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:12,888
I don't know if you've
been in a fight before...

1317
01:33:12,912 --> 01:33:14,592
but there's usually not this much talking.

1318
01:33:14,664 --> 01:33:15,707
All right, sorry. My bad.

1319
01:33:20,795 --> 01:33:22,422
Guys, look, I'd love to keep this up,

1320
01:33:22,505 --> 01:33:24,132
but I've only got one job here today...

1321
01:33:24,382 --> 01:33:27,343
and I gotta impress Mr Stark,
so, I'm really sorry.

1322
01:33:30,972 --> 01:33:32,974
You couldn't have done that earlier?

1323
01:33:33,433 --> 01:33:34,600
I hate you.

1324
01:33:41,190 --> 01:33:42,191
Great.

1325
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:43,776
Hey, Cap, heads-up!

1326
01:33:45,486 --> 01:33:46,863
Throw it at this.

1327
01:33:47,447 --> 01:33:48,489
Now!

1328
01:33:51,993 --> 01:33:53,286
Oh, come on!

1329
01:33:56,247 --> 01:33:59,042
Oh, man, I thought it was a water truck.

1330
01:33:59,751 --> 01:34:01,085
Uh, sorry.

1331
01:34:03,087 --> 01:34:04,422
All right, now I'm pissed.

1332
01:34:05,381 --> 01:34:06,716
Is this part of the plan?

1333
01:34:06,883 --> 01:34:08,426
Well, my plan was go easy on them.

1334
01:34:08,509 --> 01:34:09,594
You wanna switch it up?

1335
01:34:12,055 --> 01:34:13,055
There's our ride.

1336
01:34:15,516 --> 01:34:16,517
Come on!

1337
01:34:25,485 --> 01:34:26,569
Captain Rogers...

1338
01:34:27,612 --> 01:34:30,615
I know you believe
what you're doing is right.

1339
01:34:31,407 --> 01:34:33,242
But for the collective good...

1340
01:34:33,409 --> 01:34:35,745
you must surrender now.

1341
01:34:52,845 --> 01:34:54,472
What do we do, Cap?

1342
01:34:55,473 --> 01:34:56,933
We fight.

1343
01:34:58,518 --> 01:35:00,144
This is gonna end well.

1344
01:35:06,901 --> 01:35:08,319
They're not stopping.

1345
01:35:08,486 --> 01:35:09,486
Neither are we.

1346
01:35:40,476 --> 01:35:41,602
We're still friends, right?

1347
01:35:41,769 --> 01:35:43,229
Depends on how hard you hit me.

1348
01:35:52,113 --> 01:35:54,073
You were pulling your punches.

1349
01:35:58,494 --> 01:35:59,704
I didn't kill your father.

1350
01:35:59,954 --> 01:36:01,581
Then why did you run?

1351
01:36:19,765 --> 01:36:21,809
That thing does not obey
the laws of physics at all.

1352
01:36:22,059 --> 01:36:23,996
Look, kid, there's a lot going on here
that you don't understand.

1353
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:25,605
Mr Stark said you'd say that. Wow.

1354
01:36:35,114 --> 01:36:37,158
He also said to go for your legs.

1355
01:36:44,624 --> 01:36:45,625
Ahhh!

1356
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:50,254
Clint, can you get him off me?

1357
01:36:50,421 --> 01:36:51,589
Buckled in?

1358
01:36:51,756 --> 01:36:53,174
Yeah. No, I'm good.

1359
01:36:53,341 --> 01:36:55,384
I'm good, Arrow Guy. Let's go!

1360
01:37:17,114 --> 01:37:18,491
Stark tell you anything else?

1361
01:37:18,658 --> 01:37:21,536
That you're wrong.
You think you're right.

1362
01:37:21,953 --> 01:37:23,329
That makes you dangerous.

1363
01:37:28,334 --> 01:37:29,752
Guess he had a point.

1364
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:36,968
You got heart, kid. Where you from?

1365
01:37:37,635 --> 01:37:38,844
Queens.

1366
01:37:40,471 --> 01:37:41,472
Brooklyn.

1367
01:37:47,436 --> 01:37:48,479
Friday?

1368
01:37:48,563 --> 01:37:49,831
We have some
weapon systems offline.

1369
01:37:49,855 --> 01:37:50,856
What?

1370
01:37:51,190 --> 01:37:53,442
Oh, you're gonna have to
take this into the shop.

1371
01:37:53,734 --> 01:37:55,069
Who's speaking?

1372
01:37:55,236 --> 01:37:58,948
It's your conscience.
We don't talk a lot these days.

1373
01:37:59,156 --> 01:38:00,157
Friday?

1374
01:38:00,241 --> 01:38:01,881
Deploying fire
suppression system.

1375
01:38:02,702 --> 01:38:03,703
Uh-oh.

1376
01:38:05,663 --> 01:38:06,664
Oh, boy!

1377
01:38:09,375 --> 01:38:10,376
Whoa!

1378
01:38:16,007 --> 01:38:18,092
We gotta go.
That guy's probably in Siberia by now.

1379
01:38:18,384 --> 01:38:19,635
We gotta draw out the flyers.

1380
01:38:19,802 --> 01:38:21,554
I'll take Vision, you get to the jet.

1381
01:38:21,846 --> 01:38:23,472
No, you get to the jet!

1382
01:38:23,598 --> 01:38:24,598
Both of you!

1383
01:38:27,018 --> 01:38:28,495
The rest of us aren't getting out of here.

1384
01:38:28,519 --> 01:38:29,663
As much as I hate to admit it...

1385
01:38:29,687 --> 01:38:31,147
if we're gonna win this one,

1386
01:38:31,230 --> 01:38:32,815
some of us might have to lose it.

1387
01:38:32,982 --> 01:38:35,026
This isn't the real fight, Steve.

1388
01:38:35,192 --> 01:38:36,736
All right, Sam. What's the play?

1389
01:38:37,028 --> 01:38:39,113
We need a diversion. Something big.

1390
01:38:40,865 --> 01:38:42,491
I got something kinda big.

1391
01:38:42,575 --> 01:38:43,909
But I can't hold it very long.

1392
01:38:44,327 --> 01:38:46,329
On my signal, run like hell.

1393
01:38:46,537 --> 01:38:49,123
And if I tear myself in half...
don't come back for me.

1394
01:38:49,206 --> 01:38:50,350
He's gonna tear himself in half?

1395
01:38:50,374 --> 01:38:51,834
You sure about this, Scott?

1396
01:38:52,043 --> 01:38:53,377
I do it all the time.

1397
01:38:53,586 --> 01:38:55,379
I mean, once. In a lab.

1398
01:38:55,546 --> 01:38:57,214
Then I passed out.

1399
01:38:57,381 --> 01:38:59,216
I'm the boss, I'm the boss, I'm the boss.

1400
01:39:15,274 --> 01:39:16,776
Holy shit!

1401
01:39:21,072 --> 01:39:22,948
Okay, tiny dude is big now.
He's big now.

1402
01:39:24,992 --> 01:39:26,077
I guess that's the signal.

1403
01:39:26,327 --> 01:39:27,787
Way to go, Tic Tac!

1404
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:31,082
Give me back my Rhodey.

1405
01:39:34,752 --> 01:39:35,961
I got him.

1406
01:39:58,609 --> 01:40:01,153
Okay, anybody on our side
hiding any shocking

1407
01:40:01,237 --> 01:40:03,090
and fantastic abilities
they'd like to disclose...

1408
01:40:03,114 --> 01:40:04,240
I'm open to suggestions.

1409
01:40:12,373 --> 01:40:13,999
You wanna get to them...

1410
01:40:14,166 --> 01:40:15,292
you gotta go through me.

1411
01:40:26,262 --> 01:40:27,388
Uh-huh.

1412
01:40:42,319 --> 01:40:43,779
We haven't met yet.

1413
01:40:46,365 --> 01:40:47,992
- I'm Clint.
- I don't care.

1414
01:41:02,214 --> 01:41:03,257
Whoa!

1415
01:41:08,304 --> 01:41:09,305
Ahhh!

1416
01:41:15,895 --> 01:41:16,895
Get off!

1417
01:41:31,786 --> 01:41:33,496
Something just flew in me!

1418
01:41:57,728 --> 01:41:58,728
You're not gonna stop.

1419
01:41:59,396 --> 01:42:00,397
You know I can't.

1420
01:42:01,357 --> 01:42:02,483
I'm gonna regret this.

1421
01:42:06,153 --> 01:42:07,446
Go.

1422
01:42:13,118 --> 01:42:15,162
Hey, guys, you ever see
that really old movie,

1423
01:42:15,246 --> 01:42:17,164
Empire Strikes Back?

1424
01:42:17,414 --> 01:42:18,892
Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy?

1425
01:42:18,916 --> 01:42:20,060
I don't know, I didn't carbon-date him.

1426
01:42:20,084 --> 01:42:21,085
He's on the young side.

1427
01:42:23,128 --> 01:42:26,257
You know that part
where they're on the snow planet...

1428
01:42:27,508 --> 01:42:29,009
with the walking thingies?

1429
01:42:31,428 --> 01:42:32,614
Maybe the kid's onto something.

1430
01:42:32,638 --> 01:42:33,638
High now, Tony. Go high.

1431
01:42:42,106 --> 01:42:43,107
Yes!

1432
01:42:43,649 --> 01:42:45,234
That was awesome!

1433
01:42:59,957 --> 01:43:02,960
Does anyone have any orange slices?

1434
01:43:08,507 --> 01:43:09,693
Kid, you all right?

1435
01:43:09,717 --> 01:43:10,718
Whoa!

1436
01:43:11,635 --> 01:43:14,722
Same side. Guess who. Hi. It's me.

1437
01:43:14,889 --> 01:43:15,973
- Hey, man.
- Yeah.

1438
01:43:16,140 --> 01:43:17,349
- That was scary.
- Yeah.

1439
01:43:17,516 --> 01:43:19,143
You're done, all right?

1440
01:43:19,310 --> 01:43:20,310
What? I'm good, I'm fine.

1441
01:43:20,352 --> 01:43:21,454
You did a good job. Stay down.

1442
01:43:21,478 --> 01:43:22,789
No, it's good. I gotta get him back.

1443
01:43:22,813 --> 01:43:23,957
You're going home or I'll call Aunt May!

1444
01:43:23,981 --> 01:43:25,149
- Dude.
- You're done!

1445
01:43:25,316 --> 01:43:26,358
Wait.

1446
01:43:26,525 --> 01:43:29,528
Mr Stark, wait.
I'm not done. I'm not...

1447
01:43:31,697 --> 01:43:33,991
Okay, I'm done. I'm done.

1448
01:43:50,174 --> 01:43:52,414
I said
I'd help you find him, not catch him.

1449
01:43:52,927 --> 01:43:54,511
There's a difference.

1450
01:44:01,352 --> 01:44:02,352
I'm sorry.

1451
01:44:02,937 --> 01:44:04,021
Me, too.

1452
01:44:04,939 --> 01:44:05,939
It's as I said.

1453
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:08,108
Catastrophe.

1454
01:44:21,038 --> 01:44:22,873
Vision, I got a bandit on my six.

1455
01:44:27,628 --> 01:44:28,629
Vision! You copy?

1456
01:44:28,796 --> 01:44:30,798
Target his thruster,
turn him into a glider.

1457
01:44:45,980 --> 01:44:47,106
Rhodey!

1458
01:44:48,899 --> 01:44:50,693
Tony, I'm flying dead stick.

1459
01:44:58,909 --> 01:45:00,285
Rhodes!

1460
01:45:12,631 --> 01:45:14,091
Read vitals.

1461
01:45:14,258 --> 01:45:15,509
Heartbeat detected.

1462
01:45:15,676 --> 01:45:17,678
Emergency medical is on its way.

1463
01:45:22,850 --> 01:45:23,850
I'm sorry.

1464
01:45:45,748 --> 01:45:47,458
- This is room 201...

1465
01:45:48,792 --> 01:45:50,419
Bacon and black coffee again today?

1466
01:45:51,795 --> 01:45:53,338
You know me so well...

1467
01:45:54,965 --> 01:45:56,800
Hello? Your breakfast is here.

1468
01:45:57,801 --> 01:45:58,802
May I let myself in?

1469
01:46:23,869 --> 01:46:25,496
What's gonna happen to your friends?

1470
01:46:34,088 --> 01:46:35,631
Whatever it is...

1471
01:46:36,215 --> 01:46:37,841
I'll deal with it.

1472
01:46:40,928 --> 01:46:42,763
I don't know if I'm worth all this, Steve.

1473
01:46:50,229 --> 01:46:51,855
What you did all those years...

1474
01:46:52,898 --> 01:46:54,399
It wasn't you.

1475
01:46:55,234 --> 01:46:57,027
You didn't have a choice.

1476
01:46:58,195 --> 01:46:59,822
I know.

1477
01:47:02,407 --> 01:47:04,618
But I did it.

1478
01:47:18,841 --> 01:47:20,968
How did this happen?

1479
01:47:21,176 --> 01:47:23,178
I became distracted.

1480
01:47:25,472 --> 01:47:27,599
I didn't think that was possible.

1481
01:47:29,017 --> 01:47:30,686
Neither did I.

1482
01:47:47,244 --> 01:47:50,247
The doctors say
he shattered L4 through S1.

1483
01:47:50,414 --> 01:47:53,167
Extreme laceration to the spinal cord.

1484
01:47:53,333 --> 01:47:55,961
Probably looking at
some form of paralysis.

1485
01:47:59,298 --> 01:48:00,841
Steve's not gonna stop.

1486
01:48:01,633 --> 01:48:02,676
If you don't either,

1487
01:48:02,759 --> 01:48:04,154
Rhodey's gonna be
the best case scenario.

1488
01:48:04,178 --> 01:48:05,345
You let them go, Nat.

1489
01:48:05,512 --> 01:48:06,555
We played this wrong.

1490
01:48:06,722 --> 01:48:07,973
"We"?

1491
01:48:08,432 --> 01:48:09,474
Boy, it must be hard to

1492
01:48:09,558 --> 01:48:11,118
shake the whole
double agent thing, huh?

1493
01:48:11,143 --> 01:48:12,853
It sticks in the DNA.

1494
01:48:14,271 --> 01:48:16,857
Are you incapable
of letting go of your ego...

1495
01:48:17,149 --> 01:48:19,109
for one goddamn second?

1496
01:48:23,447 --> 01:48:25,657
T'CHALLA told Ross what you did, so...

1497
01:48:26,992 --> 01:48:28,619
they're coming for you.

1498
01:48:29,661 --> 01:48:32,414
I'm not the one that needs
to watch their back.

1499
01:48:41,048 --> 01:48:42,424
What am I looking at, Friday?

1500
01:48:42,507 --> 01:48:44,885
Priority upload
from Berlin police.

1501
01:48:47,930 --> 01:48:49,431
Fire up the chopper.

1502
01:48:55,395 --> 01:48:57,275
The Task Force
called for a psychiatrist

1503
01:48:57,356 --> 01:48:58,982
as soon as Barnes was captured.

1504
01:48:59,191 --> 01:49:01,485
The UN dispatched
Doctor Theo Broussard

1505
01:49:01,610 --> 01:49:02,945
from Geneva within the hour.

1506
01:49:03,111 --> 01:49:04,780
He was met by this man.

1507
01:49:04,947 --> 01:49:06,007
Did you run
facial recognition yet?

1508
01:49:06,031 --> 01:49:07,151
What do I look like?

1509
01:49:07,449 --> 01:49:09,329
Uh, I don't know.
I've been picturing a redhead.

1510
01:49:09,493 --> 01:49:11,036
You must be thinking of someone else.

1511
01:49:11,161 --> 01:49:12,204
Must be.

1512
01:49:12,371 --> 01:49:15,040
The fake doctor is actually
Colonel Helmut Zemo.

1513
01:49:16,291 --> 01:49:18,460
Sokovian Intelligence.

1514
01:49:19,544 --> 01:49:21,505
Zemo ran Echo Scorpion...

1515
01:49:21,672 --> 01:49:24,132
a Sokovian covert kill squad.

1516
01:49:26,343 --> 01:49:27,844
What happened to the real Broussard?

1517
01:49:27,928 --> 01:49:29,805
He was found dead
in a Berlin hotel room.

1518
01:49:29,972 --> 01:49:32,683
Where police also found
a wig and facial prosthesis...

1519
01:49:32,849 --> 01:49:36,895
approximating the appearance
of one James Buchanan Barnes.

1520
01:49:37,938 --> 01:49:39,731
Son of a bitch.

1521
01:49:41,733 --> 01:49:43,694
- Get this to Ross.
- Yes, boss.

1522
01:51:17,329 --> 01:51:19,206
This is Raft Prison Control.

1523
01:51:19,331 --> 01:51:21,792
You're cleared for landing, Mr Stark.

1524
01:51:54,241 --> 01:51:56,201
So? You got the files?

1525
01:51:56,451 --> 01:51:57,619
Let's reroute the satellites,

1526
01:51:57,786 --> 01:51:59,704
start facial scanning for this Zemo guy.

1527
01:51:59,871 --> 01:52:01,957
You seriously think
I'm gonna listen to you

1528
01:52:02,332 --> 01:52:04,167
after that fiasco in Leipzig?

1529
01:52:04,376 --> 01:52:06,670
You're lucky you're not
in one of these cells.

1530
01:52:37,492 --> 01:52:40,120
The Futurist, gentlemen!

1531
01:52:40,287 --> 01:52:42,747
The Futurist is here!

1532
01:52:42,914 --> 01:52:44,207
He sees all!

1533
01:52:45,208 --> 01:52:48,295
He knows what's best for you,
whether you like it or not.

1534
01:52:48,879 --> 01:52:49,880
Give me a break, Barton.

1535
01:52:50,130 --> 01:52:52,591
I had no idea
they'd put you here. Come on.

1536
01:52:53,216 --> 01:52:55,886
Yeah, well, you knew
they'd put us somewhere, Tony.

1537
01:52:56,094 --> 01:52:59,222
Yeah, but not some
super-max floating ocean pokey.

1538
01:52:59,389 --> 01:53:01,766
This place is for maniacs.
This is a place for...

1539
01:53:01,933 --> 01:53:03,226
Criminals?

1540
01:53:04,436 --> 01:53:06,229
Criminals, Tony.

1541
01:53:06,730 --> 01:53:09,065
Think that's the word you're looking for.

1542
01:53:10,358 --> 01:53:11,401
Right?

1543
01:53:12,027 --> 01:53:14,070
That didn't used to mean me.

1544
01:53:14,279 --> 01:53:15,697
Or Sam, or Wanda.

1545
01:53:15,947 --> 01:53:17,491
But here we are.

1546
01:53:17,657 --> 01:53:19,326
- Because you broke the law.
- Yeah.

1547
01:53:19,493 --> 01:53:20,494
I didn't make you.

1548
01:53:21,953 --> 01:53:23,993
- La, la, la, la, la...
- You read it, you broke it.

1549
01:53:25,081 --> 01:53:27,250
You're all grown up,
you got a wife and kids.

1550
01:53:27,375 --> 01:53:28,728
I don't understand, why didn't you

1551
01:53:28,752 --> 01:53:30,672
think about them before
you chose the wrong side?

1552
01:53:31,796 --> 01:53:33,757
You gotta watch your back with this guy.

1553
01:53:35,050 --> 01:53:37,177
There's a chance he's gonna break it.

1554
01:53:38,678 --> 01:53:41,890
Hank Pym always said
you never can trust a Stark.

1555
01:53:42,724 --> 01:53:44,142
Who are you?

1556
01:53:44,893 --> 01:53:46,561
Come on, man.

1557
01:53:48,063 --> 01:53:49,105
How's Rhodes?

1558
01:53:49,272 --> 01:53:52,108
They're flying him to
Columbia Medical tomorrow...

1559
01:53:52,192 --> 01:53:53,360
so fingers crossed.

1560
01:53:55,028 --> 01:53:56,488
What do you need? They feed you yet?

1561
01:53:58,698 --> 01:54:00,200
You're the good cop, now?

1562
01:54:00,909 --> 01:54:02,845
I'm just the guy who needs
to know where Steve went.

1563
01:54:02,869 --> 01:54:04,454
Well, you better go get a bad cop...

1564
01:54:04,621 --> 01:54:06,807
because you're gonna have to
go Mark Fuhrman on my ass...

1565
01:54:06,831 --> 01:54:08,750
to get information out of me.

1566
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,877
Well, I just knocked
the A out of their AV.

1567
01:54:11,086 --> 01:54:13,964
We got about 30 seconds before
they realise it's not their equipment.

1568
01:54:14,923 --> 01:54:16,108
What'd you do?

1569
01:54:16,132 --> 01:54:17,676
Get it back up!

1570
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:19,760
Just look.

1571
01:54:20,762 --> 01:54:22,180
Because that...

1572
01:54:22,347 --> 01:54:24,427
is the fellow who was
supposed to interrogate Barnes.

1573
01:54:26,059 --> 01:54:28,603
Clearly, I made a mistake.
Sam, I was wrong.

1574
01:54:28,895 --> 01:54:30,313
That's a first.

1575
01:54:30,397 --> 01:54:32,023
Cap is definitely off the reservation...

1576
01:54:32,107 --> 01:54:33,947
but he's about to need
all the help he can get.

1577
01:54:34,150 --> 01:54:35,253
We don't know each other very well.

1578
01:54:35,277 --> 01:54:36,361
You don't have to...

1579
01:54:36,444 --> 01:54:38,655
Hey, it's all right.

1580
01:54:46,580 --> 01:54:48,206
Look, I'll tell you...

1581
01:54:48,373 --> 01:54:51,209
but you have to go alone and as a friend.

1582
01:54:53,003 --> 01:54:54,045
Easy.

1583
01:54:57,007 --> 01:54:58,008
Stark?

1584
01:54:58,633 --> 01:55:00,302
Did he give you anything on Rogers?

1585
01:55:00,468 --> 01:55:01,588
Nope. Told me to go to hell.

1586
01:55:01,636 --> 01:55:03,471
I'm going back to the compound instead,

1587
01:55:03,597 --> 01:55:05,557
but you can call me anytime.

1588
01:55:05,724 --> 01:55:07,804
I'll put you on hold.
I like to watch the line blink.

1589
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:18,522
You remember that time
we had to ride back

1590
01:56:18,546 --> 01:56:20,757
from Rockaway Beach
in the back of that freezer truck?

1591
01:56:20,840 --> 01:56:23,093
Was that the time
we used our train money

1592
01:56:23,176 --> 01:56:24,344
to buy hot dogs?

1593
01:56:24,427 --> 01:56:27,514
You blew three bucks trying to win
that stuffed bear for a redhead.

1594
01:56:28,223 --> 01:56:29,224
What was her name, again?

1595
01:56:29,432 --> 01:56:31,142
Dolores. You called her Dot.

1596
01:56:31,685 --> 01:56:33,445
She's gotta be
a hundred years old right now.

1597
01:56:33,603 --> 01:56:34,646
So are we, pal.

1598
01:56:44,489 --> 01:56:46,574
He can't have
been here more than a few hours.

1599
01:56:46,741 --> 01:56:48,743
Long enough to wake them up.

1600
01:57:30,910 --> 01:57:31,911
You ready?

1601
01:57:32,078 --> 01:57:33,079
Yeah.

1602
01:57:46,676 --> 01:57:48,678
You seem a little defensive.

1603
01:57:50,013 --> 01:57:51,181
It's been a long day.

1604
01:57:51,973 --> 01:57:53,808
At ease, Soldier.
I'm not currently after you.

1605
01:57:53,975 --> 01:57:55,185
Then why are you here?

1606
01:57:56,269 --> 01:57:58,938
Could be your story's not so crazy.

1607
01:57:59,105 --> 01:58:00,105
Maybe.

1608
01:58:01,733 --> 01:58:04,527
Ross has no idea I'm here.
I'd like to keep it that way.

1609
01:58:05,612 --> 01:58:07,614
Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself.

1610
01:58:08,907 --> 01:58:10,587
Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork.

1611
01:58:14,245 --> 01:58:15,538
It's good to see you, Tony.

1612
01:58:15,747 --> 01:58:16,747
You too, Cap.

1613
01:58:17,874 --> 01:58:20,126
Hey, Manchurian Candidate,
you're killing me.

1614
01:58:20,210 --> 01:58:22,212
There's a truce here. You can drop...

1615
01:58:42,148 --> 01:58:43,483
I got heat signatures.

1616
01:58:43,650 --> 01:58:45,109
How many?

1617
01:58:46,152 --> 01:58:48,029
Uh, one.

1618
01:59:06,673 --> 01:59:08,925
If it's any comfort,

1619
01:59:09,050 --> 01:59:10,552
they died in their sleep.

1620
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:20,687
Did you really think
I wanted more of you?

1621
01:59:21,855 --> 01:59:23,565
What the hell?

1622
01:59:24,357 --> 01:59:26,150
I'm grateful to them, though.

1623
01:59:27,235 --> 01:59:28,778
They brought you here.

1624
01:59:33,491 --> 01:59:35,201
Please, Captain.

1625
01:59:35,368 --> 01:59:37,161
The Soviets built
this chamber to withstand

1626
01:59:37,245 --> 01:59:39,831
the launch blast of UR-100 rockets.

1627
01:59:39,998 --> 01:59:41,791
I'm betting I could beat that.

1628
01:59:41,958 --> 01:59:43,758
Oh, I'm sure you could, Mr Stark.

1629
01:59:44,210 --> 01:59:45,712
Given time.

1630
01:59:46,212 --> 01:59:47,797
But then you'd never know
why you came.

1631
01:59:48,006 --> 01:59:50,466
You killed innocent people in Vienna
just to bring us here?

1632
01:59:57,265 --> 02:00:00,894
I've thought about
nothing else for over a year.

1633
02:00:01,561 --> 02:00:03,313
I studied you.

1634
02:00:03,813 --> 02:00:05,231
I followed you.

1635
02:00:05,857 --> 02:00:07,650
But now that you're standing here...

1636
02:00:07,817 --> 02:00:09,819
I just realised...

1637
02:00:11,988 --> 02:00:14,490
there's a bit of green
in the blue of your eyes.

1638
02:00:16,910 --> 02:00:19,370
How nice to find a flaw.

1639
02:00:19,954 --> 02:00:21,539
You're Sokovian.

1640
02:00:22,707 --> 02:00:24,208
Is that what this is about?

1641
02:00:24,375 --> 02:00:27,879
Sokovia was a failed state
long before you blew it to hell.

1642
02:00:28,004 --> 02:00:29,130
No.

1643
02:00:30,465 --> 02:00:33,426
I'm here because I made a promise.

1644
02:00:36,638 --> 02:00:37,847
You lost someone?

1645
02:00:41,726 --> 02:00:43,770
I lost everyone.

1646
02:00:45,605 --> 02:00:47,190
And so will you.

1647
02:00:53,488 --> 02:00:57,116
An empire toppled
by its enemies can rise again.

1648
02:00:58,201 --> 02:01:00,328
But one which crumbles from within?

1649
02:01:01,955 --> 02:01:03,456
That's dead.

1650
02:01:04,582 --> 02:01:05,583
Forever.

1651
02:01:14,425 --> 02:01:16,052
I know that road.

1652
02:01:18,429 --> 02:01:19,430
What is this?

1653
02:01:42,704 --> 02:01:44,330
Help my wife.

1654
02:01:45,456 --> 02:01:47,750
Please. Help.

1655
02:01:53,339 --> 02:01:54,424
Sergeant Barnes?

1656
02:01:56,175 --> 02:01:57,510
Howard!

1657
02:02:05,101 --> 02:02:06,144
Howard!

1658
02:02:43,556 --> 02:02:45,141
No, Tony.

1659
02:02:54,317 --> 02:02:55,526
Did you know?

1660
02:02:58,029 --> 02:02:59,280
I didn't know it was him.

1661
02:02:59,447 --> 02:03:01,866
Don't bullshit me, Rogers.
Did you know?

1662
02:03:05,745 --> 02:03:06,788
Yes.

1663
02:04:03,886 --> 02:04:05,221
Get out of here!

1664
02:04:16,691 --> 02:04:17,400
It wasn't him, Tony.

1665
02:04:17,567 --> 02:04:18,669
HYDRA had control of his mind!

1666
02:04:18,693 --> 02:04:19,693
Move!

1667
02:04:19,735 --> 02:04:20,736
It wasn't him!

1668
02:04:29,745 --> 02:04:31,080
Left bootjet failing.

1669
02:04:31,956 --> 02:04:34,083
Flight systems compromised.

1670
02:04:34,792 --> 02:04:35,792
Ah, crap.

1671
02:04:49,557 --> 02:04:51,267
He's not gonna stop. Go.

1672
02:05:14,290 --> 02:05:15,291
Come on, come on.

1673
02:05:15,458 --> 02:05:17,138
Targeting system's
knackered, boss.

1674
02:05:17,210 --> 02:05:18,210
I'm eyeballing it.

1675
02:05:36,812 --> 02:05:38,439
Do you even remember them?

1676
02:05:38,606 --> 02:05:40,316
I remember all of them.

1677
02:06:03,172 --> 02:06:05,174
This isn't gonna change what happened.

1678
02:06:05,341 --> 02:06:06,842
I don't care.

1679
02:06:07,385 --> 02:06:08,761
He killed my mom.

1680
02:07:10,239 --> 02:07:11,883
You should have
seen his little face.

1681
02:07:11,907 --> 02:07:13,576
Just try, okay?

1682
02:07:13,743 --> 02:07:15,578
I'm going to bed.

1683
02:07:15,745 --> 02:07:17,413
I love you.

1684
02:07:25,379 --> 02:07:27,798
I almost killed the wrong man.

1685
02:07:28,924 --> 02:07:30,926
Hardly an innocent one.

1686
02:07:31,093 --> 02:07:32,928
This is all you wanted?

1687
02:07:33,763 --> 02:07:36,265
To see them rip each other apart.

1688
02:07:40,227 --> 02:07:42,855
My father lived outside the city.

1689
02:07:43,773 --> 02:07:46,108
I thought we would be safe there.

1690
02:07:46,734 --> 02:07:48,611
My son was excited.

1691
02:07:48,778 --> 02:07:51,614
He could see the Iron Man
from the car window.

1692
02:07:52,615 --> 02:07:55,826
I told my wife, "Don't worry.

1693
02:07:55,993 --> 02:07:59,955
"They're fighting in the city.
We're miles from harm."

1694
02:08:02,291 --> 02:08:04,627
When the dust cleared...

1695
02:08:05,461 --> 02:08:07,838
and the screaming stopped...

1696
02:08:08,589 --> 02:08:12,510
it took me two days
until I found their bodies.

1697
02:08:14,845 --> 02:08:16,430
My father...

1698
02:08:17,264 --> 02:08:20,810
still holding my wife and son in his arms.

1699
02:08:25,272 --> 02:08:27,274
And the Avengers?

1700
02:08:28,275 --> 02:08:30,027
They went home.

1701
02:08:31,987 --> 02:08:34,156
I knew I couldn't kill them.

1702
02:08:34,323 --> 02:08:36,826
More powerful men than me have tried.

1703
02:08:39,036 --> 02:08:41,288
But, if I could get them
to kill each other...

1704
02:08:45,835 --> 02:08:48,629
I'm sorry about your father.

1705
02:08:49,046 --> 02:08:50,881
He seemed a good man.

1706
02:08:52,675 --> 02:08:54,176
With a dutiful son.

1707
02:08:58,889 --> 02:09:00,683
Vengeance has consumed you.

1708
02:09:03,477 --> 02:09:05,813
It's consuming them.

1709
02:09:09,733 --> 02:09:11,819
I am done letting it consume me.

1710
02:09:15,531 --> 02:09:17,867
Justice will come soon enough.

1711
02:09:21,203 --> 02:09:23,038
Tell that to the dead.

1712
02:09:27,543 --> 02:09:30,254
The living are not done with you, yet.

1713
02:09:33,090 --> 02:09:35,551
You can't beat him
hand-to-hand.

1714
02:09:36,677 --> 02:09:37,845
Analyze his fight pattern.

1715
02:09:38,137 --> 02:09:39,305
Scanning.

1716
02:09:44,018 --> 02:09:45,060
Countermeasures ready.

1717
02:09:47,229 --> 02:09:48,229
Let's kick his ass.

1718
02:10:01,911 --> 02:10:03,204
He's my friend.

1719
02:10:03,954 --> 02:10:04,997
So was I.

1720
02:10:12,046 --> 02:10:14,131
Stay down. Final warning.

1721
02:10:28,604 --> 02:10:30,773
I could do this all day.

1722
02:11:37,131 --> 02:11:39,383
That shield doesn't belong to you.

1723
02:11:41,010 --> 02:11:42,678
You don't deserve it.

1724
02:11:42,845 --> 02:11:44,888
My father made that shield!

1725
02:12:20,549 --> 02:12:22,384
Meals at 8 and 5.

1726
02:12:22,551 --> 02:12:24,178
Toilet privileges twice a day.

1727
02:12:26,555 --> 02:12:28,724
Raise your voice, zap.

1728
02:12:29,391 --> 02:12:31,393
Touch the glass, zap.

1729
02:12:31,727 --> 02:12:33,729
You step out of line, you deal with me.

1730
02:12:33,896 --> 02:12:36,065
Please, step out of line, hmm?

1731
02:12:38,275 --> 02:12:39,693
So how does it feel?

1732
02:12:40,611 --> 02:12:43,072
To spend all that time, all that effort...

1733
02:12:45,949 --> 02:12:50,079
to see it fail so spectacularly?

1734
02:12:54,083 --> 02:12:55,334
Did it?

1735
02:13:20,818 --> 02:13:22,045
It's just the first pass.

1736
02:13:22,069 --> 02:13:23,069
Yeah.

1737
02:13:23,112 --> 02:13:25,155
Give me some feedback,
anything you think of.

1738
02:13:25,322 --> 02:13:27,991
Shock absorption, lateral movement.

1739
02:13:28,617 --> 02:13:29,618
Cup holder?

1740
02:13:29,785 --> 02:13:31,505
You may wanna think about
some AC down in...

1741
02:13:31,620 --> 02:13:32,663
Ow.

1742
02:13:35,249 --> 02:13:36,489
Let's go. I'll give you a hand.

1743
02:13:36,625 --> 02:13:38,293
No. Don't help me.

1744
02:13:41,505 --> 02:13:42,506
Ah.

1745
02:13:54,351 --> 02:13:55,644
138.

1746
02:13:56,478 --> 02:13:59,106
138 combat missions.

1747
02:13:59,273 --> 02:14:01,024
That's how many I've flown, Tony.

1748
02:14:01,275 --> 02:14:04,319
Every one of them
could've been my last, but I flew them.

1749
02:14:06,196 --> 02:14:07,740
Because the fight needed to be fought.

1750
02:14:08,240 --> 02:14:09,867
It's the same with these Accords.

1751
02:14:10,534 --> 02:14:14,037
I signed because it was
the right thing to do.

1752
02:14:15,998 --> 02:14:18,041
And yeah, this sucks. This is, uh...

1753
02:14:19,334 --> 02:14:21,170
This is a bad beat.

1754
02:14:23,213 --> 02:14:24,840
But it hasn't changed my mind.

1755
02:14:26,508 --> 02:14:27,885
I don't think.

1756
02:14:38,312 --> 02:14:39,688
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah.

1757
02:14:43,025 --> 02:14:46,028
Are you Tony Stank?

1758
02:14:46,236 --> 02:14:50,491
Yes, this is Tony Stank.
You're in the right place.

1759
02:14:50,657 --> 02:14:52,367
Thank you for that!

1760
02:14:52,534 --> 02:14:54,369
Never dropping that, by the way.

1761
02:14:54,536 --> 02:14:56,455
"Table for one, Mr Stank.

1762
02:14:56,538 --> 02:14:58,138
"Please, by the bathroom."

1763
02:15:04,254 --> 02:15:05,254
Tony...

1764
02:15:06,423 --> 02:15:08,383
I'm glad you're back at the compound.

1765
02:15:08,550 --> 02:15:11,595
I don't like the idea of you
rattling around a mansion by yourself.

1766
02:15:11,762 --> 02:15:13,138
We all need family.

1767
02:15:14,556 --> 02:15:18,393
The Avengers are yours.
Maybe more so than mine.

1768
02:15:19,186 --> 02:15:21,730
I've been on my own since I was 18.

1769
02:15:22,523 --> 02:15:25,192
I never really fit in anywhere,

1770
02:15:25,275 --> 02:15:27,110
even in the Army.

1771
02:15:28,737 --> 02:15:31,907
My faith's in people, I guess.

1772
02:15:32,074 --> 02:15:33,283
Individuals.

1773
02:15:34,243 --> 02:15:37,287
And I'm happy to say that,
for the most part...

1774
02:15:37,454 --> 02:15:39,081
they haven't let me down.

1775
02:15:41,083 --> 02:15:43,585
Which is why I can't
let them down either.

1776
02:15:47,548 --> 02:15:50,926
Locks can be replaced,
but maybe they shouldn't.

1777
02:15:52,803 --> 02:15:54,930
I know I hurt you, Tony.

1778
02:15:55,097 --> 02:15:58,183
I guess I thought by not telling you
about your parents...

1779
02:15:58,267 --> 02:16:00,602
I was sparing you...

1780
02:16:00,769 --> 02:16:03,438
but I can see now that
I was really sparing myself.

1781
02:16:03,939 --> 02:16:05,941
And I'm sorry.

1782
02:16:06,108 --> 02:16:08,277
Hopefully one day you can understand.

1783
02:16:09,152 --> 02:16:10,904
I wish we agreed on the Accords.

1784
02:16:10,988 --> 02:16:12,573
I really do.

1785
02:16:12,739 --> 02:16:14,300
I know you're doing what you believe in,

1786
02:16:14,324 --> 02:16:15,868
and that's all any of us can do.

1787
02:16:15,951 --> 02:16:17,327
That's all any of us should.

1788
02:16:17,411 --> 02:16:19,413
Priority call
from Secretary Ross.

1789
02:16:19,496 --> 02:16:21,790
There's been a breach
at the Raft prison.

1790
02:16:23,083 --> 02:16:24,835
Yeah, put him through.

1791
02:16:25,961 --> 02:16:27,480
Tony, we have a problem.

1792
02:16:27,504 --> 02:16:29,506
- Uh, please hold.
- No, don't.

1793
02:16:32,259 --> 02:16:33,635
So no matter what...

1794
02:16:34,803 --> 02:16:36,138
I promise you...

1795
02:16:36,263 --> 02:16:37,931
if you need us...

1796
02:16:38,807 --> 02:16:40,767
if you need me...

1797
02:16:45,022 --> 02:16:46,315
I'll be there.

1798
02:18:45,642 --> 02:18:46,685
You sure about this?

1799
02:18:48,895 --> 02:18:50,772
I can't trust my own mind.

1800
02:18:53,567 --> 02:18:56,153
So, until they figure out
how to get this stuff out of my head...

1801
02:18:56,319 --> 02:18:58,780
I think going back under
is the best thing.

1802
02:18:59,489 --> 02:19:00,991
For everybody.

1803
02:19:23,263 --> 02:19:24,639
Thank you for this.

1804
02:19:27,142 --> 02:19:29,186
Your friend and my father...

1805
02:19:30,145 --> 02:19:31,980
they were both victims.

1806
02:19:33,482 --> 02:19:36,818
If I can help one of them find peace...

1807
02:19:39,654 --> 02:19:42,365
You know, if they find out he's here...

1808
02:19:42,532 --> 02:19:44,576
they'll come for him.

1809
02:19:46,495 --> 02:19:48,163
Let them try.

1810
02:23:39,060 --> 02:23:43,481
Hey, shady baby
I'm hot like the prodigal son

1811
02:23:48,445 --> 02:23:50,155
Pick a petal
Eenie, meenie, miney, Moe

1812
02:23:50,238 --> 02:23:53,116
And flower You're the chosen one

1813
02:23:57,037 --> 02:24:01,666
Well, your left hand's free
And your right's in a grip

1814
02:24:01,750 --> 02:24:06,296
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip

1815
02:24:06,379 --> 02:24:09,090
Towards his gun

1816
02:24:09,174 --> 02:24:11,926
Oh, no

1817
02:24:21,353 --> 02:24:25,607
I tackle, we tussle
Oh, my days, we're rolling

1818
02:24:30,820 --> 02:24:35,825
My right hand's gripped on his
Colt Single Action Army

1819
02:24:37,452 --> 02:24:39,371
Oh, no

1820
02:24:39,454 --> 02:24:44,042
Well, your left hand's free
And your right's in a grip

1821
02:24:44,125 --> 02:24:48,671
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip

1822
02:24:48,755 --> 02:24:51,383
Towards his gun

1823
02:24:51,466 --> 02:24:54,260
Oh, no

1824
02:24:54,344 --> 02:24:56,638

1825
02:24:56,721 --> 02:24:58,973
Girl, you're the one for me

1826
02:25:03,812 --> 02:25:05,647
Though your man's bigger than I am

1827
02:25:05,730 --> 02:25:10,402
Oh, my days He disagrees

1828
02:25:10,485 --> 02:25:12,487
Oh, no

1829
02:25:12,570 --> 02:25:13,988
Speak easy

1830
02:25:31,047 --> 02:25:33,425
Well, my left hand's free

1831
02:25:33,508 --> 02:25:35,760
Oh

1832
02:25:35,844 --> 02:25:38,096
Well, my left hand's free

1833
02:25:38,179 --> 02:25:40,473
Oh

1834
02:25:40,557 --> 02:25:42,475
Well, my left hand's free

1835
02:25:42,559 --> 02:25:43,601
Oh

1836

Oh, no

1837
02:25:45,937 --> 02:25:50,567

Who was it? Who hit you?

1852
02:26:32,233 --> 02:26:33,401
Some guy.

1853
02:26:33,568 --> 02:26:35,195
So itchy, man, God.

1854
02:26:35,361 --> 02:26:36,571
What's "some guy's" name?

1855
02:26:36,738 --> 02:26:38,239
Uh, Steve.

1856
02:26:38,406 --> 02:26:40,408
Steve? From 12-C?

1857
02:26:40,575 --> 02:26:42,452
- With the overbite?
- No, no, no.

1858
02:26:42,744 --> 02:26:44,370
You don't know him. He's from Brooklyn.

1859
02:26:47,290 --> 02:26:48,291
Ouch.

1860
02:26:48,416 --> 02:26:49,417
Well...

1861
02:26:50,210 --> 02:26:51,961
I hope you got a few good licks in.

1862

Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually.

1863
02:26:55,215 --> 02:26:58,259
His friend was huge. Like huge.

02:27:00,762 --> 02:27:03,097
That's way better. Thank you.

1865
02:27:03,264 --> 02:27:05,266
Okay, tough guy.

Love you, May.
Hey, can you shut the door?
