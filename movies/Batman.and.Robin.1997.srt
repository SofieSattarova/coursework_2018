1
00:02:09,376 --> 00:02:10,777
I want a car.

2
00:02:12,934 --> 00:02:14,613
Chicks dig the car.

3
00:02:14,814 --> 00:02:17,452
This is why Superman works alone.

4
00:02:25,297 --> 00:02:28,931
Do try and bring this one
back in one piece, sir!

5
00:02:57,616 --> 00:02:58,853
Don't wait up, Al.

6
00:02:59,016 --> 00:03:00,973
I'll cancel the pizzas.

7
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,651
Batman,

8
00:03:17,814 --> 00:03:19,971
a new villain has commandeered
the Gotham Museum.

9
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:21,937
He's frozen
the antiquities wing.

10
00:03:22,177 --> 00:03:24,498
He's turned
the security guards into ice.

11
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,857
He's calling himself Mr. Freeze.

12
00:03:27,097 --> 00:03:28,814
Mr. Freeze.

13
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:53,615
Stop! Drop your weapon.

14
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,053
Or we'll shoot!

15
00:04:08,058 --> 00:04:09,890
The Iceman Cometh.

16
00:04:11,338 --> 00:04:13,496
Please, show some mercy.

17
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:14,972
Mercy?!

18
00:04:17,092 --> 00:04:21,609
I'm afraid that my condition has
left me cold to your pleas of mercy.

19
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:40,694
In this universe...

20
00:04:40,895 --> 00:04:43,255
there's only one absolute.

21
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,218
Everything...

22
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:48,136
freezes.

23
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:54,571
Hi, Freeze.

24
00:04:54,773 --> 00:04:55,971
I'm Batman.

25
00:05:14,452 --> 00:05:16,457
You're not sending me to the cooler.

26
00:05:33,614 --> 00:05:34,534
Nice catch.

27
00:05:34,774 --> 00:05:36,098
You break it, you buy it.

28
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,534
Grab the gem!
Kill the heroes!

29
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:54,137
Kill them! Kill them!

30
00:05:55,135 --> 00:05:57,053
Destroy everything!

31
00:06:07,497 --> 00:06:09,050
It's the hockey team from hell.

32
00:06:42,377 --> 00:06:43,374
Get the ice...

33
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,014
I'll get the Iceman.

34
00:07:10,132 --> 00:07:11,177
Thanks.

35
00:07:26,694 --> 00:07:27,855
Sweet.

36
00:07:32,372 --> 00:07:33,014
I got mine.

37
00:07:33,695 --> 00:07:35,009
Where's yours?

38
00:07:36,572 --> 00:07:38,212
What killed the dinosaurs?

39
00:07:38,817 --> 00:07:40,610
The Ice Age!

40
00:08:30,691 --> 00:08:31,852
Hit me, boys.

41
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,417
Thanks for playing.

42
00:09:01,937 --> 00:09:03,931
I was hoping you'd drop in.

43
00:09:59,652 --> 00:10:00,812
Watch the numbers...

44
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,373
for they are
the harbingers of your doom.

45
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,533
Can you feel it coming?

46
00:10:04,735 --> 00:10:07,497
The icy cold of space.

47
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,656
At 30,000 feet
your heart will freeze...

48
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,977
and beat no more.

49
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,771
After you're frozen, your icy tomb
will plummet back to Gotham.

50
00:10:27,972 --> 00:10:29,372
Freeze, you're mad.

51
00:10:30,178 --> 00:10:32,211
This capsule explodes,
it'll slaughter thousands.

52
00:10:32,451 --> 00:10:33,496
Freeze well.

53
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,412
- Who invited you?
- I was just hanging around.

54
00:10:58,614 --> 00:11:01,289
I thought you'd stay in the museum,
round up some thugs.

55
00:11:01,491 --> 00:11:04,090
How about, nice to see you,
thanks for saving my life.

56
00:11:16,778 --> 00:11:17,535
A Batbomb?

57
00:11:17,737 --> 00:11:20,374
We must blow this up
before it turns Gotham into a crater.

58
00:11:22,532 --> 00:11:23,616
Now what, call a taxi?!

59
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:25,697
Watch the first step!

60
00:11:26,857 --> 00:11:27,855
Surf's up!

61
00:12:01,297 --> 00:12:02,697
Gotcha!

62
00:12:08,451 --> 00:12:09,890
Cowabunga!

63
00:12:27,651 --> 00:12:29,972
He's freezing the furnace!

64
00:13:08,851 --> 00:13:09,973
I got him.

65
00:13:16,898 --> 00:13:17,857
Stay cool...

66
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,410
Birdboy.

67
00:13:28,771 --> 00:13:32,377
Can you be cold?
You have 11 minutes to thaw the bird.

68
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,650
Will you chase the villain...

69
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:35,733
or save him?

70
00:13:36,932 --> 00:13:38,169
Emotion makes you weak.

71
00:13:38,697 --> 00:13:40,692
That's why this day is mine.

72
00:13:42,178 --> 00:13:44,010
I'll kill you next time!

73
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,174
Did we get him?

74
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:42,492
Drats!

75
00:14:42,655 --> 00:14:47,374
My experiment to mate the orchid and
the rattlesnake has failed again...

76
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:52,418
but I still have hope for
the animal-plant crossbreedings.

77
00:14:54,097 --> 00:14:56,293
If I can only find
the right dose of venom...

78
00:14:56,532 --> 00:14:59,812
these plants will be able to
fight back, like animals.

79
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,258
I will have given flora...

80
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:06,813
a chance against
the thoughtless ravages of man.

81
00:15:09,892 --> 00:15:11,254
Personal note.

82
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,690
My work would proceed faster...

83
00:15:13,891 --> 00:15:17,257
if Dr. Woodrue didn't whisk
my venom samples...

84
00:15:17,497 --> 00:15:20,173
back to his mysterious
Gilgamesh Wing.

85
00:15:20,777 --> 00:15:22,897
Why won't he let me in the lab?

86
00:15:24,978 --> 00:15:27,011
What is he doing in there?

87
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:47,937
Ladies and gentlemen
of the un-United Nations...

88
00:15:48,091 --> 00:15:49,414
and...

89
00:15:51,092 --> 00:15:52,531
our mystery bidder.

90
00:15:52,895 --> 00:15:54,535
May I present...

91
00:15:54,737 --> 00:15:56,731
Antonio Diego...

92
00:15:57,297 --> 00:16:00,251
serial murderer, serving life...

93
00:16:00,414 --> 00:16:01,335
in prison...

94
00:16:01,536 --> 00:16:03,416
and sole surviving...

95
00:16:03,656 --> 00:16:05,133
volunteer.

96
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:08,691
And what a charmer he is.

97
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:14,138
By merely drilling three
concentric holes directly...

98
00:16:14,455 --> 00:16:18,013
into Antonio's cranial cavity
I have...

99
00:16:18,214 --> 00:16:22,050
created viaducts into
the most primitive part of his brain.

100
00:16:22,654 --> 00:16:24,774
The limbic system.

101
00:16:27,095 --> 00:16:28,974
And now I add...

102
00:16:29,137 --> 00:16:31,056
my Super-Soldier Serum...

103
00:16:31,736 --> 00:16:32,772
code-named...

104
00:16:33,338 --> 00:16:34,297
Venom.

105
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:37,539
to which I add
my very own recipe of steroids...

106
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,332
and toxins.

107
00:16:41,097 --> 00:16:42,535
Plug him in.

108
00:16:42,737 --> 00:16:44,137
Time to scream.

109
00:17:16,457 --> 00:17:17,857
Genius!

110
00:17:18,135 --> 00:17:19,171
Behold...

111
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,933
the ideal killing machine!

112
00:17:22,172 --> 00:17:24,215
I call this little number...

113
00:17:24,695 --> 00:17:25,778
Bane.

114
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,214
Bane of Humanity!

115
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,219
Imagine it.

116
00:17:30,852 --> 00:17:34,496
Your own private army made up of
thousands of these super-soldiers.

117
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,970
Bidding begins at a mere...

118
00:17:37,172 --> 00:17:38,534
10 million!

119
00:17:38,773 --> 00:17:39,656
Turbo!

120
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,814
Show off for Daddy.

121
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,215
Dr. Isley.

122
00:18:25,536 --> 00:18:27,656
Welcome to my parlor.

123
00:18:28,893 --> 00:18:29,890
What?

124
00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:31,492
You monster!

125
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:33,218
How could you?!

126
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:36,613
Our original sponsor had
no stomach for military applications.

127
00:18:36,776 --> 00:18:38,819
He cut the funding for our work.

128
00:18:39,337 --> 00:18:40,814
Without your research...

129
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:42,492
I couldn't have come this far.

130
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:43,537
Join me.

131
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:46,856
The two of us,
entwined, side by side.

132
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:47,815
Join you?

133
00:18:48,572 --> 00:18:52,850
I have spent my life trying to
protect plants from extinction...

134
00:18:53,051 --> 00:18:54,336
and now you...

135
00:18:54,538 --> 00:18:56,772
corrupt my research...

136
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:00,455
into some maniacal scheme
for world domination.

137
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,051
When I get through...

138
00:19:04,253 --> 00:19:08,731
you won't be able to get a job
teaching high school chemistry.

139
00:19:08,933 --> 00:19:10,295
Do you hear me?!

140
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,577
You psycho!

141
00:19:14,812 --> 00:19:15,934
Well...

142
00:19:16,135 --> 00:19:18,015
I can respect your opinion.

143
00:19:18,178 --> 00:19:20,777
Sadly, I'm not good at rejection.

144
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,973
I'm afraid you'll have to die.

145
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:51,332
Let the poisons and toxins
burn a grave for you...

146
00:19:51,495 --> 00:19:54,056
deep into the earth
you love so much!

147
00:19:54,219 --> 00:19:55,772
Bye-bye, dear!

148
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,614
Fellow maniacs...

149
00:19:57,854 --> 00:19:59,378
bidding...

150
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,210
begins!

151
00:20:07,492 --> 00:20:11,290
Gotham University Labs
security video, 2 years ago.

152
00:20:12,853 --> 00:20:14,292
Dr. Victor Fries...

153
00:20:14,493 --> 00:20:18,617
Two-time Olympic decathlete and Nobel
Prize winner for molecular biology.

154
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,254
After his wife
contracted a rare disease...

155
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:22,654
MacGregor's Syndrome...

156
00:20:22,856 --> 00:20:25,896
he hoped to freeze her in a cryogenic
sleep until he could find a cure.

157
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,610
Now, here's where
everything goes north.

158
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,455
That's got to hurt.

159
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:38,939
That liquid is 50 below.

160
00:20:39,131 --> 00:20:41,097
But he survived somehow.

161
00:20:41,854 --> 00:20:44,252
The cryo-solution mutated his body.

162
00:20:48,932 --> 00:20:51,291
- What happened to his wife?
- No one knows.

163
00:20:51,454 --> 00:20:52,893
She's presumed dead.

164
00:20:53,094 --> 00:20:54,974
Freeze needs
extreme cold to survive.

165
00:20:55,137 --> 00:20:59,894
His cryo-suit uses diamond-enhanced
lasers to keep him at zero degrees.

166
00:21:01,217 --> 00:21:04,095
If it's ice the Iceman wants...

167
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:15,373
Coming, sir.

168
00:21:16,936 --> 00:21:18,135
Yes, sir?

169
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,015
We need the Wayne diamonds.

170
00:21:20,254 --> 00:21:21,894
We going to trap a snowman?

171
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:26,536
Yes, right after you spend
10 hours in the simulator, training.

172
00:21:26,699 --> 00:21:29,979
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

173
00:21:30,171 --> 00:21:32,137
You were reckless
and almost got killed.

174
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,496
I'm fine! See!
Me, here, alive!

175
00:21:34,851 --> 00:21:37,690
How we supposed to work together
if you won't trust me?

176
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,495
How indeed?

177
00:21:42,974 --> 00:21:45,055
He's overeager, he's impulsive.

178
00:21:45,218 --> 00:21:47,453
I can't trust him not to get hurt.

179
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:51,452
Perhaps the truth is
you really don't trust anyone.

180
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,770
Don't tell me
you're on his side again.

181
00:21:55,451 --> 00:21:57,695
Despite all your talents...

182
00:21:57,897 --> 00:22:00,937
you're still just
a novice in the ways of family.

183
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:01,896
Master Dick...

184
00:22:02,212 --> 00:22:04,418
follows the same star as you...

185
00:22:04,773 --> 00:22:07,497
but gets there by his own course.

186
00:22:08,216 --> 00:22:11,659
You must learn to trust him,
for that is the nature of family.

187
00:22:12,618 --> 00:22:14,373
I trust you, Alfred.

188
00:22:15,457 --> 00:22:17,691
But I shan't be here forever.

189
00:22:21,058 --> 00:22:22,813
Good night, Master Bruce.

190
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:26,294
Good night, Alfred.

191
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,978
Oh, dear, Master Bruce.

192
00:22:48,131 --> 00:22:50,452
Good gracious, what a tumble.

193
00:22:50,692 --> 00:22:52,735
There's a brave boy.

194
00:23:01,577 --> 00:23:02,210
Yes, sir.

195
00:23:02,373 --> 00:23:06,219
I am so pleased you won the bidding,
Your Supreme Ruthlessness.

196
00:23:06,497 --> 00:23:09,451
We're making the final modifications
on Bane right now.

197
00:23:09,652 --> 00:23:14,294
We'll have a flawless super-soldier
out to you tomorrow by overnight mail.

198
00:23:34,491 --> 00:23:36,294
Dr. Isley?

199
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:38,817
Pamela?

200
00:23:40,092 --> 00:23:41,377
You look great.

201
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,015
Especially for a dead woman.

202
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,853
Hello, Jason.

203
00:23:48,091 --> 00:23:50,699
I think I've had a change of heart.

204
00:23:50,977 --> 00:23:52,138
Or quite...

205
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:53,576
literally...

206
00:23:54,698 --> 00:23:58,496
the animal-plant toxins had
a rather unique effect on me.

207
00:23:58,659 --> 00:24:01,210
They replaced my blood with aloe...

208
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:04,337
my skin with chlorophyll...

209
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,053
and filled...

210
00:24:06,293 --> 00:24:07,971
my lips...

211
00:24:18,818 --> 00:24:20,055
with venom.

212
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,330
And, Jason, one other thing.

213
00:24:26,212 --> 00:24:29,694
I probably should
have mentioned this earlier.

214
00:24:30,653 --> 00:24:31,650
I'm...

215
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:33,818
poison.

216
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:41,979
It's a jungle in here.

217
00:24:43,331 --> 00:24:45,019
I am Nature's arm...

218
00:24:45,892 --> 00:24:47,455
her spirit...

219
00:24:48,337 --> 00:24:49,095
her will!

220
00:24:50,332 --> 00:24:52,653
Hell, I am Mother Nature.

221
00:24:52,855 --> 00:24:54,734
And the time has come...

222
00:24:54,974 --> 00:24:56,739
for plants to take back...

223
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,616
the world so rightfully ours...

224
00:24:59,817 --> 00:25:01,256
because it's not nice...

225
00:25:02,531 --> 00:25:05,015
to fool with Mother Nature.

226
00:25:10,856 --> 00:25:12,937
Wayne Enterprises.

227
00:25:17,214 --> 00:25:19,056
Coming, Bane, darling.

228
00:25:19,573 --> 00:25:21,213
We've got a plane to catch.

229
00:25:36,414 --> 00:25:38,936
I'm Mr. Icicle.

230
00:25:39,215 --> 00:25:40,979
I'm Mr. Ten Below.

231
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:42,533
Sing! Sing!

232
00:25:48,095 --> 00:25:49,774
Come on, sing!

233
00:25:50,972 --> 00:25:52,258
Louder! Come on!

234
00:25:52,459 --> 00:25:54,252
Sing! Sing! Sing!

235
00:25:54,454 --> 00:25:56,132
He's Mr. White Christmas.

236
00:25:56,573 --> 00:25:57,810
Louder!

237
00:25:59,537 --> 00:26:01,014
He's Mr. Icicle.

238
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:03,373
Freezy...

239
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:05,531
I'm feeling hot.

240
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:07,573
I find that unlikely.

241
00:26:08,254 --> 00:26:11,611
So my hair is
brittle and my skin is dry...

242
00:26:11,812 --> 00:26:13,894
I'd weather blizzards to have you.

243
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:16,579
You're the most perfect man
I've ever known.

244
00:26:16,732 --> 00:26:18,775
Let's heat things up.

245
00:26:19,015 --> 00:26:21,412
My passion thaws
for my bride alone.

246
00:26:23,177 --> 00:26:25,373
Talk about your cold shoulder.

247
00:26:30,936 --> 00:26:31,617
Frosty!

248
00:26:31,818 --> 00:26:32,978
Yeah, boss?

249
00:26:34,014 --> 00:26:35,251
Energy.

250
00:26:36,373 --> 00:26:38,857
Battling the Bat
exhausted my power.

251
00:26:43,499 --> 00:26:44,497
But...

252
00:26:45,619 --> 00:26:47,892
I was successful nevertheless.

253
00:26:49,014 --> 00:26:50,299
Absolutely, boss.

254
00:26:50,491 --> 00:26:52,974
One more giant diamond of this size...

255
00:26:53,137 --> 00:26:56,015
and my freezing engine
will be complete.

256
00:26:59,055 --> 00:27:00,455
I will freeze the city.

257
00:27:00,973 --> 00:27:03,610
Then I will hold Gotham ransom.

258
00:27:03,773 --> 00:27:06,094
Unless the city bows
to my demands...

259
00:27:06,296 --> 00:27:07,974
it's winter forever
in Gotham.

260
00:27:08,578 --> 00:27:10,899
The city fathers
will have no choice...

261
00:27:11,091 --> 00:27:14,850
but to give me the billions
I need to complete my research...

262
00:27:17,018 --> 00:27:19,012
so I can find a cure.

263
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:21,611
Leave us.

264
00:27:21,813 --> 00:27:22,897
Sure, boss.

265
00:27:24,891 --> 00:27:26,972
We need quality time.

266
00:27:42,854 --> 00:27:45,655
Soon we will be together
once more.

267
00:27:46,614 --> 00:27:48,091
Soon.

268
00:28:10,177 --> 00:28:11,251
I'll get it.

269
00:28:21,177 --> 00:28:23,815
I must've dozed off.
My sincerest apologies.

270
00:28:24,055 --> 00:28:25,531
No apology necessary.

271
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:28,418
It's the first time it's happened
in thirty years.

272
00:28:40,895 --> 00:28:42,535
Please be looking for me.

273
00:28:42,813 --> 00:28:45,575
Actually, I'm looking for
Alfred Pennyworth.

274
00:28:49,939 --> 00:28:51,416
Uncle Alfred!

275
00:28:51,656 --> 00:28:52,931
My dear.

276
00:28:53,094 --> 00:28:54,811
Oh, my dear...

277
00:28:55,012 --> 00:28:57,372
What a most wonderful surprise.

278
00:28:57,573 --> 00:29:00,412
How did you manage
to come here all the way from England?

279
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,299
My dear, you are so kind
to your old uncle.

280
00:29:03,855 --> 00:29:04,814
Uncle?

281
00:29:08,017 --> 00:29:11,335
Barbara is the daughter
of my dear sister Margaret.

282
00:29:11,853 --> 00:29:15,133
Both my parents were killed
in a car accident 5 years ago.

283
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:17,579
Uncle Alfred's been supporting me
ever since.

284
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,458
- You have?
- Secrets, Al?

285
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:23,611
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite
in this house.

286
00:29:23,812 --> 00:29:25,414
Don't you think, sir?

287
00:29:25,855 --> 00:29:26,776
I'm on break from...

288
00:29:26,977 --> 00:29:29,893
Oxbridge Academy,
Alfred's alma mater.

289
00:29:30,219 --> 00:29:32,933
The new computer sciences division.

290
00:29:33,134 --> 00:29:35,973
- How'd you know?
- Says so on the patch on your sweater.

291
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:44,259
- What is it? It's beautiful.
- You can say that again.

292
00:29:44,815 --> 00:29:47,453
It's a competition racer.
I've been fixing it up.

293
00:29:47,654 --> 00:29:48,891
I'll show you how to ride it.

294
00:29:49,093 --> 00:29:50,819
You certainly will not!

295
00:29:51,011 --> 00:29:54,492
Don't worry, Uncle Alfred.
I'm terrified of these things.

296
00:29:54,655 --> 00:29:56,775
Barbara, I hope you'll stay with us.

297
00:29:57,417 --> 00:29:58,856
Oh, I don't know.

298
00:29:59,057 --> 00:30:02,097
All this luxury really isn't
my style, but...

299
00:30:02,855 --> 00:30:04,015
Yeah, I'd love to.

300
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,895
Then it's settled.

301
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:08,456
But, sir, we...

302
00:30:08,772 --> 00:30:10,853
we do get so busy here.

303
00:30:11,016 --> 00:30:12,091
Don't be silly.

304
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,855
After all, she's family.

305
00:30:30,571 --> 00:30:31,530
Uncle Alfred?

306
00:30:33,611 --> 00:30:35,338
I came to tuck you in.

307
00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:37,735
You came to tuck me in?

308
00:30:38,013 --> 00:30:39,653
That's quite a switch.

309
00:30:40,938 --> 00:30:42,339
What're you working on?

310
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:45,897
I'm trying to find my brother,
your Uncle Wilfred.

311
00:30:46,252 --> 00:30:49,858
He's first butler
to the Maharajah of Miranjapore.

312
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:52,898
But Miranjapore is a floating court.

313
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:54,816
It travels through India.

314
00:30:55,017 --> 00:30:56,772
I remember Mom getting postcards.

315
00:30:56,935 --> 00:30:59,975
So Wilfred can be
rather difficult to find.

316
00:31:01,251 --> 00:31:04,339
I don't suppose they have
fax machines on elephants.

317
00:31:06,094 --> 00:31:08,453
I've been trying to reach him
with no success.

318
00:31:09,297 --> 00:31:12,136
When one grows ancient,
one yearns for family.

319
00:31:14,371 --> 00:31:17,094
I have the same picture of Mom
by my bed.

320
00:31:17,411 --> 00:31:18,331
Peg?

321
00:31:18,571 --> 00:31:21,055
My nickname for sweet Margaret.

322
00:31:23,693 --> 00:31:25,735
It's good to see you again.

323
00:31:26,579 --> 00:31:27,653
I've missed you.

324
00:31:28,737 --> 00:31:30,530
As I have you.

325
00:31:31,816 --> 00:31:33,254
Sleep well, child.

326
00:31:34,491 --> 00:31:35,978
You sleep.

327
00:31:37,973 --> 00:31:39,651
Go to bed.

328
00:32:42,056 --> 00:32:43,331
Good morning, Gotham.

329
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:48,098
It's Gossip Gerty reporting to you
direct from the Gotham Observatory...

330
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:52,615
where billionaire Bruce Wayne,
chairman of Wayne Enterprises...

331
00:32:52,816 --> 00:32:57,573
is about to make yet another
legendary contribution to the city.

332
00:32:58,695 --> 00:33:01,093
Gotham Observatory, Bane.

333
00:33:01,611 --> 00:33:03,212
And step on it.

334
00:33:04,171 --> 00:33:05,456
Step.

335
00:33:13,896 --> 00:33:18,375
My father told me, to succeed,
we need only pick a star and follow it.

336
00:33:19,171 --> 00:33:23,131
So Wayne Enterprises is donating
the world's most advanced telescope...

337
00:33:23,371 --> 00:33:26,373
to Gotham's Observatory
Restoration Project.

338
00:33:26,574 --> 00:33:27,773
With any luck...

339
00:33:28,051 --> 00:33:30,775
this telescope will give
future generations a chance...

340
00:33:31,015 --> 00:33:32,933
to follow their own stars.

341
00:33:35,215 --> 00:33:36,174
Brucy...

342
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:40,212
Is it true that this new telescope
can see around the globe?

343
00:33:40,413 --> 00:33:43,012
Yes. If you'll watch
these monitors right here.

344
00:33:43,971 --> 00:33:48,498
Satellites in orbit allow us to reflect
light from anywhere on the planet.

345
00:33:48,939 --> 00:33:52,133
From here, we'll be able
to see the sky anywhere on earth...

346
00:33:52,334 --> 00:33:54,972
and through this
intricate network of satellites...

347
00:33:55,173 --> 00:33:59,335
reflect it back to our
very own Gotham City for observation.

348
00:34:00,131 --> 00:34:01,771
Just don't point it at my bedroom.

349
00:34:06,739 --> 00:34:09,415
Brucy, you and the exquisite
Julie Madison...

350
00:34:09,616 --> 00:34:11,093
have been going out forever.

351
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:13,414
Are you going to tie the knot?

352
00:34:13,615 --> 00:34:14,373
Marriage?

353
00:34:14,574 --> 00:34:16,454
Marriage?

354
00:34:16,617 --> 00:34:18,813
You want to give me a hand here?

355
00:34:19,331 --> 00:34:21,412
Bruce and I are recklessly in love.

356
00:34:21,575 --> 00:34:25,133
And that's most certainly
enough for us... for now.

357
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:29,372
If you will follow me,
I'll show you the central control grid.

358
00:34:29,775 --> 00:34:31,338
You're a lot of help.

359
00:34:33,055 --> 00:34:34,379
Miss, you need to stop.

360
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:35,779
Move, fascist bulldog!

361
00:34:35,932 --> 00:34:38,052
- You need an appointment...
- No, I don't!

362
00:34:38,253 --> 00:34:41,054
Miss, you're not authorized
to be up here.

363
00:34:41,255 --> 00:34:42,377
She has no pass, sir.

364
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:45,216
Little overly protective,
but you won't hurt me, Miss?

365
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:46,971
Dr. Pamela Isley.

366
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:48,294
Doctor...

367
00:34:48,611 --> 00:34:49,934
What can I do for you?

368
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:52,418
Actually, I already
work for you, or did.

369
00:34:52,658 --> 00:34:55,171
Your arboreal preservation project
in South America.

370
00:34:55,852 --> 00:34:58,853
We cut our funding.
There was a conflict of ideologies.

371
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:00,580
Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.

372
00:35:00,771 --> 00:35:01,855
I see you knew him.

373
00:35:02,095 --> 00:35:04,934
Yes. That lab burnt down last week.
I'm glad you escaped.

374
00:35:06,219 --> 00:35:10,218
I have here a proposal showing
how Wayne Enterprises can immediately...

375
00:35:10,371 --> 00:35:13,258
cease all actions
that toxify our environment.

376
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:15,656
Forget the stars,
look here at the earth...

377
00:35:15,857 --> 00:35:17,334
our mother, our womb.

378
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:20,499
She deserves your loyalty
and protection.

379
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,175
And yet, you spoil her lands...

380
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:24,891
poison her oceans...

381
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:26,253
blacken her skies!

382
00:35:26,531 --> 00:35:27,653
You're killing her!

383
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:32,094
Your intentions are noble,
but no diesel fuel for heat...

384
00:35:32,295 --> 00:35:36,937
no coolants to preserve food,
millions of people would die.

385
00:35:37,138 --> 00:35:39,737
Acceptable losses
in the battle to save the planet.

386
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:42,777
People come first, Dr. Isley.

387
00:35:44,772 --> 00:35:45,894
Mammals!

388
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,618
A day of reckoning is coming.

389
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:49,855
That's right.

390
00:35:50,018 --> 00:35:52,617
The same plants and flowers
that saw you...

391
00:35:53,653 --> 00:35:55,571
crawl from the primordial soup...

392
00:35:55,772 --> 00:35:59,896
will reclaim this planet
and there will be no one to protect you!

393
00:36:03,819 --> 00:36:05,852
You must be new in town.

394
00:36:06,053 --> 00:36:06,974
In Gotham City...

395
00:36:07,137 --> 00:36:09,372
Batman and Robin protect us...

396
00:36:09,573 --> 00:36:12,095
even from plants and flowers.

397
00:36:15,337 --> 00:36:17,092
Maybe you'd like to meet them.

398
00:36:17,696 --> 00:36:20,017
Caped crusaders are
going to help us auction...

399
00:36:20,218 --> 00:36:22,654
a diamond to raise money
for our botanical gardens.

400
00:36:23,335 --> 00:36:27,296
Just a few mammals doing what
we can for the world's plants.

401
00:36:27,651 --> 00:36:29,051
Thank you all for coming.

402
00:36:29,214 --> 00:36:30,451
Good day, Doctor.

403
00:36:39,495 --> 00:36:41,576
Batman and Robin...

404
00:36:42,056 --> 00:36:45,374
militant arm
of the warm-blooded oppressors...

405
00:36:46,132 --> 00:36:49,651
animal protectors of the status quo.

406
00:36:50,697 --> 00:36:52,097
First...

407
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,818
I'll rid myself of the fur
and feathered pests.

408
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,935
And then Gotham...

409
00:36:59,136 --> 00:37:00,575
will be mine...

410
00:37:00,776 --> 00:37:02,455
for the greening.

411
00:37:22,892 --> 00:37:24,052
Excuse me, chief.

412
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:26,814
I got something here
you might want to see.

413
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:36,059
I hate when people talk
during the movie.

414
00:37:54,655 --> 00:37:56,736
One more diamond, my love.

415
00:37:57,695 --> 00:37:59,335
One more.

416
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,532
Bruce Wayne. Diamonds.

417
00:38:10,853 --> 00:38:12,100
Very nice.

418
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:57,578
Ladies and gentlemen...

419
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,577
Gossip Gerty
of Good Morning Gotham and I...

420
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:05,778
welcome you
to the gem of the evening.

421
00:39:06,813 --> 00:39:09,096
Our own Commissioner Gordon...

422
00:39:09,537 --> 00:39:10,774
displaying...

423
00:39:10,976 --> 00:39:14,217
the famed Heart of Isis,
on loan...

424
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:18,773
from the collection of my
close personal friend, Bruce Wayne.

425
00:39:21,899 --> 00:39:23,491
Think Freeze will take the bait?

426
00:39:23,856 --> 00:39:25,179
He'll be here.

427
00:39:25,937 --> 00:39:28,497
...to dance with one
of our fabulous flowers...

428
00:39:28,651 --> 00:39:32,132
the famed diamond
draped around her neck.

429
00:39:34,654 --> 00:39:37,253
Let's start the bidding!

430
00:39:37,733 --> 00:39:40,178
I'll give 10,000 for the orchid!

431
00:39:42,173 --> 00:39:44,379
20,000 for the tiger lily!

432
00:39:46,374 --> 00:39:47,458
And I bid...

433
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:51,255
30,000 dollars
for the lovely magnolia!

434
00:39:56,492 --> 00:39:58,055
Boys, please...

435
00:39:58,419 --> 00:40:00,059
let's show some gusto!

436
00:42:02,059 --> 00:42:03,219
Hi, there.

437
00:42:03,977 --> 00:42:06,058
And you are?

438
00:42:06,451 --> 00:42:08,053
Poison...

439
00:42:08,254 --> 00:42:09,731
Poison Ivy.

440
00:42:19,897 --> 00:42:22,496
Why not send junior home early?

441
00:42:22,899 --> 00:42:26,054
I've got some wild oats to sow.

442
00:42:27,656 --> 00:42:29,372
On the other hand...

443
00:42:30,658 --> 00:42:33,333
youth does have its advantages.

444
00:42:34,053 --> 00:42:36,498
Endurance, stamina.

445
00:42:37,093 --> 00:42:39,375
Forget the geriatric Bat.

446
00:42:39,653 --> 00:42:41,140
Come, join me.

447
00:42:41,332 --> 00:42:43,499
My garden needs tending.

448
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:45,379
I'll take it from here, pal.

449
00:42:45,532 --> 00:42:47,613
Wouldn't you like the earrings too?

450
00:42:48,419 --> 00:42:52,572
Some lucky boy's
about to hit the honey pot.

451
00:42:52,859 --> 00:42:56,696
I'll include an evening of my company
for the winner.

452
00:42:57,415 --> 00:42:59,697
I'll bring everything you see here...

453
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:03,092
plus everything you don't.

454
00:43:04,819 --> 00:43:07,619
I bid 50,000 dollars for Poison Ivy!

455
00:43:11,292 --> 00:43:12,414
100,000!

456
00:43:13,738 --> 00:43:14,898
And I'll bid...

457
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,178
500,000 dollars!

458
00:43:19,971 --> 00:43:21,055
One million dollars.

459
00:43:22,657 --> 00:43:24,776
- 2 million.
- You don't have it. 3 million.

460
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:26,378
I'll borrow it from you. Four.

461
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,459
5 million.

462
00:43:28,612 --> 00:43:30,176
That's a utility belt, not a money belt.

463
00:43:30,377 --> 00:43:31,336
6 million.

464
00:43:31,499 --> 00:43:32,372
7 million.

465
00:43:35,776 --> 00:43:37,177
Never leave the cave without it.

466
00:43:37,455 --> 00:43:40,773
You boys aren't going to start fighting
over little old me, now are you?

467
00:43:53,979 --> 00:43:56,137
All right, everyone!
Chill.

468
00:43:57,374 --> 00:43:58,218
Chill.

469
00:44:07,137 --> 00:44:08,058
Get the gun!

470
00:44:50,294 --> 00:44:51,857
Look at you!

471
00:44:52,059 --> 00:44:53,852
Let me guess.

472
00:44:54,456 --> 00:44:55,655
Plant Girl?

473
00:44:56,019 --> 00:44:57,736
Vine Lady?

474
00:44:58,455 --> 00:45:00,613
Hand over the diamond, Garden Gal...

475
00:45:00,776 --> 00:45:02,531
or I'll turn you into mulch.

476
00:45:07,336 --> 00:45:08,736
Pheromone dust...

477
00:45:09,695 --> 00:45:10,894
designed to heat...

478
00:45:11,096 --> 00:45:12,419
a man's blood.

479
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,171
Doesn't work on the cold-hearted.
If you please!

480
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,097
If you insist.

481
00:45:21,492 --> 00:45:23,860
Clever little clover.

482
00:45:27,773 --> 00:45:29,854
That's my exit cue.

483
00:45:30,296 --> 00:45:31,494
Thanks.

484
00:45:42,456 --> 00:45:43,492
Good night.

485
00:45:45,573 --> 00:45:47,136
Cool party!

486
00:46:13,539 --> 00:46:16,579
Commissioner, you have 11 minutes
to thaw these people.

487
00:46:22,861 --> 00:46:26,620
Miss Ivy, you've just met
one of the most sinister men in Gotham.

488
00:46:27,013 --> 00:46:28,931
That's not a man...

489
00:46:29,094 --> 00:46:31,012
that is a god.

490
00:46:36,891 --> 00:46:38,733
Enough monkey business.

491
00:46:39,577 --> 00:46:41,696
We've got work to do.

492
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,055
Monkey work.

493
00:47:32,736 --> 00:47:34,060
You can't make the jump.

494
00:47:34,252 --> 00:47:35,335
I can!

495
00:47:37,973 --> 00:47:38,692
Pull back!

496
00:47:39,133 --> 00:47:40,140
I can make it!

497
00:47:40,332 --> 00:47:41,857
Redbird control codes.

498
00:47:44,734 --> 00:47:45,981
Disable engine.

499
00:47:47,812 --> 00:47:48,973
Don't do it to me!

500
00:47:56,933 --> 00:47:58,132
We won't make it!

501
00:48:20,257 --> 00:48:22,300
It's a cold town.

502
00:48:52,413 --> 00:48:53,852
I could've made that jump.

503
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,815
You could've splattered your brains
on the building's side.

504
00:48:56,978 --> 00:48:58,618
The Flying Graysons were a team.

505
00:48:58,858 --> 00:49:00,700
We had to trust each to do his job.

506
00:49:00,853 --> 00:49:02,819
That's what being partners is about.

507
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,332
Counting on someone is the way to win.

508
00:49:05,533 --> 00:49:07,739
Your head wasn't on the job.
It was on Poison Ivy.

509
00:49:08,295 --> 00:49:10,376
Maybe she wanted me instead of you.

510
00:49:10,578 --> 00:49:12,256
That's your idea of friendship?

511
00:49:12,419 --> 00:49:14,980
It's your rules.
It's your way, or the highway.

512
00:49:15,171 --> 00:49:17,694
It's Batman and Robin,
not Robin and Batman.

513
00:49:17,895 --> 00:49:20,935
- I'm sick of it!
- Yes, it's my rules that keep us alive.

514
00:49:21,098 --> 00:49:24,340
If you want to stay in this house,
on this team, you'll abide by them.

515
00:49:25,452 --> 00:49:26,939
This is no partnership.

516
00:49:27,179 --> 00:49:28,617
You're never going to trust me!

517
00:49:35,177 --> 00:49:36,817
Dear brother Wilfred...

518
00:49:37,373 --> 00:49:41,094
I have tried every address
I know for you.

519
00:49:41,257 --> 00:49:43,655
I'm just praying this reaches you.

520
00:49:44,461 --> 00:49:45,899
We have very little time.

521
00:50:01,781 --> 00:50:04,178
Batman monopolized the evening news.

522
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,859
Congratulations on your
apprehension of Mr. Freeze.

523
00:50:09,012 --> 00:50:10,537
Thanks.
Thank you.

524
00:50:13,894 --> 00:50:15,495
Is there something wrong, sir?

525
00:50:18,535 --> 00:50:20,099
Am I pig-headed?

526
00:50:22,659 --> 00:50:24,136
Is it always...

527
00:50:24,299 --> 00:50:26,217
my way or the highway?

528
00:50:26,658 --> 00:50:28,260
Why, yes actually.

529
00:50:29,372 --> 00:50:32,978
Death and chance stole your parents...

530
00:50:33,218 --> 00:50:35,175
but rather than become a victim...

531
00:50:35,414 --> 00:50:39,174
you have done everything
in your power to control the fates.

532
00:50:39,778 --> 00:50:41,696
For what is Batman...

533
00:50:41,974 --> 00:50:46,415
if not an effort to master the chaos
that sweeps our world?

534
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:49,138
An attempt to control...

535
00:50:49,292 --> 00:50:50,932
death itself?

536
00:51:09,978 --> 00:51:11,455
But I can't, can I?

537
00:51:13,172 --> 00:51:14,773
None of us can.

538
00:51:39,737 --> 00:51:41,933
Sorry. So sorry!

539
00:51:42,173 --> 00:51:43,535
Teach you that at Oxbridge?

540
00:51:43,736 --> 00:51:47,899
Just a few judo lessons.
You know, London's kind of rough.

541
00:51:48,215 --> 00:51:50,536
I suppose you had
a minor in motorbikes also?

542
00:51:52,819 --> 00:51:54,420
Couldn't resist.

543
00:51:54,574 --> 00:51:55,897
It's just so beautiful.

544
00:51:56,856 --> 00:51:59,532
I just took it out for a spin.
I'll clean it tomorrow.

545
00:51:59,896 --> 00:52:00,817
All right?

546
00:52:01,018 --> 00:52:02,140
Sorry.

547
00:52:02,773 --> 00:52:04,576
Sorry.
Good night.

548
00:52:48,136 --> 00:52:50,217
Drag him into the cold beam.

549
00:52:52,059 --> 00:52:53,852
Welcome home, Frost Face.

550
00:52:54,053 --> 00:52:56,940
You're the common cold,
and we are the cure.

551
00:52:59,136 --> 00:53:01,620
Allow me to break the ice.

552
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,941
My name is Freeze.

553
00:53:04,219 --> 00:53:05,898
Learn it well...

554
00:53:06,137 --> 00:53:08,861
for it's the chilling sound
of your doom.

555
00:53:20,254 --> 00:53:24,532
All right, Freezie, you can't live
outside the cold zone.

556
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,297
Look at him stew.

557
00:53:39,301 --> 00:53:40,653
Get used to it.

558
00:53:40,855 --> 00:53:43,617
You're going to be here a very long...

559
00:53:43,818 --> 00:53:45,496
long time.

560
00:53:46,858 --> 00:53:48,335
Sadly...

561
00:53:48,536 --> 00:53:50,819
you will not live to see it.

562
00:54:02,212 --> 00:54:05,655
Batface and Birdbrain turned out
to be much more resistant...

563
00:54:05,857 --> 00:54:08,101
to my love dust
than expected.

564
00:54:08,293 --> 00:54:12,138
No matter. Next time
I'll just give them a stronger dose.

565
00:54:12,378 --> 00:54:15,294
They'll literally be dying for me.

566
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,334
Turkish baths.

567
00:54:18,535 --> 00:54:20,377
This looks promising.

568
00:54:46,539 --> 00:54:48,333
A fixer-upper.

569
00:54:48,975 --> 00:54:50,980
But with a certain homey charm.

570
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:53,857
A minus!

571
00:54:54,135 --> 00:54:55,813
Current tenants.

572
00:54:55,976 --> 00:54:58,815
Hello, my little pretty, pretty, pretty.

573
00:54:58,978 --> 00:55:00,695
Hello, yourself.

574
00:55:01,299 --> 00:55:02,814
You look good enough to eat.

575
00:55:03,457 --> 00:55:05,212
That I am.

576
00:55:05,701 --> 00:55:08,453
Come and get me,
if you can.

577
00:55:11,139 --> 00:55:12,740
With pleasure.

578
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:33,820
Let's redecorate.

579
00:55:42,614 --> 00:55:45,741
I've always hankered
for something on the water.

580
00:55:53,854 --> 00:55:55,772
What is this floor?

581
00:56:02,773 --> 00:56:04,778
It took God seven days...

582
00:56:04,941 --> 00:56:07,012
to create Paradise.

583
00:56:07,492 --> 00:56:10,100
Let's see if I can do better.

584
00:56:16,296 --> 00:56:18,214
Good babies.

585
00:56:18,655 --> 00:56:19,700
Grow for mommy.

586
00:56:25,455 --> 00:56:26,893
Bane, darling...

587
00:56:27,095 --> 00:56:30,336
I found a fellow
who strikes my fancy.

588
00:56:30,538 --> 00:56:32,619
A cool customer, yes.

589
00:56:33,655 --> 00:56:35,496
Icy demeanor...

590
00:56:36,014 --> 00:56:37,500
no question.

591
00:56:38,296 --> 00:56:41,854
But I detect a certain ruthless charm
I may be able to use...

592
00:56:42,056 --> 00:56:43,897
to my advantage.

593
00:56:44,741 --> 00:56:47,215
Honey, clean up this mess.

594
00:56:47,378 --> 00:56:49,297
We've got company coming.

595
00:56:50,093 --> 00:56:51,013
Honey.

596
00:56:51,656 --> 00:56:52,778
Company.

597
00:57:05,619 --> 00:57:08,938
We've been going out
for over a year now, and...

598
00:57:10,213 --> 00:57:11,460
Okay, here it goes.

599
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:13,896
I want to spend my life with you.

600
00:57:16,936 --> 00:57:18,701
I'm not the marrying kind.

601
00:57:18,854 --> 00:57:21,655
There are things about me
you wouldn't understand.

602
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:24,819
I know you're a dedicated bachelor.

603
00:57:25,021 --> 00:57:26,459
You've had your wild nights.

604
00:57:27,092 --> 00:57:28,540
Wild doesn't...

605
00:57:29,336 --> 00:57:30,737
quite cover it.

606
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:34,659
You'll make someone
a good husband one day...

607
00:57:35,014 --> 00:57:36,337
but I can't wait forever.

608
00:57:41,334 --> 00:57:43,981
Look, I don't want to pressure you.
Because if I do...

609
00:57:44,134 --> 00:57:46,100
you'll just shut down.

610
00:57:46,532 --> 00:57:48,019
I know the way you are.

611
00:57:49,572 --> 00:57:51,260
Think about it.

612
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,581
Just promise me you'll think about it.

613
00:57:54,454 --> 00:57:55,259
Okay?

614
00:57:56,736 --> 00:57:58,415
You don't have to answer now.

615
00:57:58,779 --> 00:57:59,815
Just...

616
00:57:59,978 --> 00:58:01,253
think it over.

617
00:58:01,455 --> 00:58:03,219
Here's food for thought.

618
00:58:21,336 --> 00:58:22,496
Who's Ivy?

619
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:26,457
You just called me Ivy.

620
00:58:26,697 --> 00:58:27,972
Who's Ivy?

621
00:58:29,133 --> 00:58:30,456
I wish I knew.

622
00:58:32,537 --> 00:58:34,858
Enhance detail 14 to 19.

623
00:58:39,855 --> 00:58:41,495
Who are you?

624
00:58:54,854 --> 00:58:56,015
Gotcha!

625
00:59:42,058 --> 00:59:43,660
Banker, how much coin to play?

626
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:44,897
2 1/2.

627
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:47,860
You're the chick who won
the tunnel run 2 nights ago!

628
00:59:48,052 --> 00:59:49,059
That'd be me.

629
00:59:49,261 --> 00:59:51,495
That was kid stuff, sweetheart.

630
00:59:51,735 --> 00:59:54,497
Why don't you take your tricycle
and run home?

631
00:59:55,494 --> 00:59:57,173
- Want a side bet?
- How much?

632
00:59:57,374 --> 00:59:59,014
- How much you got?
- How much you got?

633
00:59:59,177 --> 01:00:02,294
All right, let's race! Come on!

634
01:00:09,899 --> 01:00:13,093
Just make sure the guys are ready
at the end of the bridge.

635
01:00:14,215 --> 01:00:15,500
You got it, Spike!

636
01:01:22,019 --> 01:01:23,812
Out of my way, losers!

637
01:01:25,059 --> 01:01:26,258
Nice try, girlie!

638
01:01:26,459 --> 01:01:27,658
You're next!

639
01:01:29,615 --> 01:01:31,015
Excuse me!

640
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:35,896
Look out, baby!

641
01:01:54,099 --> 01:01:56,218
Not bad, for a chick!

642
01:02:28,222 --> 01:02:29,133
Now!

643
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:44,497
End of the line, sweetheart!

644
01:03:09,901 --> 01:03:11,417
So this is where you hang out.

645
01:03:15,819 --> 01:03:17,018
How long you been racing?

646
01:03:17,181 --> 01:03:19,137
Since my parents died.

647
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:23,136
I guess all the speed and danger
helped take me out of myself.

648
01:03:23,338 --> 01:03:25,016
Made the pain go away.

649
01:03:25,572 --> 01:03:27,135
You wouldn't understand.

650
01:03:27,337 --> 01:03:28,737
You'd be surprised.

651
01:03:29,101 --> 01:03:33,532
Street racing isn't exactly
an acceptable major at Oxbridge so...

652
01:03:33,695 --> 01:03:35,134
they kicked me out.

653
01:03:35,374 --> 01:03:38,893
But I've already won the money I need
to do what I've always dreamed.

654
01:03:39,095 --> 01:03:41,099
Don't say you want to join the circus.

655
01:03:42,058 --> 01:03:45,981
Alfred has supported me my whole life
and I'm going to pay him back.

656
01:03:46,815 --> 01:03:49,414
I'll take him away
from this dismal life of servitude.

657
01:03:50,181 --> 01:03:51,620
What are you talking about?

658
01:03:51,773 --> 01:03:54,459
Listen, this whole
master-servant thing...

659
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:55,974
it's really ridiculous.

660
01:03:56,175 --> 01:03:58,333
Alfred is a sweet, noble man...

661
01:03:58,496 --> 01:04:01,901
and he's subjugated all his life
and dreams to someone else.

662
01:04:02,093 --> 01:04:03,972
Alfred and Bruce are like family.

663
01:04:05,056 --> 01:04:07,137
Paying someone to prepare your meals...

664
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:10,100
do laundry, clean dishes,
you call that family?

665
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:11,654
Alfred's happy.

666
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:13,256
Happy?

667
01:04:13,898 --> 01:04:16,181
You honestly don't know, do you?

668
01:04:16,373 --> 01:04:18,780
How he's hiding the pain all the time.

669
01:04:19,499 --> 01:04:20,775
Alfred's sick.

670
01:04:24,218 --> 01:04:26,059
Alfred's not sick.

671
01:04:26,337 --> 01:04:27,661
He's dying.

672
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:31,420
Dying?

673
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:36,100
Why didn't he tell us?

674
01:04:36,618 --> 01:04:39,217
You know Alfred,
he'd never say anything.

675
01:04:45,221 --> 01:04:46,496
But I can tell.

676
01:04:51,253 --> 01:04:53,018
I can't believe it.

677
01:04:54,341 --> 01:04:55,300
I know.

678
01:05:42,015 --> 01:05:43,693
Icehead, you got a visitor.

679
01:05:44,221 --> 01:05:46,542
Your sister is here to see you.

680
01:05:46,695 --> 01:05:47,894
Sister?

681
01:05:51,855 --> 01:05:53,696
Brother, dear...

682
01:05:54,339 --> 01:05:56,458
I heard you were blue.

683
01:05:58,654 --> 01:06:00,937
Don't mind us, ma'am.

684
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:03,018
You can speak freely.

685
01:06:05,579 --> 01:06:07,976
I don't mind you at all.

686
01:06:11,774 --> 01:06:12,973
Men...

687
01:06:13,299 --> 01:06:15,936
the most absurd of God's creatures.

688
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:17,413
We give you life...

689
01:06:18,056 --> 01:06:21,336
and we can take it away
just as easily.

690
01:06:21,499 --> 01:06:23,657
- Right!
- Whatever.

691
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:27,416
I really am to die for.

692
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:55,660
Impressive!

693
01:06:56,782 --> 01:06:59,899
Well, I, my most
unabominable snowman...

694
01:07:00,455 --> 01:07:02,737
have been impressed by you.

695
01:07:02,939 --> 01:07:04,301
In fact...

696
01:07:04,454 --> 01:07:06,813
I propose a pairing.

697
01:07:16,538 --> 01:07:18,533
I've come to set you free.

698
01:07:19,454 --> 01:07:21,218
An enticing offer...

699
01:07:21,861 --> 01:07:22,820
but...

700
01:07:22,973 --> 01:07:25,054
what does the lady want in return?

701
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:31,020
Let's cool it for now.
I've got someone I want you to meet.

702
01:07:38,174 --> 01:07:40,380
His name is Bane.

703
01:07:40,936 --> 01:07:43,138
A laundry service that delivers!

704
01:07:48,733 --> 01:07:51,495
What are you,
about a 50, big and tall?

705
01:07:51,898 --> 01:07:55,619
No, I always go a size smaller.
Makes me look slimmer.

706
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:02,419
I'm running on empty.

707
01:08:02,658 --> 01:08:04,097
I need the diamonds.

708
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:06,341
I'll help you grab your rocks.

709
01:08:09,573 --> 01:08:10,618
Bane...

710
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:12,019
dear...

711
01:08:12,258 --> 01:08:13,735
an exit, please.

712
01:08:19,336 --> 01:08:21,014
Reinforced steel.

713
01:08:21,216 --> 01:08:22,300
Not good.

714
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:34,978
Always winterize your pipes.

715
01:08:50,457 --> 01:08:54,255
While I get my diamonds,
you and meatloaf retrieve my wife.

716
01:08:54,495 --> 01:08:56,461
You never mentioned a wife!

717
01:08:56,614 --> 01:08:57,573
Come on.

718
01:08:57,736 --> 01:08:59,577
I hope Mr. Bane can swim.

719
01:09:17,253 --> 01:09:19,180
Alfred, are you well?

720
01:09:19,497 --> 01:09:21,894
As well as can be expected, sir.

721
01:09:23,937 --> 01:09:25,414
My friend, I know you're sick.

722
01:09:25,615 --> 01:09:27,342
I can get you the best doctors.

723
01:09:27,533 --> 01:09:30,094
I have seen the best doctors.

724
01:09:30,535 --> 01:09:35,014
A gentleman does not discuss
his ailments. It is not civilized.

725
01:09:35,455 --> 01:09:39,493
I hope that I have taught you
at least that much, Master Bruce.

726
01:09:42,734 --> 01:09:44,096
Have you ever...

727
01:09:44,298 --> 01:09:46,695
regretted your life working here?

728
01:09:47,501 --> 01:09:48,853
Looking after heroes?

729
01:09:49,054 --> 01:09:50,301
No, sir.

730
01:09:51,222 --> 01:09:55,173
My only regret is that I was never
able to be out there with you.

731
01:09:58,539 --> 01:10:00,860
Not all the heroes wear masks.

732
01:10:04,898 --> 01:10:06,097
Freeze has escaped!

733
01:10:19,341 --> 01:10:21,815
We got this off
the Arkham surveillance camera.

734
01:10:24,942 --> 01:10:26,217
Poison Ivy.

735
01:10:27,819 --> 01:10:28,778
2 nights ago...

736
01:10:29,018 --> 01:10:32,854
Gotham Airport, these two arrive
by charter from South America.

737
01:10:33,218 --> 01:10:36,057
They put 10 security guards
in the hospital...

738
01:10:36,297 --> 01:10:40,622
left a businessman dead from
organic poisoning, stole his limousine.

739
01:10:40,814 --> 01:10:43,979
This is definitely the same pair
that sprang Freeze.

740
01:10:45,139 --> 01:10:46,501
Excuse me, gentlemen.

741
01:10:47,374 --> 01:10:49,733
Poison Ivy...
why would she help Freeze?

742
01:10:49,934 --> 01:10:51,421
She's definitely evil.

743
01:10:51,661 --> 01:10:54,298
She was all I could think about,
like I was in love.

744
01:10:54,538 --> 01:10:56,580
I know, then the feeling vanished.

745
01:10:56,782 --> 01:10:58,978
I can't believe
we fought over a bad guy.

746
01:10:59,179 --> 01:11:01,414
Bad, yes. Guy, no.

747
01:11:01,615 --> 01:11:03,294
Well, I'm totally over her.

748
01:11:03,495 --> 01:11:05,135
Me too. Definitely.

749
01:11:06,056 --> 01:11:08,137
- Great stems though.
- Buds too.

750
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:09,259
Those are nice.

751
01:11:09,422 --> 01:11:10,496
Here we go.

752
01:11:16,413 --> 01:11:17,535
It's Nora Fries.

753
01:11:17,737 --> 01:11:19,022
She's still alive.

754
01:11:34,376 --> 01:11:37,100
He adapted his freezing technology
to reverse the disease.

755
01:11:37,253 --> 01:11:39,814
He found a cure for the disease
in some stages.

756
01:11:40,773 --> 01:11:41,742
There she is.

757
01:11:42,979 --> 01:11:45,213
Get the diamonds.
I'll rescue the bride.

758
01:11:45,453 --> 01:11:47,496
We'll meet back at my place.

759
01:11:48,301 --> 01:11:51,495
In my weakened condition,
I'm no match for the Bat and Bird.

760
01:11:51,658 --> 01:11:54,094
You leave those boys to me.

761
01:11:54,535 --> 01:11:55,494
Go!

762
01:11:57,940 --> 01:12:00,539
- Can he save her?
- Her case is too advanced.

763
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:02,054
But maybe someday...

764
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:03,819
with more research...

765
01:12:10,014 --> 01:12:11,338
Poison Ivy.

766
01:12:21,053 --> 01:12:23,096
I hate uninvited guests.

767
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:31,535
My lungs are freezing!

768
01:12:43,935 --> 01:12:44,895
Chilled...

769
01:12:45,096 --> 01:12:46,218
to perfection.

770
01:12:53,142 --> 01:12:54,101
No beauty.

771
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:58,417
Just the beast.

772
01:13:17,579 --> 01:13:19,535
Hey there, pretty birdie.

773
01:13:19,736 --> 01:13:21,578
Give yourself up. If you surrender...

774
01:13:21,779 --> 01:13:22,853
To you?

775
01:13:24,781 --> 01:13:26,699
Polly want a kiss?

776
01:13:38,534 --> 01:13:42,734
There's something about
an anatomically correct...

777
01:13:42,936 --> 01:13:46,858
rubber suit that puts fire
in a girl's lips.

778
01:13:50,061 --> 01:13:53,418
Why are all the gorgeous ones
homicidal maniacs? Is it me?

779
01:13:53,581 --> 01:13:54,502
Enough...

780
01:13:54,655 --> 01:13:56,218
sweet talk.

781
01:13:59,019 --> 01:14:02,222
First you'll tell me where Freeze is,
then you're going to jail.

782
01:14:06,336 --> 01:14:07,775
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

783
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:11,179
That's why every Poison Ivy
Action Figure comes with him!

784
01:14:14,536 --> 01:14:17,298
Try not to make a mess when you die.

785
01:14:47,019 --> 01:14:48,141
Hold it right there!

786
01:15:08,933 --> 01:15:10,218
Stop!

787
01:15:12,414 --> 01:15:15,934
Living in the shadow
of the big, bad Bat.

788
01:15:16,135 --> 01:15:17,938
You don't need him.

789
01:15:18,696 --> 01:15:20,739
You're the star.

790
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:22,657
I can see it now.

791
01:15:22,858 --> 01:15:26,857
Your own big, bright signal in the sky.

792
01:15:27,653 --> 01:15:29,581
Let me guide you.

793
01:15:37,896 --> 01:15:39,661
Let me kiss you.

794
01:15:39,814 --> 01:15:41,262
Stop! Don't kiss her.

795
01:15:41,895 --> 01:15:44,619
The victim at the airport,
toxins introduced orally.

796
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:47,342
- What are you saying?
- Why does she want to kiss us?

797
01:15:47,534 --> 01:15:49,817
- I bet her lips are poisoned.
- Poisoned kiss?

798
01:15:50,018 --> 01:15:51,342
You have issues with women!

799
01:15:51,533 --> 01:15:53,854
You can't stand that
she'd kiss me and not you.

800
01:15:54,094 --> 01:15:56,137
Something would be mine, not yours.

801
01:16:06,178 --> 01:16:07,214
Exit, Bane.

802
01:16:07,617 --> 01:16:09,055
Exit!

803
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,060
Ivy's right. I don't need your help.

804
01:16:24,294 --> 01:16:25,896
I'm going solo!

805
01:16:28,418 --> 01:16:29,502
What happened?

806
01:16:29,694 --> 01:16:31,295
How'd they get away?

807
01:16:48,021 --> 01:16:50,860
I've never been good with competition.

808
01:16:52,816 --> 01:16:55,818
Who needs a frigid wife anyway?

809
01:17:19,813 --> 01:17:21,616
Make yourself right at home.

810
01:17:23,937 --> 01:17:25,098
Where's my wife?

811
01:17:25,539 --> 01:17:28,454
There was nothing I could do.
Batman deactivated her.

812
01:17:28,895 --> 01:17:31,015
- She's dead.
- You lie!

813
01:17:54,818 --> 01:17:56,333
I'm sorry.

814
01:17:58,501 --> 01:18:01,301
Their bones will turn to ice!

815
01:18:03,334 --> 01:18:05,933
Their blood will freeze in my hands!

816
01:18:06,739 --> 01:18:08,063
Kill them, of course.

817
01:18:08,254 --> 01:18:10,057
But why stop there?

818
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:13,376
Why should only
Batman and Robin die...

819
01:18:13,577 --> 01:18:16,819
while the society that created them
goes unpunished?

820
01:18:17,058 --> 01:18:18,660
Yes!

821
01:18:18,861 --> 01:18:20,942
If I must suffer...

822
01:18:21,134 --> 01:18:23,935
humanity will suffer with me!

823
01:18:24,136 --> 01:18:28,816
I shall repay them for sentencing me
to a life without human comfort.

824
01:18:29,382 --> 01:18:32,662
I will blanket the city
in endless winter!

825
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:34,062
First...

826
01:18:35,501 --> 01:18:36,661
Gotham.

827
01:18:37,735 --> 01:18:39,222
And then...

828
01:18:39,653 --> 01:18:40,737
the world!

829
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:43,816
Just what I had in mind.

830
01:18:45,062 --> 01:18:48,102
Everything dead on earth except us.

831
01:18:48,294 --> 01:18:49,742
A chance for...

832
01:18:49,934 --> 01:18:52,658
Mother Nature to start again.

833
01:18:52,974 --> 01:18:53,857
Behold...

834
01:18:54,058 --> 01:18:56,657
the dawn of a new age.

835
01:18:59,975 --> 01:19:03,016
My mutant plants have the strength
of the deadliest animals.

836
01:19:03,821 --> 01:19:08,022
Once you have frozen mankind,
these babies will overrun the globe.

837
01:19:08,981 --> 01:19:10,698
And we shall rule them.

838
01:19:12,299 --> 01:19:13,738
For we will be...

839
01:19:13,939 --> 01:19:16,413
the only two people left
in the world.

840
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:18,859
Yes.

841
01:19:19,175 --> 01:19:20,461
Adam...

842
01:19:21,899 --> 01:19:23,136
and Evil.

843
01:19:24,776 --> 01:19:26,656
You distract the Bat and Bird...

844
01:19:26,819 --> 01:19:28,296
while I prepare...

845
01:19:28,497 --> 01:19:29,782
to freeze...

846
01:19:30,022 --> 01:19:31,374
Gotham!

847
01:19:45,213 --> 01:19:48,254
It's Stage 1 of MacGregor's Syndrome.

848
01:19:48,781 --> 01:19:49,855
I'm sorry.

849
01:19:50,939 --> 01:19:53,663
All we can do is
make him comfortable.

850
01:19:56,099 --> 01:19:57,374
Thank you, Doctor.

851
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:16,459
MacGregor's Syndrome is
what Fries' wife had.

852
01:20:16,977 --> 01:20:19,499
Alfred's condition is less severe.
Fries' research said...

853
01:20:19,739 --> 01:20:22,060
he cured a case like it,
just didn't say how.

854
01:20:22,261 --> 01:20:24,055
No one else is even close.

855
01:20:24,256 --> 01:20:27,737
I'm late for the dedication,
then I go after Freeze and Ivy alone.

856
01:20:27,939 --> 01:20:30,097
- Like hell you do.
- Don't push me right now.

857
01:20:30,298 --> 01:20:33,415
Or what? No one can capture Ivy
but the big, bad Bat?

858
01:20:33,616 --> 01:20:34,335
Right.

859
01:20:34,853 --> 01:20:36,301
You want her for yourself.

860
01:20:36,493 --> 01:20:39,975
I want her so badly, I can taste it.
That's the whole point.

861
01:20:40,780 --> 01:20:45,019
She's done something to us.
She has us fighting over her somehow.

862
01:20:45,221 --> 01:20:48,500
I know she loves me and not you,
and it's driving you crazy.

863
01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:51,023
That's why you
stopped us from kissing.

864
01:20:51,176 --> 01:20:53,775
- You're not thinking straight.
- But I am.

865
01:20:54,821 --> 01:20:56,662
For the first time in a long time.

866
01:20:56,902 --> 01:20:59,261
I want a Robin signal
in the sky, all right?

867
01:20:59,462 --> 01:21:01,342
I'm tired of living
in your shadow.

868
01:21:01,534 --> 01:21:02,694
All that ends now.

869
01:21:07,576 --> 01:21:09,302
I'm sorry, Uncle.

870
01:21:10,539 --> 01:21:12,179
I was too late.

871
01:21:22,575 --> 01:21:25,174
You must do something for me.

872
01:21:27,217 --> 01:21:29,097
Find my brother, Wilfred...

873
01:21:29,298 --> 01:21:31,696
your uncle,
wherever he is, and give him...

874
01:21:31,935 --> 01:21:32,942
this.

875
01:21:33,134 --> 01:21:36,779
I have duties
that he must fulfill in my stead.

876
01:21:38,102 --> 01:21:40,461
Only family can be trusted.

877
01:21:41,334 --> 01:21:42,495
What is it?

878
01:21:43,022 --> 01:21:46,302
It is a sacred trust of two good men...

879
01:21:46,494 --> 01:21:49,457
whom I have the honor
of calling son.

880
01:21:52,258 --> 01:21:53,495
Take it to Wilfred...

881
01:21:53,658 --> 01:21:55,221
and I implore you...

882
01:21:56,094 --> 01:21:57,494
never open it.

883
01:22:00,774 --> 01:22:03,699
You look so like your mother.

884
01:22:07,094 --> 01:22:09,779
Bonsoir, glamorous Gothamites.

885
01:22:09,981 --> 01:22:11,822
Everyone who's anyone...

886
01:22:11,975 --> 01:22:13,654
has flocked to the observatory...

887
01:22:13,817 --> 01:22:17,816
and tonight's star-studded
dedication of the new telescope.

888
01:22:22,458 --> 01:22:25,776
And here's the man
of the hour himself...

889
01:22:26,016 --> 01:22:27,934
Bruce Wayne.

890
01:22:30,974 --> 01:22:32,134
Excuse me.

891
01:22:34,858 --> 01:22:35,817
Commissioner.

892
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:37,419
- How are you?
- Good. You know Julie?

893
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:38,819
How are you?

894
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:40,258
Good to see you.

895
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:43,662
Young man.

896
01:22:45,379 --> 01:22:46,980
Lovely to see you again.

897
01:22:52,054 --> 01:22:53,176
Thank you.

898
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:55,334
Commissioner Gordon...

899
01:22:57,779 --> 01:22:59,419
I've always wondered...

900
01:22:59,621 --> 01:23:03,217
where does that big,
old Batlight come from?

901
01:23:08,895 --> 01:23:10,218
Why...

902
01:23:10,381 --> 01:23:11,177
it's...

903
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:13,421
on top of Police Headquarters.

904
01:23:14,294 --> 01:23:15,454
I'd just...

905
01:23:15,694 --> 01:23:17,219
love to see it.

906
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:19,818
But you probably don't have access.

907
01:23:19,981 --> 01:23:21,180
Why, dear lady...

908
01:23:22,216 --> 01:23:24,536
I am the police commissioner.

909
01:23:24,738 --> 01:23:27,577
I have the keys
right here in my pocket.

910
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:29,217
Would you like to see it?

911
01:23:47,016 --> 01:23:49,894
Who are you, dear lady?

912
01:23:52,617 --> 01:23:55,418
On second thought,
you're way too old for me.

913
01:23:55,581 --> 01:23:57,221
No, I'm not.

914
01:23:58,343 --> 01:23:59,743
Please...

915
01:23:59,935 --> 01:24:01,498
come back.

916
01:24:07,943 --> 01:24:09,899
What are you doing? Come on.

917
01:24:10,657 --> 01:24:12,939
Show me how the satellites work.

918
01:24:25,858 --> 01:24:26,855
First...

919
01:24:27,056 --> 01:24:30,058
I will turn Gotham into
an icy graveyard...

920
01:24:30,221 --> 01:24:31,056
then...

921
01:24:31,257 --> 01:24:34,096
I will pull Batman's heart
from his body...

922
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:36,858
and feel it freeze in my hands.

923
01:24:41,221 --> 01:24:42,094
Revenge!

924
01:24:43,494 --> 01:24:45,019
Quickly, Bane.

925
01:24:45,221 --> 01:24:46,381
Quickly now.

926
01:24:59,299 --> 01:25:01,294
Let there be light.

927
01:25:07,374 --> 01:25:09,657
Only family can be trusted?

928
01:25:12,496 --> 01:25:13,579
I'm family.

930
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:27,457
Access denied.

931
01:25:48,776 --> 01:25:51,740
I spend my entire life
trying to beat back death.

932
01:25:55,816 --> 01:25:58,223
Everything I've done,
everything I'm...

933
01:25:58,856 --> 01:26:00,774
capable of doing...

934
01:26:04,102 --> 01:26:05,981
But I can't save you.

935
01:26:07,094 --> 01:26:09,981
There's no defeat in death...

936
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:12,138
Master Bruce.

937
01:26:13,539 --> 01:26:16,377
Victory comes in defending...

938
01:26:16,579 --> 01:26:18,698
what we know is right...

939
01:26:19,139 --> 01:26:21,499
while we still live.

940
01:26:49,541 --> 01:26:51,056
I love you, old man.

941
01:26:54,461 --> 01:26:57,137
And I love you too.

943
01:27:21,257 --> 01:27:23,376
This better be one hell of a secret.

944
01:27:31,499 --> 01:27:32,698
Margaret.

945
01:27:48,781 --> 01:27:50,181
Peg.

946
01:27:54,535 --> 01:27:56,262
Access allowed.

947
01:28:23,863 --> 01:28:26,855
The combined power of
the telescope's reflecting crystals...

948
01:28:27,056 --> 01:28:28,054
will complete...

949
01:28:28,217 --> 01:28:29,857
my freezing engine.

950
01:28:33,415 --> 01:28:36,100
No matter what
they tell you, Mr. Bane...

951
01:28:36,340 --> 01:28:38,862
it is the size of
your gun that counts.

952
01:28:48,174 --> 01:28:49,181
Where are you going?

953
01:28:49,335 --> 01:28:52,183
It's not a Batlight, it's a Robin signal.
Ivy's calling me.

954
01:28:52,337 --> 01:28:53,497
Her name's Pamela Isley.

955
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:56,374
She must've stolen Gordon's keys
and changed the signal.

956
01:28:56,537 --> 01:28:57,899
She did it for me, for love.

957
01:28:58,062 --> 01:28:59,856
She infected us with pheromones.

958
01:29:00,057 --> 01:29:02,301
I'm under some kind of magic spell?

959
01:29:02,502 --> 01:29:03,615
She wants to kill you.

960
01:29:03,903 --> 01:29:06,377
You'd say anything to keep her
away from me.

961
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:08,055
To keep her for yourself.

962
01:29:08,535 --> 01:29:11,096
You said being a team
means trusting your partner.

963
01:29:11,297 --> 01:29:15,622
Sometimes, counting on someone
else is the only way to win. Remember?

964
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:19,775
You weren't talking about partners,
but about being a family.

965
01:29:20,417 --> 01:29:21,818
So I'm asking you...

966
01:29:21,981 --> 01:29:23,582
friend, partner...

967
01:29:23,822 --> 01:29:24,781
brother...

968
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:27,543
will you trust me now?

969
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:42,015
- All the crystals are in place.
- Thank you.

970
01:29:51,135 --> 01:29:52,334
Hi!

971
01:29:52,536 --> 01:29:54,300
I'm sorry about the door.

972
01:29:55,183 --> 01:29:56,381
Is the party over?

973
01:29:59,335 --> 01:30:01,177
Who is this nutball?

974
01:30:39,097 --> 01:30:40,660
If revenge...

975
01:30:40,862 --> 01:30:43,135
is a dish best served cold...

976
01:30:43,576 --> 01:30:46,021
then put on your Sunday finest.

977
01:30:46,539 --> 01:30:47,623
It's time...

978
01:30:47,939 --> 01:30:49,541
to feast!

979
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:01,702
Tonight...

980
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:04,742
hell freezes over.

981
01:31:42,538 --> 01:31:43,938
Intruder alert.

982
01:31:44,101 --> 01:31:45,223
Intruder alert.

983
01:31:47,458 --> 01:31:49,577
Intruder alert. Identify.

984
01:31:50,383 --> 01:31:52,742
Uncle Alfred, it's me. Barbara.

985
01:31:53,183 --> 01:31:55,983
I expected you might find
your way down here, child.

986
01:31:56,223 --> 01:31:58,496
I programmed my brain algorithms...

987
01:31:58,698 --> 01:32:00,136
into the Batcomputer...

988
01:32:00,299 --> 01:32:03,694
and created a virtual simulation.

989
01:32:03,982 --> 01:32:06,015
I'd like to help Batman and Robin.

990
01:32:06,178 --> 01:32:07,780
I anticipated you would...

991
01:32:07,981 --> 01:32:11,175
and took the liberty
to create something in your size.

992
01:32:12,421 --> 01:32:14,455
Suit me up, Uncle Alfred.

993
01:33:32,022 --> 01:33:33,259
Hi there.

994
01:33:37,258 --> 01:33:39,857
Is your thumb the only part
of you that's green?

995
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:43,022
You will just have to find out.

996
01:33:43,617 --> 01:33:45,420
I want us to be together, but...

997
01:33:45,583 --> 01:33:48,095
you must be serious
about turning over a new leaf.

998
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:50,694
I need a sign...

999
01:33:51,663 --> 01:33:53,696
How about slippery when wet.

1000
01:33:53,859 --> 01:33:55,020
...of trust.

1001
01:33:55,336 --> 01:33:56,861
Tell me your plan.

1002
01:33:57,062 --> 01:33:58,501
Kiss me and I'll tell you.

1003
01:33:59,422 --> 01:34:01,263
Tell me and I'll kiss you.

1004
01:34:02,663 --> 01:34:07,219
Freeze has taken the new telescope
and turned it into a giant freezing gun.

1005
01:34:07,535 --> 01:34:10,019
He's about to turn Gotham
into an ice cube.

1006
01:34:11,295 --> 01:34:12,656
I've got to stop him.

1007
01:34:12,819 --> 01:34:13,941
One kiss...

1008
01:34:14,181 --> 01:34:15,179
my love.

1009
01:34:16,301 --> 01:34:17,663
For luck.

1010
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:31,895
Bad luck, I'm afraid.

1011
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:34,618
Time to die, little Robin.

1012
01:34:37,697 --> 01:34:39,903
I hate to disappoint you, but...

1013
01:34:43,777 --> 01:34:46,376
rubber lips are immune to
your charms.

1014
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:54,538
See you!

1015
01:34:56,417 --> 01:34:59,055
You're not the only one
who can set a trap, Venus.

1016
01:34:59,458 --> 01:35:00,378
Sorry...

1017
01:35:00,580 --> 01:35:03,102
my vines have a crush on you.

1018
01:35:10,621 --> 01:35:11,820
Got to go.

1019
01:35:11,983 --> 01:35:15,301
So many people to kill,
so little time.

1020
01:35:24,421 --> 01:35:26,023
You're about to become compost.

1021
01:35:33,417 --> 01:35:35,978
Using feminine wiles
to get what you want?

1022
01:35:36,141 --> 01:35:37,138
Trading on your looks?

1023
01:35:37,301 --> 01:35:38,184
Read a book.

1024
01:35:38,337 --> 01:35:40,696
That passive-aggressive
number went out long ago.

1025
01:35:40,898 --> 01:35:42,854
You give women a bad name.

1026
01:36:02,303 --> 01:36:06,015
As I told Lady Fries,
when I pulled her plug...

1027
01:36:06,542 --> 01:36:08,182
this is a one-woman show.

1028
01:36:08,624 --> 01:36:09,899
I don't think so.

1029
01:36:30,739 --> 01:36:31,736
Curses!

1030
01:36:47,378 --> 01:36:48,942
Freeze is going to ice the city.

1031
01:36:49,143 --> 01:36:50,256
I know.

1032
01:36:50,457 --> 01:36:51,378
And you are?

1033
01:36:51,617 --> 01:36:52,615
Batgirl.

1034
01:36:52,816 --> 01:36:56,221
That's not P.C. What about
Batperson or Batwoman?

1035
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:59,740
Bruce, it's me, Barbara.
I found the Batcave.

1036
01:36:59,942 --> 01:37:01,342
We must change the locks.

1037
01:37:01,543 --> 01:37:03,615
- She knows who we are.
- We must kill her.

1038
01:37:03,778 --> 01:37:06,022
Later. We have work to do.

1039
01:37:24,455 --> 01:37:27,342
Let's kick some ice.

1040
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:53,943
We have 11 minutes
to thaw the city.

1041
01:39:20,298 --> 01:39:21,420
Gotcha!

1042
01:39:22,379 --> 01:39:23,338
Now!

1043
01:39:32,583 --> 01:39:33,858
Shield.

1044
01:39:54,976 --> 01:39:56,137
I'll finish off the city.

1045
01:39:56,300 --> 01:39:58,496
You kill the kids, but...

1046
01:39:58,659 --> 01:40:00,903
leave me the Bat.

1047
01:40:20,295 --> 01:40:21,542
No sign of the snowman.

1048
01:40:22,261 --> 01:40:23,978
Maybe he melted.

1049
01:40:24,179 --> 01:40:26,222
No, he's just hibernating.

1050
01:40:43,341 --> 01:40:44,415
These heaters will thaw them.

1051
01:40:52,135 --> 01:40:54,178
I hope you've got
10 million more of those toys.

1052
01:40:54,542 --> 01:40:56,624
8 minutes
and they're ice cubes forever.

1053
01:40:56,777 --> 01:40:58,379
Sunlight could reverse
the freezing process.

1054
01:40:58,542 --> 01:40:59,942
Sunrise isn't for 5 hours.

1055
01:41:00,095 --> 01:41:00,623
Here.

1056
01:41:00,776 --> 01:41:02,138
It's morning in the Congo.

1057
01:41:02,339 --> 01:41:03,337
We'll relay sunlight...

1058
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:04,699
From below the equator...

1059
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:07,461
It'll take the satellites
a minute to realign, but...

1060
01:41:07,979 --> 01:41:08,583
Damn!

1061
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:10,261
Damn?
Damn's not good.

1062
01:41:10,501 --> 01:41:13,023
Those targeting mirrors are frozen.
The thawing beam won't work.

1063
01:41:13,215 --> 01:41:14,701
I realign, you thaw the mirrors.

1064
01:41:39,896 --> 01:41:41,257
Tonight's forecast.

1065
01:41:41,497 --> 01:41:43,300
A freeze is coming.

1066
01:41:57,062 --> 01:41:58,463
Bye-bye.

1067
01:42:10,901 --> 01:42:12,100
I got you!

1068
01:42:22,295 --> 01:42:24,299
No. I got you.

1069
01:42:36,776 --> 01:42:38,502
It's one of those days!

1070
01:43:30,463 --> 01:43:31,979
Dirty fighter!

1071
01:43:46,700 --> 01:43:47,659
The tube!

1072
01:44:01,901 --> 01:44:02,783
Yay, Batman!

1073
01:44:15,778 --> 01:44:17,303
Hey, Freeze.

1074
01:44:17,495 --> 01:44:18,463
The heat is on.

1075
01:44:31,257 --> 01:44:33,022
You all right down there?

1076
01:44:34,537 --> 01:44:35,496
Here goes.

1077
01:45:03,337 --> 01:45:04,459
Hang on.

1078
01:45:19,698 --> 01:45:20,619
You're doing it!

1079
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:23,496
You've lost, Freeze.

1080
01:45:24,023 --> 01:45:24,982
I think not.

1081
01:45:26,296 --> 01:45:27,860
Bombs away, Batman.

1082
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:53,581
Freeze in hell, Batman!

1083
01:46:20,415 --> 01:46:21,978
What should we do now?

1084
01:46:22,180 --> 01:46:23,024
Pray.

1085
01:46:28,615 --> 01:46:30,063
Hang on!

1086
01:46:32,777 --> 01:46:34,618
Grab on to my belt!

1087
01:46:52,543 --> 01:46:54,097
Thank you, Batman!

1088
01:46:59,141 --> 01:47:00,100
Need a ride?

1089
01:47:10,822 --> 01:47:13,220
- Most of Gotham's still frozen.
- It's midnight.

1090
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:16,059
Telescope's gone.
There's no way to thaw the city.

1091
01:47:16,222 --> 01:47:19,137
The satellites could do it,
but it'd take a computer genius.

1092
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:20,259
I'm on it.

1093
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:22,139
No, I'm on it.

1094
01:47:27,864 --> 01:47:29,217
Have to do it upside down.

1095
01:47:29,418 --> 01:47:31,902
Men! Everything the hard way.

1096
01:47:34,376 --> 01:47:36,304
You're pretty good at this, little girl.

1097
01:47:37,896 --> 01:47:40,255
Watch and learn, little boy.

1098
01:48:44,501 --> 01:48:46,381
They say it'll be a beautiful day.

1099
01:48:54,379 --> 01:48:57,257
I'm taking you back
to Arkham Asylum.

1100
01:48:58,417 --> 01:48:59,817
Go on.

1101
01:49:00,661 --> 01:49:01,937
Kill me too.

1102
01:49:02,176 --> 01:49:03,701
Just as you killed my wife.

1103
01:49:03,903 --> 01:49:05,456
I didn't kill your wife.

1104
01:49:10,338 --> 01:49:14,184
As I told Lady Fries
when I pulled her plug...

1105
01:49:14,462 --> 01:49:16,744
this is a one-woman show.

1106
01:49:22,220 --> 01:49:24,656
But she's not dead.

1107
01:49:24,781 --> 01:49:26,661
We found her, restored her.

1108
01:49:27,179 --> 01:49:29,298
She's still frozen alive...

1109
01:49:29,576 --> 01:49:31,302
waiting for you to find a cure.

1110
01:49:32,463 --> 01:49:34,141
She lives?

1111
01:49:36,299 --> 01:49:39,502
But vengeance isn't power.
Anyone can take a life.

1112
01:49:40,020 --> 01:49:41,583
But to give life...

1113
01:49:42,015 --> 01:49:44,777
that's true power,
a power you once had.

1114
01:49:45,899 --> 01:49:47,702
She's alive.

1115
01:49:53,140 --> 01:49:54,703
So I'm asking you.

1116
01:49:55,662 --> 01:49:57,216
Victor Fries...

1117
01:49:58,021 --> 01:49:59,863
help me save another life.

1118
01:50:00,256 --> 01:50:03,143
Show me how to cure
MacGregor's Syndrome Stage 1.

1119
01:50:03,622 --> 01:50:07,257
And maybe you can also save the life
of the man your wife once loved.

1120
01:50:08,139 --> 01:50:10,144
He's still inside you, Victor.

1121
01:50:11,103 --> 01:50:12,138
Buried...

1122
01:50:12,417 --> 01:50:14,421
deep beneath the snow.

1123
01:50:16,943 --> 01:50:18,535
Will you help me...

1124
01:50:20,022 --> 01:50:20,616
Doctor?

1125
01:50:44,784 --> 01:50:46,702
Take 2 of these...

1126
01:50:47,939 --> 01:50:49,781
and call me in the morning.

1127
01:50:59,899 --> 01:51:02,459
I'll have your wife
moved to the lab at Arkham.

1128
01:51:02,661 --> 01:51:04,943
You'll be able to continue
your research there.

1129
01:51:27,625 --> 01:51:29,696
All we can do now is wait...

1130
01:51:30,502 --> 01:51:32,257
and hope.

1131
01:51:57,422 --> 01:51:59,177
He loves me.

1132
01:52:00,616 --> 01:52:02,380
He loves me not.

1133
01:52:04,624 --> 01:52:06,178
He loves me.

1134
01:52:07,981 --> 01:52:09,055
Not!

1135
01:52:10,858 --> 01:52:12,297
Surprise.

1136
01:52:12,498 --> 01:52:14,416
I'm your new cellmate.

1137
01:52:16,699 --> 01:52:19,777
And I've come to make your life
a living hell.

1138
01:52:20,736 --> 01:52:21,657
Prepare...

1139
01:52:21,897 --> 01:52:23,623
for a bitter harvest.

1140
01:52:27,181 --> 01:52:28,303
Winter...

1141
01:52:28,620 --> 01:52:30,538
has come at last.

1142
01:53:14,299 --> 01:53:15,104
Are you...?

1143
01:53:15,258 --> 01:53:19,861
Rather disappointed at how poorly
I have taught you proper housekeeping.

1144
01:53:20,302 --> 01:53:22,057
And quite well, it seems!

1145
01:53:22,499 --> 01:53:23,822
Thanks to you, son.

1146
01:53:23,975 --> 01:53:26,143
Thanks to you all.

1147
01:53:26,344 --> 01:53:27,860
Well done, Bruce.

1148
01:53:28,224 --> 01:53:30,219
You too. Well done.

1149
01:53:31,504 --> 01:53:32,981
I got one question.

1150
01:53:33,297 --> 01:53:36,855
When we fell off the telescope,
why didn't you try and save us?

1151
01:53:37,057 --> 01:53:39,138
It's the first time I've fallen
and you weren't there.

1152
01:53:39,780 --> 01:53:41,018
I figured you could handle it.

1153
01:53:41,181 --> 01:53:45,698
You know, sometimes counting on
somebody else is the only way to win.

1154
01:53:48,460 --> 01:53:49,256
Excuse me.

1155
01:53:49,419 --> 01:53:51,778
I'm the one who
kicked Ivy's botanical butt.

1156
01:53:51,941 --> 01:53:53,025
Yeah, that was me.

1157
01:53:53,217 --> 01:53:54,502
I did it all by myself.

1158
01:53:54,741 --> 01:53:55,662
That was me.

1159
01:53:55,902 --> 01:53:58,060
You are going back to school.

1160
01:53:58,261 --> 01:53:59,901
You'll never win this argument.

1161
01:54:04,783 --> 01:54:05,905
Partners?

1162
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:11,496
Partners.

1163
01:54:20,616 --> 01:54:22,343
Partners.

1164
01:54:25,661 --> 01:54:27,656
We're going to need a bigger cave.
