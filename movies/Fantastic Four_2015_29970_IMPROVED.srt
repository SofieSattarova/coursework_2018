1
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:38,089
Ever since I was three...

2
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:40,536
I wanted to play quarterback
for the New York Giants...

3
00:00:40,773 --> 00:00:43,040
like my personal hero, Eli
Manning.

4
00:00:43,356 --> 00:00:47,464
Annual salary is between ten and
twenty million dollars a year.

5
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:48,888
Thank you.

6
00:00:49,955 --> 00:00:52,255
Next up, Reed.

7
00:00:54,831 --> 00:00:56,231
Mr. Richards?

8
00:00:57,131 --> 00:00:59,031
Earth to Richards.

9
00:00:59,156 --> 00:01:02,102
Beam me up, Scotty.

10
00:01:02,126 --> 00:01:04,459
Okay, come on, guys.
Oh, sorry.

11
00:01:10,455 --> 00:01:11,525
When I grow up...

12
00:01:11,526 --> 00:01:13,720
I want to be the first person
in human history...

13
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,500
to teleport himself.

14
00:01:18,126 --> 00:01:19,526
I'm sorry, what?

15
00:01:21,309 --> 00:01:23,657
It's already possible to transport
quantum information...

16
00:01:23,757 --> 00:01:25,765
from one location to another.

17
00:01:25,857 --> 00:01:28,494
Right now there are supercomputers
that can transport...

18
00:01:28,594 --> 00:01:30,360
quantum information through
space...

19
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:33,481
so, why not a machine that can
send people through space?

20
00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:36,845
Well, even if you could build
the thing, which you can't...

21
00:01:36,945 --> 00:01:38,534
I've already built it.

22
00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:41,560
Well, I'm building it.
In my garage.

23
00:01:41,604 --> 00:01:44,737
Is it next to your flying car?

24
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,181
I'm not working on that, anymore.
Just this, now.

25
00:01:48,205 --> 00:01:51,226
I call it The Biomatter Shuttle.
Biomatter...

26
00:01:51,326 --> 00:01:54,112
Technically, I'm shuttling matter
from one place to another.

27
00:01:54,212 --> 00:01:55,968
Well, first, matter...

28
00:01:56,068 --> 00:01:58,022
but once I test on biological
materials, I can...

29
00:01:58,122 --> 00:02:00,026
All right, well... thank you,
Mr. Richards...

30
00:02:00,126 --> 00:02:02,876
this is all very interesting,
but the assignment...

31
00:02:02,976 --> 00:02:06,723
was to pick a real career, in
the real world.

32
00:02:06,724 --> 00:02:10,257
Redo the report and I'll let
you try again tomorrow.

33
00:02:14,888 --> 00:02:16,288
Ben?

34
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,735
Hey, where you going?
I got homework.

35
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:07,301
What?
Look at that fridge pile.

36
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,526
Idiot.
What'd you say?

37
00:03:15,714 --> 00:03:18,048
Hey! Clobberin' time.
Come here.

38
00:03:18,148 --> 00:03:19,833
What'd you think, you think
you can talk to me like that?

39
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,453
Huh, you think you can talk
to me like that?

40
00:03:21,553 --> 00:03:23,548
Punk, I ought to beat...
What the hell's the matter with you?

41
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,760
Huh? Huh?
Ma...

42
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:28,775
I didn't do nothing, ma, I
swear to God.

43
00:03:29,282 --> 00:03:30,787
Go check on that fuss.

44
00:03:30,887 --> 00:03:33,048
You didn't do nothing?
I watched you.

45
00:03:33,148 --> 00:03:33,912
What's the matter with you?

46
00:03:34,012 --> 00:03:37,296
How many times do I have to
tell you, you don't hit a kid!

47
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:46,229
Hey!

48
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:51,569
Hello?

49
00:03:54,488 --> 00:03:55,888
Who's in there?

50
00:03:58,254 --> 00:03:59,654
Please don't kill me.

51
00:04:00,452 --> 00:04:01,852
Take that off.

52
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,323
I know you... from school.

53
00:04:10,073 --> 00:04:12,666
I'm just looking for a power
converter.

54
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:13,965
I'm building something.

55
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:16,806
Ben! What's going on out there?
Hold on!

56
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:19,562
That teleporting thing?

57
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:23,176
I can show it to you, I just
need the converter.

58
00:04:25,218 --> 00:04:26,618
All right.

59
00:04:59,369 --> 00:05:02,369
Is that it?
Yeah. Help... me.

60
00:05:09,348 --> 00:05:10,748
Here you go.

61
00:05:12,224 --> 00:05:14,091
Your family owns a junkyard?

62
00:05:14,484 --> 00:05:15,584
Mm-hm.

63
00:05:15,585 --> 00:05:17,052
That place is awesome.

64
00:05:17,964 --> 00:05:20,097
Here, you're stripping the
head.

65
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:22,532
You might want to cover your
ears.

66
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:24,858
Stand back a little.

67
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:29,962
What the hell?

68
00:05:30,102 --> 00:05:31,502
Dammit.

69
00:05:33,122 --> 00:05:35,522
It's all right.
All right, come on.

70
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:38,267
Don't blow up.

71
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,840
Don't blow up.

72
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:47,876
Come on, man, guy's open!

73
00:05:49,285 --> 00:05:51,519
What?
Reed, what did you do?

74
00:06:00,824 --> 00:06:02,224
Now!

75
00:06:16,106 --> 00:06:17,306
Reed!

76
00:06:17,528 --> 00:06:18,928
Did it work?

77
00:06:27,696 --> 00:06:29,563
Where'd the rocks come from?

78
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:33,766
From the same place the car
went to.

79
00:06:35,883 --> 00:06:37,083
Where's that?

80
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,680
I don't know yet.

81
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,798
Reed.

82
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,217
What?

83
00:06:42,626 --> 00:06:44,026
You're insane.

84
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:46,072
Thanks.

85
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:55,983
Mr. Richards.

86
00:06:57,929 --> 00:07:00,196
Shall I alert the fire department?
Hmph.

87
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:02,759
What is this?

88
00:07:02,861 --> 00:07:05,327
Uh, this is a Cymatic Matter
Shuttle.

89
00:07:05,444 --> 00:07:07,215
Me and my associate Ben
have been working on it...

90
00:07:07,315 --> 00:07:08,501
every day, since fifth grade,
when we launched...

91
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:09,769
the beta version in my garage.

92
00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:12,667
And today is our first public
demonstration.

93
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:13,751
What does it do?

94
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,282
It modulates the frequency of
matter...

95
00:07:15,382 --> 00:07:17,903
from one location to another,
and back again.

96
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:23,401
It's a teleporter.
A teleporter.

97
00:07:23,596 --> 00:07:25,296
Model car, please.

98
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,838
Model... the model car, please,
Ben.

99
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:31,078
I don't have the model car.
Why don't you have the model car?

100
00:07:31,173 --> 00:07:32,761
I brought it in for this...
I specifically said...

101
00:07:32,762 --> 00:07:36,348
Mr. Richards?
Okay, I will use this model plane.

102
00:07:38,105 --> 00:07:39,735
Hey, I just need to use this
for, uh, one second...

103
00:07:39,747 --> 00:07:41,545
I'll give it back, I promise,
thanks.

104
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:45,892
Here we go.

105
00:07:46,557 --> 00:07:48,557
Ben?
Please.

106
00:07:50,643 --> 00:07:52,776
You may want to cover your ears.

107
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:09,051
Great. Now Ben, bring it on back.
Yeah.

108
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,667
Oh, keep them covered.
All right, come on...

109
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,410
What?
Do this...

110
00:08:21,604 --> 00:08:23,004
Oh!
Okay.

111
00:08:23,313 --> 00:08:25,913
Now, if I can have your attention,
please.

112
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:27,478
What you're looking at, is sand,
presumably...

113
00:08:27,578 --> 00:08:29,560
from the Gansu desert in China...

114
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:30,828
or perhaps even from the
Sahara...

115
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,461
You're disqualified.
We're not entirely sure...

116
00:08:32,561 --> 00:08:33,500
Mr. Richards.
Yeah?

117
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,681
You're disqualified.
Wait, what?

118
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:38,611
This is a science fair, not a
magic competition.

119
00:08:38,612 --> 00:08:40,477
I don't see any real science,
here.

120
00:08:40,577 --> 00:08:42,742
And you're paying for the
backboard.

121
00:08:48,922 --> 00:08:51,128
What did you put in the sensors?
Everything is the same.

122
00:08:51,228 --> 00:08:52,371
I know, but your smashing the
buttons.

123
00:08:52,471 --> 00:08:54,674
It's delicate, you can't smash it.

124
00:08:54,774 --> 00:08:57,038
Hey, kid, I'm really sorry
about your plane.

125
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,439
You're a dick.

126
00:08:59,946 --> 00:09:01,548
You cranked it up too high.
I didn't crank it up too high...

127
00:09:01,648 --> 00:09:03,154
it's on the same settings as
the first time.

128
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:04,692
It's very... I know, it's very
precise.

129
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:07,693
Excuse me, guys.
Let's pack it up. Yeah?

130
00:09:07,723 --> 00:09:10,456
Did you really build this in
your garage?

131
00:09:12,324 --> 00:09:13,724
Mm-hm.

132
00:09:14,391 --> 00:09:16,025
Now, this is elegant.

133
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,195
What are these?

134
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:27,062
Um, sonic projectors using
cymatics, to modulate the fuel.

135
00:09:28,332 --> 00:09:29,677
That's why we can't bring the
matter back...

136
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,480
from the other dimension.

137
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:33,399
Uh, what?

138
00:09:33,843 --> 00:09:36,122
We've gone so far as to send
matter to another dimension...

139
00:09:36,222 --> 00:09:38,535
but we haven't been able to
maintain the fuel long enough...

140
00:09:38,635 --> 00:09:40,486
to bring that matter back.

141
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,250
You just did.

142
00:09:49,808 --> 00:09:51,126
Oh, you're serious?

143
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:54,394
I think you've cracked
inter-dimensional travel.

144
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:56,990
Ah, I mean, we're not... we're
not sending anything...

145
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,004
to another dimension...

146
00:09:58,104 --> 00:10:00,290
we send something, we think,
to another part of the planet...

147
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,769
but, I don't know about another
dimension.

148
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,953
We found the same thing you did.

149
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:08,409
We've had it analyzed repeatedly...

150
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:10,842
but no one's ever seen anything
like it.

151
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,175
Oh, wow.

152
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,730
I'm sorry, we're from the Baxter
Foundation.

153
00:10:14,731 --> 00:10:16,331
This is my daughter, Sue.

154
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,380
Hi.
Hey.

155
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,533
We'd like to give you a full
scholarship.

156
00:10:23,315 --> 00:10:25,815
Uh, where did you say you were
from, again?

157
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:39,451
Hey. They could put the whole
neighborhood in there.

158
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,482
What's your name?
Uh, Reed.

159
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:55,006
Richards! Yes, of course, we've
been expecting you.

160
00:10:58,202 --> 00:11:00,469
They actually wear lab coats,
here.

161
00:11:09,093 --> 00:11:10,493
This is you, sir.

162
00:11:32,055 --> 00:11:33,455
Here.
What?

163
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,529
What is this?
A going away present.

164
00:11:40,786 --> 00:11:41,572
I'm not going away...

165
00:11:41,672 --> 00:11:43,607
I'm like, a forty minute train
ride from Oyster Bay.

166
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,711
Reed, look at this place.

167
00:11:46,725 --> 00:11:50,642
You belong here, I've been two
minutes and I already know that.

168
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:51,541
I'm just going to school, here...

169
00:11:51,641 --> 00:11:53,481
it's where I'm going to be
working.

170
00:11:54,725 --> 00:11:56,489
It looks like you're home, buddy.

171
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:51,495
Hey.

172
00:12:52,874 --> 00:12:54,208
This place is pretty incredible...

173
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:56,369
they have molecular chem books
from the 1950s.

174
00:12:56,469 --> 00:12:59,234
Oh, hey.
Sorry, did you say something?

175
00:12:59,235 --> 00:13:01,867
Yeah, I was just asking, uh...
what are you listening to?

176
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:03,268
Portishead.

177
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,741
Never heard of him.
Them.

178
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:09,453
I'll have to check them out.

179
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:15,294
I love this book.

180
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,772
It's about this guy, Captain
Nemo...

181
00:13:17,773 --> 00:13:20,773
he invents a submarine that goes
deeper than anything in history.

182
00:13:20,781 --> 00:13:22,381
Yeah, I know, I read it.

183
00:13:25,214 --> 00:13:28,747
So, you like music? Is that,
kinda like, your thing?

184
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:32,475
Pattern recognition.
Pattern recognition?

185
00:13:34,651 --> 00:13:36,926
Music is just a series of
altered patterns.

186
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,041
The musician creates the pattern
and makes us...

187
00:13:39,141 --> 00:13:41,169
anticipate a resolution...

188
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:43,933
and holds back, makes you wait
for it.

189
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:47,856
There's patterns in everything
and everyone.

190
00:13:47,857 --> 00:13:49,275
Hmm.
What's mine?

191
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,237
You want to be famous.

192
00:13:51,245 --> 00:13:53,325
Your parents, teachers, all
told you one thing...

193
00:13:53,425 --> 00:13:54,640
one way to be, and...

194
00:13:54,938 --> 00:13:57,052
you ignored them.
And now I'm here.

195
00:13:59,174 --> 00:14:00,574
So, you are.

196
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:06,735
Am I that predictable?

197
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:08,766
Everybody is.

198
00:14:09,084 --> 00:14:12,031
Well, you're wrong, I don't
want to be famous.

199
00:14:12,032 --> 00:14:14,765
I just want my work to make
a difference.

200
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,903
Well, here you are, Captain
Nemo. Go for it.

201
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,520
Bye.

202
00:14:25,349 --> 00:14:27,049
Let me guess, some kid from
the internet.

203
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:28,287
Science Fair.

204
00:14:28,387 --> 00:14:30,762
Franklin, this board has invested
a great deal...

205
00:14:30,862 --> 00:14:32,411
in your little orphanage.

206
00:14:32,511 --> 00:14:36,269
We need real world applications.
This has real world applications.

207
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:38,090
I truly believe that there is
an entirely...

208
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,693
An entirely new universe, just
beyond our ability to see.

209
00:14:41,793 --> 00:14:43,354
Yes, I read your paper.

210
00:14:43,454 --> 00:14:45,020
Once we get there...
If, we get there.

211
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,243
we'll be able to discover new
resources...

212
00:14:47,343 --> 00:14:50,405
energy sources, which will
revitalize our own.

213
00:14:50,505 --> 00:14:52,584
This is our chance to learn
more about our planet...

214
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,396
and maybe even, save it.

215
00:14:54,496 --> 00:14:55,633
And I'm sure you all would
agree...

216
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:58,628
that even if such a...
Wait, what is this?

217
00:14:58,728 --> 00:15:00,253
Victor Von Doom is on, here.

218
00:15:00,353 --> 00:15:01,745
He started this project...

219
00:15:01,845 --> 00:15:04,086
and devoted a decade of his
life, to it.

220
00:15:04,186 --> 00:15:07,604
He deserves to be in jail.
He deserves another chance.

221
00:15:07,704 --> 00:15:10,777
He set fire to your data
servers, before he left.

222
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:13,899
I'm going to personally
supervise him.

223
00:15:14,094 --> 00:15:15,187
I need his talent.

224
00:15:15,287 --> 00:15:18,689
I believe he and Reed can finally
get us there.

225
00:15:18,802 --> 00:15:19,894
We want to support you Franklin...

226
00:15:19,994 --> 00:15:22,241
but you put a lot of faith in
these kids.

227
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:24,243
I put all my faith, in them.

228
00:15:55,277 --> 00:15:57,077
So, someone stole my design.

229
00:15:57,236 --> 00:15:59,236
No one stole anything, Victor.

230
00:15:59,285 --> 00:16:04,318
Someone else figured out your
idea, and made it work.

231
00:16:04,682 --> 00:16:08,149
That's what happens when you
drop out of the world.

232
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:12,970
Other people finish what you
started.

233
00:16:17,655 --> 00:16:19,977
Well if you came to ask for
help, it'd be better you...

234
00:16:19,989 --> 00:16:22,146
didn't insult both of us, and
turned back around.

235
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,014
Don't you want to even look at
the designs?

236
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:28,611
I told you I'm done working
for you and your employers.

237
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,074
They're not my employers.

238
00:16:30,181 --> 00:16:33,341
You can't do a thing without
their permission...

239
00:16:33,353 --> 00:16:35,648
yes?
Wake up, you're an employee.

240
00:16:35,806 --> 00:16:38,335
They'll stay out of my way this
time, trust me.

241
00:16:38,336 --> 00:16:40,096
Oh, it's not you I don't trust.

242
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,260
Yeah.

243
00:16:43,514 --> 00:16:44,914
Well...

244
00:16:46,043 --> 00:16:49,310
I hate to interfere with all
your important work.

245
00:16:51,585 --> 00:16:54,819
Guess we'll just have to make
history without you.

246
00:16:54,851 --> 00:16:56,518
Is Sue going to be there?

247
00:17:00,758 --> 00:17:02,158
I trust her.

248
00:17:03,646 --> 00:17:05,513
Yes Victor, she'll be there.

249
00:17:12,514 --> 00:17:14,047
Clean yourself up, son.

250
00:17:31,068 --> 00:17:32,468
Holy shit.

251
00:17:47,863 --> 00:17:49,263
It's amazing.

252
00:17:50,213 --> 00:17:51,613
Oh.
Thanks.

253
00:17:51,832 --> 00:17:56,165
It's amazing you didn't black out
the entire western hemisphere.

254
00:17:56,401 --> 00:17:57,401
Hmm?

255
00:17:57,402 --> 00:17:59,046
You basically ripped a hole in
the fabric of space-time...

256
00:17:59,047 --> 00:18:01,780
with unspeced components and
no supervision.

257
00:18:01,843 --> 00:18:04,061
Yeah, that was uh, an accident.

258
00:18:04,161 --> 00:18:05,468
And if by accident you upped
the power...

259
00:18:05,568 --> 00:18:07,026
you would have created a
run-away reaction...

260
00:18:07,126 --> 00:18:10,976
that opened a black hole, and
swallowed the entire planet.

261
00:18:11,277 --> 00:18:13,398
Well, I'm glad that didn't
happen.

262
00:18:15,408 --> 00:18:17,008
Are you helping on this?

263
00:18:18,238 --> 00:18:20,438
I'm making the environment
suits.

264
00:18:21,096 --> 00:18:23,033
Based on the soil samples from
our experiments...

265
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:24,180
anyone who goes to the other
dimension...

266
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,035
is going to need to be protected.

267
00:18:29,532 --> 00:18:30,932
Who's that?

268
00:18:31,296 --> 00:18:32,496
Victor.

269
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,628
Who's Victor?

270
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,654
He started this whole project.

271
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:37,507
Oh.
Does he go here, too?

272
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,180
It's complicated.

273
00:18:43,506 --> 00:18:44,906
Rudimentary.

274
00:18:46,964 --> 00:18:48,364
Elementary.

275
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,866
It's basically a child's drawing.

276
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:54,832
You know what Albert Einstein
said.

277
00:18:54,932 --> 00:18:56,772
If you can't explain it simply...

278
00:18:56,872 --> 00:18:59,071
you don't understand it well
enough.

279
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,366
Ten years searching for something
that is...

280
00:19:01,378 --> 00:19:03,692
basically runner-up for a baking
soda volcano.

281
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,733
We were actually disqualified.
The potato clock got second.

282
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,197
Reed Richards, Victor Von Doom.

283
00:19:10,945 --> 00:19:12,876
Victor started the Quantum Gate
project...

284
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:14,764
when he was younger than you.

285
00:19:15,537 --> 00:19:17,325
Well, it's great to meet you.

286
00:19:19,675 --> 00:19:21,409
Hi, Susan.
Hey, Victor.

287
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,277
Do you prefer Susan?
No. It's been awhile.

288
00:19:25,377 --> 00:19:26,942
I didn't expect to see you
back here.

289
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:28,807
Yeah, well I couldn't resist.

290
00:19:29,107 --> 00:19:30,379
When I heard about the design...

291
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:31,960
I needed to see it with my own
eyes.

292
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,874
I gotta say it's pretty impressive...
Thank you.

293
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:36,923
that you nearly destroyed an
entire planet...

294
00:19:37,023 --> 00:19:39,483
with speaker cable and aluminum
foil.

295
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,436
Yeah, that was an accident.
He did get it to work.

296
00:19:43,472 --> 00:19:44,872
What is this?

297
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,934
This is where your little, uh,
accident leads to.

298
00:19:50,717 --> 00:19:52,917
We put a camera on a drone we
sent over there.

299
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,170
The drone didn't come back, but
those images did.

300
00:19:57,118 --> 00:19:58,942
Huh.
It's beautiful.

301
00:19:59,343 --> 00:20:03,277
Yes it is. New energy, resources.
It's a whole new world.

302
00:20:03,554 --> 00:20:05,488
Which can help save this one.

303
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,893
Not that it deserves to be
saved.

304
00:20:08,993 --> 00:20:10,918
I mean think about, the people
running the Earth...

305
00:20:11,018 --> 00:20:12,290
are the same ones running it into
the ground...

306
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,466
so, maybe it deserves what it's
got coming to it.

307
00:20:14,566 --> 00:20:16,241
Dr. Doom, over here.

308
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:21,283
The failures of my generation
are the opportunities for yours.

309
00:20:21,862 --> 00:20:25,318
There are no greater minds,
than the ones in this room.

310
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:27,959
Is he gonna give a speech?
He's gonna give a speech.

311
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,352
But you're going to have to
all come together.

312
00:20:30,353 --> 00:20:32,919
Each of you working together
with a level of commitment...

313
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,243
and collaboration, putting aside
petty squabbles...

314
00:20:36,244 --> 00:20:39,139
if you want to fix what my
generation broke.

315
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,326
If you can do that, work
together...

316
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:45,194
then you can change the course
of history.

317
00:20:46,634 --> 00:20:48,501
That's a pretty good speech.

318
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,774
I'm in.

319
00:20:51,932 --> 00:20:53,599
Me too.
I'm here, right?

320
00:20:54,154 --> 00:20:58,184
First, design. We figure out
what went wrong and correct it.

321
00:20:58,185 --> 00:21:01,714
Then we build, then we send
organic matter over there.

322
00:21:01,715 --> 00:21:03,791
But more importantly, we bring
it back.

323
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:07,829
And then, most importantly,
they send us.

324
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,358
Us?

325
00:21:11,832 --> 00:21:13,232
"Us", us?

326
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:15,748
We're going over there?

327
00:21:15,749 --> 00:21:17,540
Not unless you get to work.

328
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,550
So, get to work.

329
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,383
Johnny Storm.

330
00:21:37,483 --> 00:21:40,604
So, that's the piece of shit
Toyota you been talking about.

331
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,295
Well, yes it is.

332
00:21:42,296 --> 00:21:46,429
Now, you promise me, we'll still
be cool after I dust your ass.

333
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:02,715
No.

334
00:22:02,716 --> 00:22:04,116
Come on.

335
00:22:23,462 --> 00:22:24,862
Rookie!

336
00:22:37,663 --> 00:22:39,063
Bye bye.

337
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,110
Ha ha ha ha!

338
00:22:47,747 --> 00:22:49,147
Aw, sh...

339
00:22:56,936 --> 00:23:00,603
I cannot believe you are out
here doing this nonsense again.

340
00:23:00,604 --> 00:23:02,004
I told you.

341
00:23:03,096 --> 00:23:03,627
What?

342
00:23:03,727 --> 00:23:06,493
I told you, I was doing 45 when
I spun out.

343
00:23:07,141 --> 00:23:08,060
Yeah...

344
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,820
The ground was wet and I
hydroplaned.

345
00:23:11,131 --> 00:23:14,264
Funny, I don't seem to remember
any rain, today.

346
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:17,025
You were probably too busy to
notice.

347
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:25,036
Johnny!

348
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:27,187
I thought you were turning
things around, what is this?

349
00:23:27,287 --> 00:23:29,732
What are you talking about?
This, this!

350
00:23:29,832 --> 00:23:32,522
Is this the way you want the
rest of your life to be?

351
00:23:32,722 --> 00:23:33,979
You keep acting out!

352
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,782
You have the potential and the
IQ to do so much more.

353
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,603
Oh, you mean like Sue?

354
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:40,529
I know you think you know what's
best for you...

355
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:42,015
but trust me son, you do not.

356
00:23:42,115 --> 00:23:44,218
Can you stop that?
What? Stop what?

357
00:23:44,318 --> 00:23:46,719
Stop talking to me like I'm
one of your students.

358
00:23:48,696 --> 00:23:50,034
Well, you're not getting the
car back.

359
00:23:50,134 --> 00:23:51,217
Excuse me?

360
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:53,019
You're not getting the car
back.

361
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:55,704
I built that thing from scratch,
with my own two hands.

362
00:23:55,705 --> 00:23:57,105
With my money.

363
00:23:58,882 --> 00:24:00,282
My money, my car.

364
00:24:01,653 --> 00:24:04,787
You want it back, you're gonna
have to earn it.

365
00:24:05,024 --> 00:24:07,473
You're gonna have to come work
for me.

366
00:24:07,474 --> 00:24:09,189
I'm not wearing a lab coat.

367
00:24:16,675 --> 00:24:18,608
I appreciate your work, miss.

368
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:22,497
Aw, you gotta untuck that shirt,
man.

369
00:24:23,434 --> 00:24:24,834
Is that... Adolph?

370
00:24:25,687 --> 00:24:27,087
Long time.

371
00:24:27,104 --> 00:24:30,287
I'm still not German. And, we
don't need any more help.

372
00:24:30,288 --> 00:24:31,059
Yes, you do.

373
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:33,091
With what, his boundless
enthusiasm?

374
00:24:33,191 --> 00:24:35,576
Oh, why, thank you, Victor.
He can build anything.

375
00:24:35,606 --> 00:24:37,688
With a broken arm.
What exactly happened?

376
00:24:37,788 --> 00:24:39,557
What?
Were you racing, again?

377
00:24:39,657 --> 00:24:41,025
I don't know what you're talking
about.

378
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:43,390
I could use some help, actually.

379
00:24:43,677 --> 00:24:45,522
Oh, this guy doesn't take orders
well.

380
00:24:45,622 --> 00:24:47,574
Yeah, especially from people
who say shit like...

381
00:24:47,674 --> 00:24:49,971
"I don't take orders well."

382
00:24:51,459 --> 00:24:54,075
What you need, buddy?
Oh, that's brilliant.

383
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,165
What's up?
Hey.

384
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:56,904
Johnny.
Reed... nice to meet you.

385
00:24:57,109 --> 00:24:58,809
Have you welded before?
Of course.

386
00:26:09,629 --> 00:26:11,029
Hey.

387
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:13,211
What's up?

388
00:26:14,958 --> 00:26:17,492
I gotta say, it's fun having
you here.

389
00:26:17,721 --> 00:26:19,121
Mm-hm.

390
00:26:19,591 --> 00:26:22,388
You kinda look like you're in
your element.

391
00:26:22,389 --> 00:26:24,122
Look, don't get used to this.

392
00:26:24,123 --> 00:26:26,192
I'm just here to get my car
back.

393
00:26:29,412 --> 00:26:30,812
Right.

394
00:26:31,908 --> 00:26:33,575
It's good seeing you, too.

395
00:27:24,585 --> 00:27:25,985
Sorry.

396
00:27:26,267 --> 00:27:27,667
Oh, my God.

397
00:27:28,133 --> 00:27:30,015
Why did you do that?
Sorry.

398
00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:32,173
I freak out like that, I was
like... sorry.

399
00:27:32,174 --> 00:27:33,645
You were sort of, sleeping.

400
00:27:33,646 --> 00:27:35,638
Was I?
Is that what that was?

401
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:38,067
It's okay if you need to take
a nap, or something.

402
00:27:38,068 --> 00:27:39,468
No, I'm good, thanks.

403
00:27:40,286 --> 00:27:41,811
Uh, so, that must have been...

404
00:27:42,975 --> 00:27:45,344
cool, with, uh, Dr. Storm as
your dad.

405
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:46,272
Yeah.

406
00:27:46,273 --> 00:27:47,673
Did he adopt you?

407
00:27:47,796 --> 00:27:49,196
Mm-hm.

408
00:27:50,354 --> 00:27:51,847
Yeah, I know what that's like.

409
00:27:51,947 --> 00:27:52,986
You were adopted?

410
00:27:53,086 --> 00:27:55,497
No, I... I just wish that I was.

411
00:27:56,004 --> 00:27:57,004
Why?

412
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:01,076
I don't know, I just, we don't
really understand each other.

413
00:28:01,077 --> 00:28:03,367
Where were you born?
Kosovo.

414
00:28:03,467 --> 00:28:04,964
Kosovo...

415
00:28:05,578 --> 00:28:07,245
You don't have an accent.

416
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:10,513
I don't?

417
00:28:36,502 --> 00:28:38,369
Hey Reed, can I have a word?

418
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:40,183
Okay, yeah.

419
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,704
Hey.

420
00:28:52,641 --> 00:28:54,442
You're being unprofessional.

421
00:28:54,443 --> 00:28:57,043
You're supposed to be down
here, working.

422
00:28:57,857 --> 00:29:00,724
Yeah, I am.
That's what we've been doing.

423
00:29:00,887 --> 00:29:02,887
That's not what it looks like.

424
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,310
We're finished.

425
00:29:04,927 --> 00:29:06,076
What?

426
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:09,144
Yeah, we, we finished it.
Do you want to see?

427
00:29:09,941 --> 00:29:11,341
Yeah.

428
00:29:12,326 --> 00:29:13,726
Hey, Sue.

429
00:29:14,063 --> 00:29:15,463
Can you show him?

430
00:29:20,543 --> 00:29:22,125
I'm really tired, I'm going to
go take a nap.

431
00:29:22,225 --> 00:29:24,560
Can you tell Dr. Storm for me?

432
00:29:24,695 --> 00:29:25,755
We did it, Victor.

433
00:29:59,241 --> 00:30:00,708
Harvey.
Franklin.

434
00:30:01,077 --> 00:30:04,877
Big day. Didn't think we'd make
it here, but, well done.

435
00:30:05,632 --> 00:30:07,898
I told you these kids could
do it.

436
00:30:08,216 --> 00:30:09,616
Harvey's here.

437
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:20,793
Organic test commencing.

438
00:30:23,779 --> 00:30:25,179
Clear for launch.

439
00:30:25,738 --> 00:30:27,138
Goggles up.

440
00:30:29,811 --> 00:30:31,211
Ten...

441
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,820
nine...

442
00:30:33,328 --> 00:30:34,728
eight...

443
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:36,902
seven...

444
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:38,769
six...

445
00:30:39,155 --> 00:30:40,555
five...

446
00:30:41,282 --> 00:30:42,682
four...

447
00:30:43,394 --> 00:30:44,794
three...

448
00:30:45,723 --> 00:30:47,123
two...

449
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:49,145
one.

450
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:13,168
Standing by for video on
position.

451
00:31:16,739 --> 00:31:18,406
Status unknown, stand by.

452
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,800
Trying an alternate frequency.

453
00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:25,309
We've got signal.

454
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:34,576
Look at the plates, it's almost
primordial.

455
00:31:34,577 --> 00:31:37,462
Unformed, like Earth over a
billion years ago.

456
00:31:38,261 --> 00:31:41,727
That place could explain the
origin of our species...

457
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:44,265
the evolution of our planet...

458
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:48,834
answers to questions we don't
even know to ask, yet.

459
00:31:54,832 --> 00:31:58,299
EPS, body temp, ventilation
rates are all elevated.

460
00:32:00,129 --> 00:32:01,529
Let's bring him back.

461
00:32:07,683 --> 00:32:09,083
Goggles up.

462
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:13,582
In five...

463
00:32:14,118 --> 00:32:15,518
four...

464
00:32:15,698 --> 00:32:17,098
three...

465
00:32:17,294 --> 00:32:18,694
two...

466
00:32:18,918 --> 00:32:20,318
one.

467
00:32:35,814 --> 00:32:37,214
How is he?

468
00:32:37,577 --> 00:32:38,977
The vitals are good.

469
00:32:39,934 --> 00:32:41,334
They're really good.

470
00:32:41,865 --> 00:32:43,265
He made it.

471
00:32:43,709 --> 00:32:45,109
It's safe.

472
00:32:51,175 --> 00:32:52,175
All right.

473
00:32:52,176 --> 00:32:53,576
Looks like we're next.

474
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,240
Gentlemen.

475
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:05,749
Everyone.

476
00:33:05,967 --> 00:33:08,901
You all deserve an enormous
pat on the back.

477
00:33:09,347 --> 00:33:10,891
I think it's time to start
coordinating...

478
00:33:10,991 --> 00:33:13,071
with our friends at NASA.

479
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:17,839
What?

480
00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:20,997
It works. We have to start
thinking about sending men.

481
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:22,398
Yeah.

482
00:33:22,523 --> 00:33:23,533
Us.

483
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:27,800
Look, I won't deny that what
you've created here is incredible.

484
00:33:27,802 --> 00:33:30,747
But this isn't the school
Science Fair, anymore.

485
00:33:30,748 --> 00:33:32,243
We have to bring in help, now.

486
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:35,514
Well, hey, why just NASA?
Why not the Army, or the CIA?

487
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:37,406
We could send our political
prisoners there...

488
00:33:37,407 --> 00:33:40,791
waterboarding in the 4th dimension
could prove very effective.

489
00:33:40,792 --> 00:33:44,419
Why don't we discuss the details
of this, someplace else?

490
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,117
In the meantime, we appreciate
your service.

491
00:33:47,118 --> 00:33:48,518
Oh, hey, thank you.

492
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,197
I won't let this go, I promise
you.

493
00:33:59,025 --> 00:34:01,825
Just give him a second to figure
this out.

494
00:34:09,304 --> 00:34:11,774
Look, I don't know about you
guys, but, uh...

495
00:34:11,775 --> 00:34:13,376
I could use some...

496
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,610
One drink?

497
00:34:17,266 --> 00:34:18,999
Ethanol kills brain cells.

498
00:34:21,968 --> 00:34:24,168
You are a light-weight.

499
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:29,646
Looks like we need another
refill.

500
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:35,025
Yep.

501
00:34:35,308 --> 00:34:36,708
Yep.

502
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:38,238
Hey, Vic.

503
00:34:41,533 --> 00:34:43,769
You guys know who built the
Apollo spacecraft...

504
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:45,742
went to the moon?

505
00:34:46,303 --> 00:34:48,136
Yeah.
Yo' momma.

506
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,079
So, the answer's no?

507
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:55,208
But you know who Neil Armstrong
is, right?

508
00:34:55,209 --> 00:34:56,816
Oh, yeah, of course.
Of course.

509
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,455
Buzz Aldrin.
Yeah.

510
00:34:58,456 --> 00:35:00,129
First men to walk on the moon.

511
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:04,152
Famous faces hired to conquer
dreams that weren't even theirs.

512
00:35:05,817 --> 00:35:08,750
Dreams of someone else, some
other scientist...

513
00:35:08,751 --> 00:35:11,246
who probably died penniless
and alone...

514
00:35:11,247 --> 00:35:16,413
and sat in a bar telling people
he sent men to the moon.

515
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,240
That's gonna be me.

516
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,500
That's gonna be me.

517
00:35:24,387 --> 00:35:26,053
I think it's all of us.

518
00:35:29,403 --> 00:35:30,803
Unless we go first.

519
00:35:32,475 --> 00:35:35,441
Why don't we go first?
God, this thing works, okay?

520
00:35:36,607 --> 00:35:38,940
We can go up there, take five
minutes...

521
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,724
we could take a flag, plant it
down...

522
00:35:40,824 --> 00:35:41,826
get our footprints down there...

523
00:35:41,926 --> 00:35:43,161
we're going to be the first
people over there, okay?

524
00:35:43,261 --> 00:35:44,883
Screw those guys.

525
00:35:44,983 --> 00:35:47,785
My dad might actually kill me,
this time.

526
00:35:48,116 --> 00:35:52,316
Johnny, by the time your dad
finds out, we'll already be back.

527
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,176
Think about it.

528
00:35:55,136 --> 00:35:56,536
Just the three of us?

529
00:36:09,652 --> 00:36:12,252
Hello?
I'm not going without you.

530
00:36:12,332 --> 00:36:13,645
What time is it?

531
00:36:13,646 --> 00:36:16,884
Look, we started this thing
together, we're going together...

532
00:36:16,885 --> 00:36:18,654
I'm not taking no for an answer,
okay?

533
00:36:18,655 --> 00:36:20,210
Forget Neil Armstrong!
Come on.

534
00:36:20,267 --> 00:36:22,267
Neil Armstrong?

535
00:36:22,295 --> 00:36:23,495
You're drunk.

536
00:36:23,532 --> 00:36:25,287
Yeah, I am a little drunk.
Doesn't matter.

537
00:36:25,387 --> 00:36:26,694
Look, the machine works.

538
00:36:26,794 --> 00:36:29,856
The machine works, Ben, and
I need you to come with me.

539
00:36:31,401 --> 00:36:32,543
Now?

540
00:36:32,544 --> 00:36:33,593
Yeah.

541
00:36:33,594 --> 00:36:36,043
Look, Ben, I need you to come,
'cause we're going tonight.

542
00:36:36,143 --> 00:36:38,117
I told the guys that I'm not
going without you.

543
00:36:39,286 --> 00:36:41,155
Okay?
Who's going to have my back?

544
00:36:41,946 --> 00:36:45,852
All right, fine, just w... just
give me a second, all right?

545
00:36:45,853 --> 00:36:47,471
Okay.
Please, all right?

546
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:50,051
All right, bye.
Thank you, thank you.

547
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,220
He's with me.

548
00:36:58,435 --> 00:36:59,555
Hey, what's up, man?

549
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,590
What's up, buddy?
How you doing. Oh, it's you.

550
00:37:01,872 --> 00:37:02,900
Thanks, Pano.

551
00:37:02,901 --> 00:37:04,568
No problem, Mr. Richards.

552
00:37:04,749 --> 00:37:06,611
Why are we doing this tonight?
Huh?

553
00:37:06,612 --> 00:37:08,369
Why are we doing this tonight?

554
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:09,770
You trust me, right?

555
00:37:16,714 --> 00:37:18,114
Ta-da!

556
00:37:18,997 --> 00:37:21,397
It's just like ours.
But expensive.

557
00:37:24,238 --> 00:37:25,338
Guys.

558
00:37:25,429 --> 00:37:26,629
This is Ben.

559
00:37:26,722 --> 00:37:28,122
How you doing.

560
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:30,515
What's up.
Are you his lucky charm?

561
00:37:30,516 --> 00:37:33,224
I'm sorry, this is Borat.
Borat's a dick.

562
00:37:33,512 --> 00:37:35,912
You guys sure you're in the
best shape to be doing this?

563
00:37:35,913 --> 00:37:37,313
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

564
00:37:39,044 --> 00:37:40,444
We're good.

565
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:50,701
Let's do this.

566
00:37:57,186 --> 00:38:00,471
So, I guess I should come up
with something better than...

567
00:38:00,472 --> 00:38:01,872
"One small step for man?"

568
00:38:02,028 --> 00:38:05,808
Strap in and get comfy kids.
We're about to make history.

569
00:38:05,809 --> 00:38:07,387
Yeah, or die.
Either or.

570
00:38:07,996 --> 00:38:10,196
Wow. That's great, Ben.
Thanks.

571
00:38:10,935 --> 00:38:12,027
All right, gentlemen.

572
00:38:12,127 --> 00:38:16,076
Hands and feet must remain inside
the ride, at all times.

573
00:38:27,586 --> 00:38:28,986
Shit.

574
00:38:36,555 --> 00:38:38,688
Dad, you need to come to the
lab.

575
00:38:39,285 --> 00:38:40,885
Remote launch, initiated.

576
00:38:43,482 --> 00:38:44,499
Ten...

577
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,898
Don't blow up.
nine...

578
00:38:45,899 --> 00:38:47,313
Please don't blow up.

579
00:38:47,413 --> 00:38:48,561
Oh yeah, that's what I want
to hear...

580
00:38:48,661 --> 00:38:50,419
before going into another
dimension.

581
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:53,335
Yeah, don't worry, he does that.

582
00:38:53,984 --> 00:38:55,384
five...

583
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,170
four...

584
00:38:57,552 --> 00:38:58,952
three...

585
00:38:59,685 --> 00:39:01,085
two...

586
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,800
one.

587
00:39:02,964 --> 00:39:04,364
Initiate launch.

588
00:39:11,275 --> 00:39:12,675
What happened?

589
00:39:12,759 --> 00:39:14,159
Did we abort?

590
00:39:15,972 --> 00:39:18,638
Uh, I don't think that we went
anywhere.

591
00:39:23,892 --> 00:39:25,292
Goddammit.

592
00:39:28,057 --> 00:39:29,257
Johnny?

593
00:39:29,346 --> 00:39:30,746
Guys, can you hear me?

594
00:40:08,249 --> 00:40:09,649
I made it.

595
00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:13,249
Wow.

596
00:40:27,744 --> 00:40:29,144
Ben.

597
00:40:29,315 --> 00:40:30,715
Look at this place.

598
00:40:33,945 --> 00:40:35,345
It's amazing.

599
00:40:37,106 --> 00:40:38,506
We did it.

600
00:40:39,108 --> 00:40:40,508
I think we did.

601
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:52,180
Oh yeah, this one is definitely
going on Instagram.

602
00:40:52,181 --> 00:40:54,748
All right, let's do this.
Ready? After three.

603
00:40:54,815 --> 00:40:56,215
One, two, three!

604
00:40:58,117 --> 00:41:00,317
Woo! Look at that.
Whoa.

605
00:41:00,857 --> 00:41:03,269
Hey Victor, I think you should
see this.

606
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,940
The energy seems to be converging
over there.

607
00:41:10,163 --> 00:41:12,030
Come on, let's check it out.

608
00:41:13,698 --> 00:41:14,900
All right, well, let's do it
quickly...

609
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,779
so we can get out of here.

610
00:41:33,384 --> 00:41:35,617
Hmph. Nope.
Uh-uh.

611
00:41:35,899 --> 00:41:37,299
I'm good.

612
00:41:42,373 --> 00:41:43,773
Reed?

613
00:41:44,197 --> 00:41:45,262
What's he doing?

614
00:41:45,263 --> 00:41:48,481
We need to climb down there,
so we can get a better look.

615
00:41:48,482 --> 00:41:49,738
Oh, you guys go on without me.

616
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:51,574
Stay here.
We need an anchor.

617
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:56,036
Huh. Yeah, yeah yeah, I'll be
a great anchor.

618
00:42:10,353 --> 00:42:11,753
Easy does it.

619
00:42:21,134 --> 00:42:22,601
Just a little further.

620
00:42:26,954 --> 00:42:28,354
Right behind you.

621
00:42:32,209 --> 00:42:33,609
Okay.

622
00:42:55,563 --> 00:42:57,914
It's responding to physical
stimulus...

623
00:42:58,263 --> 00:43:00,293
almost like a nerve impulse.

624
00:43:00,407 --> 00:43:02,107
I can feel it...

625
00:43:03,139 --> 00:43:05,672
the energy, it's alive.

626
00:43:08,984 --> 00:43:10,384
It's incredible.

627
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,054
There's no expenditure.

628
00:43:13,208 --> 00:43:14,775
Reed!
What?

629
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,763
I think we should go back.

630
00:43:17,091 --> 00:43:18,566
This is important, Ben.

631
00:43:18,567 --> 00:43:19,967
Come take a look.

632
00:43:33,292 --> 00:43:34,692
Let's go!

633
00:43:38,144 --> 00:43:39,544
Come on!

634
00:43:42,699 --> 00:43:45,532
Come on, come on, come on!
Hurry up!

635
00:43:49,413 --> 00:43:50,813
Come on Reed, come on!

636
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:00,499
Victor!

637
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:03,719
Reed!
Hold on!

638
00:44:03,788 --> 00:44:04,988
Reed, pull me up!

639
00:44:04,995 --> 00:44:06,295
Victor!

640
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:07,777
Grab my hand!

641
00:44:08,261 --> 00:44:09,661
Reed!
Pull me up!

642
00:44:10,392 --> 00:44:12,520
Come on... come on!

643
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,954
Victor, hold on!

644
00:44:15,977 --> 00:44:18,677
Reed! I can't hold it!
Don't let go!

645
00:44:19,609 --> 00:44:21,709
Help me!

646
00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:23,233
No, Victor!

647
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:27,670
Victor!
No!

648
00:44:30,261 --> 00:44:31,758
Reed!
Let's go, come on!

649
00:44:31,759 --> 00:44:33,159
Victor!
Come on!

650
00:44:34,124 --> 00:44:35,524
We can't leave him.

651
00:44:35,861 --> 00:44:37,994
Reed, we gotta go now, come on!

652
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,967
All right, come on!
Come on!

653
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,303
Come on!
Hurry up!

654
00:44:46,242 --> 00:44:47,642
Go, go, go!

655
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:50,005
Move your ass, Reed!
Move it!

656
00:44:50,006 --> 00:44:51,406
Keep moving!

657
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,234
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

658
00:44:58,137 --> 00:44:59,870
Reed, let's go!
Okay!

659
00:45:01,604 --> 00:45:02,497
Reed, come on.

660
00:45:02,509 --> 00:45:05,224
The re-entry's not working,
I don't know what to do!

661
00:45:05,225 --> 00:45:06,625
Get us out of here!

662
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:10,581
Reed, do something, we gotta go!

663
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,605
Guys, can you hear me?
Sue!

664
00:45:12,606 --> 00:45:14,043
Sue, Sue, can you hear me?

665
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,304
Johnny!

666
00:45:15,318 --> 00:45:16,927
Do you have any idea how much
trouble you're in?

667
00:45:16,928 --> 00:45:18,869
Yes, yes, I do, Sue, listen...

668
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:21,110
I need you to manually override
the re-entry, okay?

669
00:45:21,314 --> 00:45:22,714
Okay, okay, I got it.

670
00:45:22,774 --> 00:45:25,731
Manually override the re-entry!
I'm trying!

671
00:45:26,242 --> 00:45:27,642
Sue, just do it!

672
00:45:28,649 --> 00:45:31,315
Reed, the door!
I can't close the door!

673
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:32,990
Ben!
The door won't close!

674
00:46:20,887 --> 00:46:22,287
Ben?

675
00:46:22,602 --> 00:46:24,002
Ben!

676
00:46:34,869 --> 00:46:37,369
Johnny?

677
00:46:48,989 --> 00:46:50,989
Reed!
Ben!

678
00:46:52,694 --> 00:46:54,195
Come...
Ben?

679
00:46:54,196 --> 00:46:55,863
come help me!
I'm coming!

680
00:46:58,252 --> 00:46:59,652
Reed, help me.

681
00:47:01,578 --> 00:47:02,978
Can't move.

682
00:47:04,149 --> 00:47:06,149
Ben, where are you?

683
00:47:07,725 --> 00:47:09,125
Reed.

684
00:47:13,612 --> 00:47:15,012
Ben.

685
00:47:16,739 --> 00:47:18,673
Reed, help me.
I can't move.

686
00:47:19,022 --> 00:47:20,756
I'll get you out of there.

687
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:26,583
Oh, my God.

688
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:12,920
Reed.

689
00:48:12,921 --> 00:48:14,379
Can you move your hand?

690
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,780
Where's Ben?

691
00:48:17,556 --> 00:48:18,956
Keep trying, Reed.

692
00:48:21,487 --> 00:48:23,907
Hey, do you guys know where
my friends are?

693
00:48:23,908 --> 00:48:26,391
Can you lift your index finger?
I, I...

694
00:48:26,617 --> 00:48:28,017
I'm trying...

695
00:48:28,984 --> 00:48:32,984
Where's Ben? Did you see him?
He was covered in the rocks.

696
00:48:33,348 --> 00:48:34,948
Why won't you answer me?

697
00:48:36,264 --> 00:48:37,664
Where are my friends?

698
00:48:38,914 --> 00:48:40,314
Help me!

699
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,107
Increase sedative, 50 CCs.

700
00:48:42,568 --> 00:48:44,568
What have you guys done to me?

701
00:48:57,112 --> 00:48:58,646
So, just for the record...

702
00:48:59,194 --> 00:49:02,647
this program was under your
supervision, was it not?

703
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:06,833
I already told you it was, but
I wasn't there when it happened.

704
00:49:09,501 --> 00:49:12,501
All I want to know, is where
are my children.

705
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:16,460
I need to know if they're
alive.

706
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:22,192
She's unconscious.

707
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:26,808
Somehow she's shifting in and
out of the visible spectrum.

708
00:49:27,026 --> 00:49:28,426
We don't know how.

709
00:49:33,493 --> 00:49:34,960
Her vitals are stable.

710
00:49:37,469 --> 00:49:40,269
She doesn't seem to be able to
control it.

711
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:08,078
Looks like we have some activity.

712
00:50:28,709 --> 00:50:30,709
Son!
My God...

713
00:51:05,454 --> 00:51:07,387
Help me, Reed.

714
00:51:08,735 --> 00:51:10,435
Please help me.

715
00:51:12,674 --> 00:51:14,074
Come on, Reed.

716
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:16,973
Is anybody there?

717
00:51:18,616 --> 00:51:20,016
Ben?

718
00:51:24,836 --> 00:51:26,403
Somebody?

719
00:51:43,404 --> 00:51:44,804
Help, Reed.

720
00:51:45,325 --> 00:51:46,725
Help me!

721
00:51:48,124 --> 00:51:50,191
Can anybody hear me?

722
00:51:51,556 --> 00:51:53,556
Please, help me.

723
00:52:00,499 --> 00:52:01,899
Help.

724
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:04,786
Somebody, answer me!

725
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:10,370
Anybody.

726
00:52:14,421 --> 00:52:15,821
Ben?

727
00:52:16,246 --> 00:52:17,646
Ben!

728
00:52:21,451 --> 00:52:22,559
Reed?

729
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:23,960
Oh, my God.

730
00:52:25,326 --> 00:52:28,326
Ben.
Reed, what, what happened to me?

731
00:52:29,117 --> 00:52:32,317
I don't know, but I'm going to
figure this out.

732
00:52:33,279 --> 00:52:34,679
Ben!

733
00:52:35,988 --> 00:52:38,021
Please help me, Reed!

734
00:52:38,654 --> 00:52:41,717
Subject 1 has escaped containment.

735
00:52:41,718 --> 00:52:43,218
Oh, shit.
Shit.

736
00:52:43,532 --> 00:52:46,372
Ben. Ben, I'm coming back for
you, I promise.

737
00:52:46,373 --> 00:52:48,010
No, no no no, Reed, Reed,
help me!

738
00:52:48,743 --> 00:52:50,844
Please, don't leave me!
I'm Sorry.

739
00:52:50,845 --> 00:52:52,245
Reed, do something, please!

740
00:53:13,938 --> 00:53:15,805
Where is he?
Where is Reed?

741
00:53:17,002 --> 00:53:18,402
I don't know.

742
00:53:19,351 --> 00:53:23,173
He's scared, Harvey.
They're all just scared kids.

743
00:53:23,174 --> 00:53:25,872
We don't know what they are,
right now. All we know...

744
00:53:25,884 --> 00:53:28,213
is that they are dangerous
and powerful...

745
00:53:28,313 --> 00:53:30,040
which makes them extremely
valuable...

746
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,352
to the guys who run this
place.

747
00:53:31,452 --> 00:53:33,533
If you think for a minute that
I'm going to allow you...

748
00:53:33,633 --> 00:53:34,955
to turn these kids into some
kind of...

749
00:53:35,055 --> 00:53:37,788
You don't have a choice Franklin,
and neither do I.

750
00:53:37,888 --> 00:53:39,666
Either we play ball with the
government...

751
00:53:39,766 --> 00:53:43,076
or who knows what happens to
those kids.

752
00:53:43,316 --> 00:53:44,716
Now...

753
00:53:45,695 --> 00:53:47,562
here's how this is gonna go.

754
00:53:56,606 --> 00:53:58,006
So, you're Ben Grimm.

755
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,000
Where's Reed?

756
00:54:02,845 --> 00:54:06,378
I can't begin to imagine what
you are going through.

757
00:54:09,637 --> 00:54:11,037
He said he'll fix it.

758
00:54:11,221 --> 00:54:13,921
Where is Reed?

759
00:54:14,414 --> 00:54:17,547
Reed's gone, and your friend
isn't coming back.

760
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,794
Look, I know you're scared.

761
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:25,352
You should be.

762
00:54:25,942 --> 00:54:28,665
But we can help you.
You want to find a cure?

763
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:32,066
We have resources here, the
best in the world.

764
00:54:32,461 --> 00:54:34,928
We're analyzing what happened
to you.

765
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:38,417
Whatever it is, we can find
a way to reverse it.

766
00:54:39,217 --> 00:54:40,617
We can help you, Ben.

767
00:54:42,305 --> 00:54:44,938
But you need to help us, too.

768
00:55:05,588 --> 00:55:07,321
What do you want me to do?

769
00:55:10,661 --> 00:55:14,928
His combat effectiveness this
past year has been unprecedented.

770
00:55:15,878 --> 00:55:18,026
In terms of potential, you
already know...

771
00:55:18,126 --> 00:55:20,278
what he's accomplished in the
field.

772
00:55:20,409 --> 00:55:22,845
He's been active in covert
operations...

773
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:25,285
with a 100% success rate.

774
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:27,775
Protecting our men and women
in battle...

775
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:30,393
and saving countless lives.

776
00:55:30,479 --> 00:55:35,013
Ladies and gentlemen, this is
only the beginning.

777
00:55:35,964 --> 00:55:38,918
The other survivors of the Baxter
incident...

778
00:55:39,018 --> 00:55:42,022
all exhibited unique physical
conditions.

779
00:55:42,322 --> 00:55:44,406
We developed suits which allow
them...

780
00:55:44,506 --> 00:55:46,983
to contain and control these
conditions.

781
00:55:50,357 --> 00:55:51,569
This subject's suit...

782
00:55:51,669 --> 00:55:55,014
controls her spectral flares
and refractive visibility.

783
00:55:55,149 --> 00:55:57,479
With intense concentration,
she's also developed...

784
00:55:57,579 --> 00:56:00,499
the ability to render other
objects invisible...

785
00:56:00,745 --> 00:56:03,712
and to neuropathically produce
forcefields.

786
00:56:05,191 --> 00:56:07,858
All these abilities come from
one place.

787
00:56:08,454 --> 00:56:11,059
Another dimension that our
scientists...

788
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:14,240
have taken to calling "Planet
Zero."

789
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:16,734
A planet infused with the same
energy...

790
00:56:16,834 --> 00:56:18,679
that transformed these
survivors...

791
00:56:18,814 --> 00:56:22,267
and potentially could transform
our military capabilities.

792
00:56:23,401 --> 00:56:26,201
We have the direct link.

793
00:56:27,808 --> 00:56:29,844
With your continued support...

794
00:56:29,944 --> 00:56:32,536
once the Quantum Gate 2 project
is finished...

795
00:56:32,566 --> 00:56:35,295
we'll have control over more
than that world.

796
00:56:35,701 --> 00:56:38,934
We'll have control over ours.

797
00:56:41,227 --> 00:56:43,894
Everyone, have a look.

798
00:56:47,565 --> 00:56:49,032
What the hell is that?

799
00:56:59,002 --> 00:57:00,402
Subject number 2.

800
00:57:24,929 --> 00:57:28,062
Two thousand meters in six
seconds. New record.

801
00:57:28,138 --> 00:57:30,959
I still work on my take-off.
I can make it in five.

802
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,712
All target drones, neutralized.

803
00:57:34,304 --> 00:57:37,652
Keep holding your breath Susan,
as long as you can.

804
00:57:37,653 --> 00:57:39,999
Directional stability is 33/10...

805
00:57:40,099 --> 00:57:42,914
rise is steady, pitch is eight
degrees.

806
00:57:43,013 --> 00:57:45,080
Your balance is getting better!

807
00:57:51,515 --> 00:57:52,915
Hey.

808
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,213
They're gonna send me on a
project.

809
00:57:57,574 --> 00:57:58,974
Like Ben?

810
00:57:59,056 --> 00:58:00,792
We should use these powers to
do something.

811
00:58:00,793 --> 00:58:01,679
They're not powers...

812
00:58:01,779 --> 00:58:03,791
they're aggressively abnormal
physical conditions...

813
00:58:03,891 --> 00:58:04,541
Okay, all right.
that we're gonna fix.

814
00:58:04,641 --> 00:58:07,028
Can you turn that off?
And what if they can't?

815
00:58:07,128 --> 00:58:08,804
What if it takes more time to
get it right?

816
00:58:08,904 --> 00:58:10,261
We could be talking years.

817
00:58:10,392 --> 00:58:12,125
I am not going to be a tool.

818
00:58:15,288 --> 00:58:16,688
Johnny.
Stan, you ready?

819
00:58:16,833 --> 00:58:18,833
Yes, we are.
Flame on.

820
00:58:23,067 --> 00:58:24,934
Okay, Johnny.
Thank you, Sue.

821
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:30,530
Don't forget, we're here to get
our lives back.

822
00:58:35,547 --> 00:58:39,327
The subjects have agreed to
cooperate with us until we find...

823
00:58:39,339 --> 00:58:42,879
the source of their powers and,
potentially, cure them.

824
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:44,977
Why don't we go see the big
guy?

825
00:58:53,590 --> 00:58:56,421
Hi, Ben. I've got some friends
of mine...

826
00:58:56,521 --> 00:58:58,968
here from Washington D.C.,
visiting.

827
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:00,838
You got a second to say hello?

828
00:59:05,323 --> 00:59:07,723
It's an honor to meet you,
Mr. Grimm.

829
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:10,287
We appreciate all you're doing
for us.

830
00:59:10,428 --> 00:59:13,202
Well, that was the deal, right?

831
00:59:13,296 --> 00:59:16,505
And there she is, the Quantum
Gate herself...

832
00:59:16,605 --> 00:59:18,740
the, uh... star of the show.

833
00:59:19,809 --> 00:59:21,209
Franklin.

834
00:59:21,869 --> 00:59:24,686
I'd like for you all to meet
Franklin Storm...

835
00:59:24,886 --> 00:59:27,155
who is our supervisor here on
the floor.

836
00:59:27,255 --> 00:59:29,191
How do you do, Sir?
Good morning.

837
00:59:29,249 --> 00:59:30,899
How long until it's ready?

838
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,935
Well, we've had a few issues,
but we're getting closer.

839
00:59:34,035 --> 00:59:35,881
Closer, every day.

840
00:59:36,542 --> 00:59:39,942
All right, Dr. Allen.
We'll give you what you need.

841
00:59:40,186 --> 00:59:42,147
In the meantime, we'd like to
put more of your subjects...

842
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:43,610
in the field.

843
00:59:43,745 --> 00:59:44,905
Subject 2 is ready to go.

844
00:59:45,321 --> 00:59:46,988
Get him ready for combat.

845
00:59:50,989 --> 00:59:52,389
Susan!

846
00:59:53,537 --> 00:59:55,337
Can I have a word with you?

847
01:00:03,738 --> 01:00:06,271
They're sending Johnny into
the field.

848
01:00:06,443 --> 01:00:09,072
You mean he's sending himself
into the field.

849
01:00:09,073 --> 01:00:11,366
The only way to stop him is to
cure him.

850
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:14,317
And that means finishing the
gate.

851
01:00:14,836 --> 01:00:16,903
I can't finish it without Reed.

852
01:00:17,082 --> 01:00:18,615
Reed's not coming back.

853
01:00:18,932 --> 01:00:20,932
He abandoned us, left us here.

854
01:00:21,055 --> 01:00:23,758
He was afraid. He didn't know
what this place was.

855
01:00:23,759 --> 01:00:25,541
I can't believe you're still
defending him.

856
01:00:25,542 --> 01:00:27,154
Help me track him down, Susan.

857
01:00:27,172 --> 01:00:28,572
He'll listen to you.

858
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:32,337
We'll reopen the gate, find
a cure, end this.

859
01:00:36,072 --> 01:00:37,539
Johnny's your brother.

860
01:00:38,654 --> 01:00:42,054
It's never been as easy for
him, as it has for you.

861
01:00:42,433 --> 01:00:44,566
And like it or not, he's family.

862
01:00:45,593 --> 01:00:49,126
And family means we take care
of each other.

863
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:54,416
What can I do?

864
01:00:54,962 --> 01:00:59,362
The FBI, CIA, and NSA have blips
of Reed here and there.

865
01:01:00,226 --> 01:01:03,226
But they can't seem to see...
The pattern.

866
01:01:04,548 --> 01:01:05,948
Pattern.

867
01:01:06,543 --> 01:01:08,076
Where was he last seen?

868
01:01:08,888 --> 01:01:10,688
Three months ago, in Panama.

869
01:01:10,735 --> 01:01:12,135
Did you get an IP?

870
01:01:12,214 --> 01:01:15,469
Early on, he was using some
old buried e-mail accounts.

871
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:19,047
Bouncing off satellites, he's
keeping himself pretty well hidden.

872
01:01:19,048 --> 01:01:21,033
For a short while we were able
to ping him here and there.

873
01:01:21,034 --> 01:01:22,767
Caught him on a few sites.

874
01:01:22,819 --> 01:01:25,886
He was looking for scrap metal,
buying parts.

875
01:01:25,957 --> 01:01:29,554
Never stayed online that long.
Is he looking for anything else?

876
01:01:29,555 --> 01:01:31,088
He was searching for him.

877
01:01:38,516 --> 01:01:41,835
I'm gonna need some music.
Excuse me?

878
01:01:41,836 --> 01:01:43,970
Any music.
It helps me think.

879
01:02:37,233 --> 01:02:38,633
Gracias.

880
01:04:09,175 --> 01:04:10,575
Captain Nemo.

881
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,431
That's him.

882
01:04:14,242 --> 01:04:17,109
He's routing his e-mails through
this relay.

883
01:04:17,288 --> 01:04:20,288
Got him.
You did what you had to do.

884
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,560
Hi, Ben.

885
01:04:29,299 --> 01:04:31,549
We've got another project
for you.

886
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:33,864
I think you're gonna like
this one.

887
01:04:49,357 --> 01:04:50,757
Freeze!
Do not move!

888
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:57,396
Get down!
On the ground!

889
01:05:05,719 --> 01:05:07,119
Freeze!

890
01:05:13,201 --> 01:05:14,601
Oh, my God, Ben!

891
01:05:15,316 --> 01:05:17,639
So, this is where you been
hiding out.

892
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,695
Wait, stop.
Okay, let me explain.

893
01:05:21,383 --> 01:05:24,641
Why?
I'm no good to you, to anyone.

894
01:05:24,642 --> 01:05:27,842
This is all my fault.
That, we can agree on.

895
01:05:39,085 --> 01:05:40,485
Does it hurt?

896
01:05:43,307 --> 01:05:44,707
I'm used to it.

897
01:05:46,655 --> 01:05:48,055
I'm sorry.

898
01:05:51,065 --> 01:05:53,399
That's what you said when
you left.

899
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:58,167
I'm going to fix this.

900
01:05:58,668 --> 01:06:00,068
You can't fix this.

901
01:06:02,889 --> 01:06:04,289
Nobody can.

902
01:06:07,265 --> 01:06:09,732
I promise you, I'm going to
fix this.

903
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:15,230
I stopped believing in your
bullshit, a long time ago.

904
01:06:18,359 --> 01:06:19,959
You were my best friend.

905
01:06:25,694 --> 01:06:27,094
Look at me.

906
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,360
I'm not your friend.

907
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:40,416
You turned me into something
else.

908
01:07:02,692 --> 01:07:04,092
Nice work, Ben.

909
01:07:52,394 --> 01:07:53,794
Hey, Reed.

910
01:07:57,070 --> 01:07:59,870
Look, I'm sorry, but I didn't
have a choice.

911
01:08:00,401 --> 01:08:02,868
We need your help to finish
the gate.

912
01:08:03,082 --> 01:08:05,597
It's the only chance we have to
figure out what happened to us...

913
01:08:05,697 --> 01:08:07,399
and reverse it.

914
01:08:08,788 --> 01:08:11,521
You really think that they care
about us?

915
01:08:11,845 --> 01:08:13,845
You know how they've used Ben.

916
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:19,650
Yeah.

917
01:08:20,324 --> 01:08:21,724
I do.

918
01:08:22,312 --> 01:08:24,202
And they're gonna do the same
thing to Johnny...

919
01:08:24,302 --> 01:08:26,071
if we don't stop them.

920
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:32,704
The only shot we've got is on
the other side of that gate.

921
01:08:35,153 --> 01:08:38,353
Do you ever wonder what life
would've been like...

922
01:08:40,396 --> 01:08:43,663
if you hadn't come to the
Science Fair, that day?

923
01:08:46,378 --> 01:08:48,045
We can't change the past.

924
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:52,997
But we can change the future.

925
01:08:53,876 --> 01:08:57,343
You said you wanted your work
to make a difference.

926
01:08:58,824 --> 01:09:00,224
This is it.

927
01:09:01,285 --> 01:09:02,685
This is your chance.

928
01:09:09,905 --> 01:09:11,305
You ready?

929
01:09:46,917 --> 01:09:48,317
You made it ugly.

930
01:09:56,949 --> 01:09:59,015
It's good to see you again,
son.

931
01:10:12,068 --> 01:10:13,868
I'm gonna need ten minutes.

932
01:10:13,878 --> 01:10:15,278
To do what?

933
01:10:15,638 --> 01:10:17,591
I need to make a couple adjustments
to the source code...

934
01:10:17,691 --> 01:10:19,728
you have a few steps that are
out of order.

935
01:10:20,351 --> 01:10:21,794
It can't be that simple.

936
01:10:21,888 --> 01:10:24,700
It might not be ten minutes,
could be a little less.

937
01:10:24,701 --> 01:10:26,101
Come on, let's go.

938
01:10:33,643 --> 01:10:37,243
I've got a good feeling Stan,
I'm gonna crack five seconds.

939
01:10:40,379 --> 01:10:43,177
Hey, could I take a couple
minutes with my son?

940
01:10:43,178 --> 01:10:44,578
Sure, no problem.

941
01:10:46,046 --> 01:10:48,112
Guys, can you give us five
minutes?

942
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:50,353
What's going on?

943
01:10:51,355 --> 01:10:55,155
Reed is back. We're closer than
we've ever been before.

944
01:10:56,437 --> 01:10:57,837
Closer to what?

945
01:11:00,085 --> 01:11:01,485
Our old lives.

946
01:11:01,721 --> 01:11:03,788
Oh, you mean your life.
No, son.

947
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:05,242
You always said I had the
potential...

948
01:11:05,342 --> 01:11:08,268
to do something important.
Who's to say this isn't it?

949
01:11:08,456 --> 01:11:10,757
Sometimes things just happen
for a reason.

950
01:11:10,758 --> 01:11:13,797
Johnny, you have no idea what
they are planning to do to you.

951
01:11:13,798 --> 01:11:17,271
They're not doing anything to
me, I'm doing this with them.

952
01:11:18,314 --> 01:11:20,024
Johnny, you need to listen
to me.

953
01:11:20,124 --> 01:11:21,715
I did listen to you, and that's
what got me here...

954
01:11:21,815 --> 01:11:23,405
in the first place.

955
01:11:25,368 --> 01:11:29,102
I'm an adult. I'm old enough
to make my own decisions.

956
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,600
Clear for launch.

957
01:11:37,152 --> 01:11:38,552
Stand by.

958
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:45,820
Look who it is.

959
01:11:45,998 --> 01:11:47,398
Hey.

960
01:11:51,439 --> 01:11:54,539
It's good seeing you, man.
Good to see you, too.

961
01:11:56,143 --> 01:11:57,743
Sonic projectors engaged.

962
01:11:58,414 --> 01:11:59,814
Goggles up.

963
01:12:10,955 --> 01:12:12,355
Initiating launch.

964
01:12:22,428 --> 01:12:25,228
Systems check, complete.
We have a visual.

965
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:29,230
Roger that, Control. Are you
receiving atmospheric data?

966
01:12:29,231 --> 01:12:30,631
Copy that.

967
01:12:38,393 --> 01:12:39,926
Checking configuration.

968
01:12:41,634 --> 01:12:43,567
Data transmission looks good.

969
01:12:44,251 --> 01:12:45,851
The landscape's changed.

970
01:12:46,908 --> 01:12:48,308
How?

971
01:12:48,686 --> 01:12:50,953
I don't know, it's just different.

972
01:12:51,436 --> 01:12:54,236
Commencing element/geological
test series.

973
01:12:54,347 --> 01:12:55,747
Copy.

974
01:13:02,342 --> 01:13:04,484
Hey control, I'm picking up
a heat signature...

975
01:13:04,784 --> 01:13:07,076
about 60 yards away.

976
01:13:07,754 --> 01:13:09,287
Now, what could that be?

977
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:13,819
Hard to make out.
The signal keeps fluctuating.

978
01:13:15,065 --> 01:13:17,532
It's moving, heading towards us.

979
01:13:18,316 --> 01:13:20,916
Copy that.
Proceed with caution.

980
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:32,030
Do you have a visual?

981
01:13:33,804 --> 01:13:35,804
It appears to be a human form...

982
01:13:36,585 --> 01:13:39,518
with some sort of foreign
element, around it.

983
01:13:47,062 --> 01:13:49,462
I knew you would come back.

984
01:13:50,328 --> 01:13:52,828
Victor?
Not possible.

985
01:14:03,048 --> 01:14:04,648
Subject appears injured.

986
01:14:06,093 --> 01:14:08,188
Get the med kit.
Let's get him to the shuttle.

987
01:14:08,189 --> 01:14:09,989
Okay.
Now, easy, guys. Come on!

988
01:14:09,996 --> 01:14:11,529
Abort.
Bring him back.

989
01:14:12,435 --> 01:14:16,768
Aborting mission. Stabilizing
subject. Prepare for transport.

990
01:14:18,188 --> 01:14:19,588
Preparing for launch!

991
01:14:24,288 --> 01:14:27,154
Transfer the subject to
Containment Room 1.

992
01:14:27,404 --> 01:14:28,804
Copy that.

993
01:14:31,264 --> 01:14:34,197
His thermal signature is barely
registering.

994
01:14:34,745 --> 01:14:37,079
His biochemistry is off the
charts.

995
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:41,446
I want to talk to him.

996
01:14:41,701 --> 01:14:43,768
Nobody talks to him until I do.

997
01:14:44,791 --> 01:14:47,257
Confine the others to their
quarters.

998
01:15:20,626 --> 01:15:22,026
Victor?

999
01:15:23,667 --> 01:15:26,934
We don't know how you survived
over there, but...

1000
01:15:26,935 --> 01:15:29,600
we're still analyzing the data.

1001
01:15:31,388 --> 01:15:33,086
It appears that...

1002
01:15:33,966 --> 01:15:36,995
the environment suit fused
with your body, but...

1003
01:15:37,191 --> 01:15:39,098
we're working on that.

1004
01:15:39,311 --> 01:15:41,444
We're going to help you, Victor.

1005
01:15:41,812 --> 01:15:44,345
We're working with the
government, now.

1006
01:15:45,685 --> 01:15:49,380
We're going to send more expeditions
to the other side, but first...

1007
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:53,224
you need to tell us everything
you know about that place.

1008
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:57,223
You want to know how I survived?

1009
01:15:58,698 --> 01:16:01,165
That place kept me alive.

1010
01:16:02,405 --> 01:16:05,405
Gave me strength, power.

1011
01:16:08,371 --> 01:16:10,342
What kind of power?

1012
01:16:10,461 --> 01:16:14,161
The kind, men like you must
never possess.

1013
01:16:22,683 --> 01:16:24,817
You couldn't resist coming
back.

1014
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,933
It's not enough to ruin your
world.

1015
01:16:29,246 --> 01:16:32,268
Now you want to ruin mine.

1016
01:16:32,759 --> 01:16:34,159
Victor...

1017
01:16:36,903 --> 01:16:42,036
If this world must die so that
mine may live, so be it.

1018
01:17:12,533 --> 01:17:14,066
Code Red.

1019
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:16,762
There is an emergency in this
building.

1020
01:17:17,647 --> 01:17:20,047
Follow standard emergency
protocols.

1021
01:17:21,229 --> 01:17:25,424
Proceed to the nearest exit and
leave the building, immediately.

1022
01:17:25,425 --> 01:17:26,825
Code Red, Code Red.

1023
01:17:29,397 --> 01:17:31,464
...in this building.

1024
01:17:32,421 --> 01:17:34,821
Follow standard emergency
protocols.

1025
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,520
Code Red.
Got to get outside!

1026
01:17:43,879 --> 01:17:46,079
Hurry, go, go, go!
Get out of here!

1027
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:02,119
Code Red, Code Red.

1028
01:18:03,217 --> 01:18:06,418
There is an emergency in this
building.

1029
01:18:06,419 --> 01:18:08,752
Follow standard emergency
protocol.

1030
01:18:09,999 --> 01:18:14,265
Proceed to the nearest exit and
leave the building, immediately.

1031
01:18:23,266 --> 01:18:24,666
Running away, again?

1032
01:18:29,138 --> 01:18:30,538
No.

1033
01:18:53,547 --> 01:18:54,947
Sue!

1034
01:18:57,348 --> 01:18:58,748
My bad, are you okay?

1035
01:18:59,338 --> 01:19:00,738
Yeah, I'm all right.

1036
01:19:02,566 --> 01:19:03,966
Where's dad?

1037
01:19:14,188 --> 01:19:16,388
Victor, no.
Just stop!

1038
01:19:16,456 --> 01:19:19,156
Out of my way, Franklin.
I'm going home.

1039
01:19:19,311 --> 01:19:20,778
This is your home, son.

1040
01:19:21,672 --> 01:19:23,072
Not anymore.

1041
01:19:23,156 --> 01:19:25,490
There's nothing for you, over
there.

1042
01:19:25,644 --> 01:19:28,711
Only the power to create a
new world.

1043
01:19:29,810 --> 01:19:31,277
Victor, we're not gods.

1044
01:19:31,798 --> 01:19:33,198
We're just people.

1045
01:19:33,829 --> 01:19:37,029
And we are stronger together,
than we are apart.

1046
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:39,373
What good is it, if you're
alone?

1047
01:19:39,932 --> 01:19:42,099
I have always been alone.

1048
01:19:42,345 --> 01:19:43,745
Victor, stop!

1049
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,200
Just stop.

1050
01:19:50,857 --> 01:19:52,257
It's too late, Susan.

1051
01:19:53,190 --> 01:19:57,257
The Earth is dying.
Humanity had its chance.

1052
01:20:00,496 --> 01:20:01,896
No!
Dad!

1053
01:20:04,878 --> 01:20:06,278
Dad!
No!

1054
01:20:06,887 --> 01:20:08,287
Dad, no! I'm Sorry!
No!

1055
01:20:13,135 --> 01:20:14,535
No!
Dad, move!

1056
01:20:14,585 --> 01:20:15,985
Victor!
No!

1057
01:20:23,112 --> 01:20:24,512
Promise me.

1058
01:20:25,807 --> 01:20:29,087
Look after each other.

1059
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:34,220
Dad, I'm sorry!
Dad, I'm sorry...

1060
01:20:35,701 --> 01:20:37,101
No!

1061
01:20:56,767 --> 01:20:59,743
He's overloading the system
to create a runaway reaction.

1062
01:20:59,744 --> 01:21:00,967
It's not gonna stop!

1063
01:21:01,067 --> 01:21:03,914
It'll create a black hole
that'll swallow the Earth!

1064
01:21:36,897 --> 01:21:40,230
It's pulling everything into
the other dimension.

1065
01:21:40,379 --> 01:21:41,779
Hold on.

1066
01:22:10,630 --> 01:22:12,028
Johnny!

1067
01:22:12,029 --> 01:22:13,429
Got it.

1068
01:22:38,755 --> 01:22:41,882
The matter from Earth is being
converted to energy.

1069
01:22:41,883 --> 01:22:44,276
We need to stop Victor, he's
the source.

1070
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:46,039
He's mine.

1071
01:22:52,705 --> 01:22:54,105
I have an idea.

1072
01:22:54,487 --> 01:22:55,887
This is what I do.

1073
01:23:58,406 --> 01:24:00,406
Where are you, Susan?

1074
01:24:11,021 --> 01:24:12,488
Victor, don't do this!

1075
01:24:13,687 --> 01:24:15,087
There is no Victor.

1076
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:18,251
There is only Doom.

1077
01:24:47,011 --> 01:24:49,611
I saw a different future for
us, Susan.

1078
01:25:02,198 --> 01:25:03,598
Help me!
Reed!

1079
01:25:05,577 --> 01:25:06,977
Ben.

1080
01:25:15,241 --> 01:25:16,641
Goodbye, Susan.

1081
01:26:22,141 --> 01:26:23,541
Reed!

1082
01:26:25,990 --> 01:26:27,390
Is he dead?

1083
01:26:27,746 --> 01:26:30,131
If that thing's still active,
so is he.

1084
01:26:30,132 --> 01:26:33,182
We can't beat him.
He's stronger than any of us.

1085
01:26:33,598 --> 01:26:37,065
Yeah, he is. But he's not stronger
than all of us.

1086
01:26:37,921 --> 01:26:39,623
Look, this place gave him his
powers...

1087
01:26:39,723 --> 01:26:41,867
but it gave us all of ours, too.

1088
01:26:42,349 --> 01:26:43,749
It's who we are, now.

1089
01:26:44,675 --> 01:26:46,875
Maybe it's who we're meant
to be.

1090
01:26:47,587 --> 01:26:50,454
We opened this door, we're
gonna close it.

1091
01:26:51,694 --> 01:26:53,094
So, what's the plan?

1092
01:27:06,643 --> 01:27:08,043
Enough!

1093
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:12,230
When your world's destroyed
and I'm all that's left...

1094
01:27:12,231 --> 01:27:14,464
then it will be enough.

1095
01:27:51,399 --> 01:27:54,799
Always so smug, thinking you
were smarter than me.

1096
01:27:59,436 --> 01:28:00,902
I am smarter than you.

1097
01:28:03,145 --> 01:28:05,495
Now!
Hey!

1098
01:28:05,496 --> 01:28:06,896
It's clobbering time!

1099
01:28:14,510 --> 01:28:15,910
This better work.

1100
01:28:46,838 --> 01:28:48,904
Let's get the hell outta here!

1101
01:29:25,558 --> 01:29:28,405
While the world may not know
what you did to save it...

1102
01:29:28,406 --> 01:29:30,050
the men and the women in this
room, do.

1103
01:29:30,091 --> 01:29:31,824
And so does the President.

1104
01:29:31,972 --> 01:29:35,972
That said, we'd like to continue
our existing relationship.

1105
01:29:36,881 --> 01:29:38,281
So...

1106
01:29:38,818 --> 01:29:41,618
if we're all in agreement?
We're not.

1107
01:29:42,046 --> 01:29:43,446
Excuse me?

1108
01:29:43,664 --> 01:29:46,005
We're not remotely all in
agreement.

1109
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:49,165
We don't need you, or anybody
else to keep an eye on us.

1110
01:29:49,166 --> 01:29:50,992
We just want a place where we
can work.

1111
01:29:50,993 --> 01:29:53,601
And whatever we come up with
belongs to us.

1112
01:29:54,377 --> 01:29:56,344
And what if we say no?

1113
01:30:00,409 --> 01:30:01,809
Say yes.

1114
01:30:03,035 --> 01:30:05,435
How much space are we talking
about?

1115
01:30:07,406 --> 01:30:08,806
A lot.

1116
01:30:23,506 --> 01:30:28,455
Oh, boy! So, uh, I thought there
were going to be four of you.

1117
01:30:28,456 --> 01:30:29,856
Oh, there is.

1118
01:30:34,980 --> 01:30:39,023
Labs are upstairs, engineering's
on the south side, and...

1119
01:30:39,495 --> 01:30:41,585
assembly's downstairs.

1120
01:30:41,791 --> 01:30:44,125
We've been operating out of
here for...

1121
01:30:44,549 --> 01:30:47,953
over twelve years, now. Well,
officially, that is...

1122
01:30:48,183 --> 01:30:52,483
but you still won't find our
name on any government books.

1123
01:30:52,524 --> 01:30:56,958
Most people just refer to this
as, uh... Central City.

1124
01:30:57,576 --> 01:31:01,043
But, call it whatever you want.
We work for you, now.

1125
01:31:05,552 --> 01:31:06,839
Oh, wow!

1126
01:31:06,983 --> 01:31:10,664
Now, that's what I'm talking about.
That's pretty nice.

1127
01:31:10,799 --> 01:31:12,436
I'm taking that area over
there.

1128
01:31:13,501 --> 01:31:15,168
I could get used to this.

1129
01:31:16,474 --> 01:31:17,874
I got it!

1130
01:31:17,875 --> 01:31:20,860
The "Franklin-Storm Research
Center."

1131
01:31:20,951 --> 01:31:24,312
Dad was kind of allergic to
his name in big letters.

1132
01:31:24,313 --> 01:31:25,612
Which reminds me, I think
that...

1133
01:31:25,712 --> 01:31:27,407
the four of us, should have
a name.

1134
01:31:27,507 --> 01:31:29,088
Why would we need a name?

1135
01:31:29,089 --> 01:31:31,491
Because we're a team now, and
there's four of us...

1136
01:31:31,591 --> 01:31:35,140
so, we should come up with a
name, for it.

1137
01:31:35,394 --> 01:31:38,327
I like "The Human Torch and
the Torchettes."

1138
01:31:38,992 --> 01:31:40,284
Ugh.
No.

1139
01:31:40,384 --> 01:31:41,996
You kidding me?

1140
01:31:42,031 --> 01:31:44,480
How about "The Big Brain and
his Neurons?"

1141
01:31:44,481 --> 01:31:46,730
How about "The Big Brain and
her Neurons?"

1142
01:31:46,731 --> 01:31:50,143
How about "Two Guys, a Girl, and
The Thing That Nobody Wanted?"

1143
01:31:50,404 --> 01:31:52,252
Hey, we both know that you
could take him.

1144
01:31:52,253 --> 01:31:53,653
Hey!
What?

1145
01:31:57,997 --> 01:32:00,597
We've come a long way, since
the garage.

1146
01:32:00,898 --> 01:32:04,131
Yeah, I'll say.
It's fantastic.

1147
01:32:08,721 --> 01:32:10,121
Say that again?

1148
01:32:11,405 --> 01:32:12,805
It's fantastic.

1149
01:32:14,234 --> 01:32:15,634
Yes, it is.

1150
01:32:16,467 --> 01:32:17,867
Guys, I got it!

1151
01:32:18,794 --> 01:32:20,194
Ready?
Yeah.
