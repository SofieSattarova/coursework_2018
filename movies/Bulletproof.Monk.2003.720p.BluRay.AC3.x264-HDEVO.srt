1
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,300
<i>…of my destiny
and the beginning of yours.</i>

2
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,920
<i>When you first came to me,</i>

3
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,930
<i>you were the most undisciplined
youth I had ever laid eyes on.</i>

4
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,270
And yet you proved yourself worthy

5
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,770
to be the next guardian.

6
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,270
You have fulfilled
the three noble prophesies.

7
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,980
You defeated an army of enemies

8
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,730
while a flock of cranes circled above.

9
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,860
And then you battled for love
in the Palace of Jade.

10
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,530
And finally,

11
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,830
you freed brothers you never knew

12
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,620
with the family you never had.

13
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,790
Now you must make the final sacrifice.

14
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,410
You must give up your name.

15
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,750
I have already forgotten it, Master.

16
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,510
The Scroll of the Ultimate.

17
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,720
Whoever reads its words
out loud in their entirety

18
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,350
will gain the power to control the world

19
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,350
and turn it into a paradise or a living hell.

20
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,230
Mankind is not ready for so much power

21
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,820
and may never be.

22
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,160
That is why it is our duty
to protect the scroll

23
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,280
from being read by anyone,
including ourselves.

24
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,870
Five times the Year of the Ram has passed

25
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,370
since I became the next
from my honored predecessor,

26
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,800
and his master before him,
and so on, and so on.

27
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,260
I have been protecting
the scroll for 60 years.

28
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,340
Now it is your turn.

29
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,090
It is done.

30
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,560
The next 60 years should be
very interesting for you.

31
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,450
It's time for me to do
what I've always wanted to do

32
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,040
ever since those pesky British
showed up in 1904.

33
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,250
What's that, Master?

34
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,500
Take a vacation.

35
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,800
The scroll.

36
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,010
You must protect scroll.

37
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,140
Master! Master!

38
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,740
Stay hidden, no matter what.

39
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,870
Go!

40
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,460
My brother monks,

41
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,300
you have seen the destructive power

42
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,340
which is mine to command.

43
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,720
I also have the power

44
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,060
to leave this blessed monastery in peace.

45
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,440
Enjoy your vacation, Master.

46
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,820
I trust you will do what's best for all of us

47
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,320
and step aside.

48
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,780
No?

49
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,800
Fire!

50
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,350
The scroll.

51
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,460
Okay, let's go in.

52
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,260
Anybody home?

53
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,230
I don't like monkeys.

54
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,060
The scroll.

55
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,610
You may be good
but you are not bulletproof.

56
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,220
Monk?

57
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,220
Monk?

58
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,510
Monk?

59
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,470
Monk!

60
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,860
Monk!

61
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,080
Rush hour.

62
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,050
I'm sorry. I'll get that. Sorry.

63
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,430
No problem.

64
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,770
Sorry.

65
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,700
You picked the wrong pocket
to pick, prick!

66
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,790
Sorry about that, Officer.

67
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,750
Nice cuffs.

68
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,960
Officer needs assistance.

69
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,470
<i>Six-foot Caucasian male,
black leather jacket.</i>

70
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,760
<i>Heading north, Bishop Square.</i>

71
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,140
On my way.

72
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,190
Do you see him?

73
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,480
Yep. Got him.

74
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,030
<i>Okay. Get in position. Wait for my move.</i>

75
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,990
<i>Confirming visual on the target.
I got him at 9:00.</i>

76
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,820
<i>Pick him up. We have a go.</i>

77
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,530
<i>Approaching target now.</i>

78
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,660
<i>– Hey!
– Go, go, go!</i>

79
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,000
<i>The target is on the run.
Don't let him get away!</i>

80
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,880
Hey! Stop!

81
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,920
<i>Bishop Square platform. Officer in pursuit!</i>

82
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,020
Hey, man, what's up?

83
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,190
Out of my way, punk! Knock it off!

84
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,040
Coming through!

85
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,210
Get out of the way!

86
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,500
Katie!

87
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,460
– Mommy!
– Oh, my God. Somebody get her!

88
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,220
How'd she get in there?

89
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,510
Katie!

90
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,140
Let's get out of here. Let's go!

91
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,600
Somebody help.

92
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,480
She's stuck. Grab her leg.

93
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,900
– Mommy.
– It's gonna be okay.

94
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,150
Do it!

95
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,110
Oh, my God!
Get her out of there!

96
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,740
It's gonna be okay.

97
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,240
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay, baby.

98
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,370
Get ready to pull!

99
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,550
You son of a bitch.
You just lost my whole stash.

100
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,720
Be happy. You helped save a human life.

101
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,890
Yeah, well, last time I checked
there's no reward for that.

102
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,650
Tell me, how did you do that back there?

103
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:21,980
Practice.

104
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,570
Who the hell are you, anyway?

105
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,650
That's not the question you need to ask.

106
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,200
You should be asking yourself
who you are.

107
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,030
Your mind is filled with compassion.

108
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,950
That's why you risked your life
to help the child.

109
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,960
But your mind is also impure.

110
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,870
So you forget the spiritual reward

111
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,960
and think only of the financial.

112
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,800
Well, if you're so pure,

113
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,840
why were all those guys in suits
chasing you?

114
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,050
It doesn't concern you.

115
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,680
Let me guess, FBI, CIA, INS.

116
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,220
I said it doesn't concern you.

117
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,270
Unbelievable.

118
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,150
I'm sorry!

119
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,740
Every man's life
concerns every other man,

120
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,200
especially if he is on the noble path

121
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,500
to true enlightenment.

122
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,000
Can you accept my apology?

123
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,680
Apology accepted.

124
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,890
– Thanks for helping me.
– No problem, man.

125
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,360
You're boosting in the wrong turf!

126
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,590
Get your punk ass over here.

127
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,170
Finger man here calls himself Kar.

128
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,680
He got caught ripping off marks
at the Bishop Square subway station.

129
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,720
Funktastic's the name

130
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,390
and profit's the game.

131
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,640
See, I'm a businessman.

132
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:24,440
And my fiscal policy toward crime
consists of two words,

133
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,060
zero tolerance.

134
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:31,610
Unless, of course, the criminal in question
has an officially authorized franchise.

135
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,900
And you ain't got one.

136
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,570
I'm supposed to pay you
for the right to rip people off?

137
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,910
That's right.
– 60% off the top.

138
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,410
This entitles you to squatter's rights

139
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,290
in Mr. Funktastic's cribs,

140
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,250
chow at his greasy spoons,

141
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:47,920
and protection provided by Mr. Funktastic
and his crew.

142
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,670
And that's us.

143
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,800
You know, it's really enticing.

144
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,430
But if this is an example
of a Funktastic crib,

145
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,470
I'm gonna check myself into a Motel 6.

146
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,940
That's good.

147
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,940
Pretty funny.

148
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,020
You'd be a corpse already, mate,
if not for the fact

149
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,610
I heard you're
an exceptionally good earner.

150
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,450
Maybe I heard wrong.

151
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,910
In which case, you're nothing to me, mate.

152
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,120
You're less than nothing.

153
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,120
Around here,
less than nothing means dead.

154
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,120
You heard right about me.

155
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,000
I just… I need some time
to think over your offer.

156
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,170
In the meantime, take this.

157
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,800
It's okay.

158
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,470
An offer of good faith.

159
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:43,310
What do you think I am, Kar,
a bloody tourist?

160
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,020
You come down here and try and palm

161
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,270
that made-in-a-Bangkok-sweatshop
piece of shit off on me?

162
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,170
You got big orchestras, mate.

163
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,340
Too bad I have to cut them off.

164
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,680
I have no idea what you just said.

165
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,100
Your balls.

166
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,060
He's gonna cut off your balls.

167
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,740
– Cut him, Diesel.
– He's mine.

168
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,400
Come on, shorty!

169
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,030
You done messed up, bro.

170
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,990
You're in for a treat now, boy.

171
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,240
You know what it's all about.

172
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,420
Jesus!

173
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,230
What the hell are you looking at?

174
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,230
You're just so damn beautiful,

175
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,480
especially when you're angry.

176
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,030
That's my bird.

177
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,460
<i>He will defeat an army of enemies</i>

178
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,670
<i>while a flock of cranes circles above.</i>

179
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,090
Impossible.

180
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,010
Besides,

181
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,970
he's going to lose.

182
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,500
Get up, boss, get up!

183
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,130
Come on, man!

184
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,010
Come on, Mr. F, take him!

185
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,340
– Get it?
– Got him.

186
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,010
Yeah, where you going now, baby?

187
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,180
– He's kind of nice.
– Yeah, work it.

188
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,020
Shit.

189
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,360
– You're over!
– Got no fancy shit now, huh?

190
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,820
It is over.

191
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:30,030
Hey, come on.
I'm bored with beating on this loser.

192
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,370
Besides, fighting always gets me hot.

193
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,630
Lucky for you,
this little bit of crumpet's come begging

194
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,590
for some of my funktastic love.

195
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,760
Me or my people ever see you boosting

196
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,310
in our territory again, mate,

197
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:54,930
I'm gonna snip your Hampton clean off,

198
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,230
mince it up and serve it as a shish kebab.

199
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,060
Now piss off.

200
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,230
Congratulations on your victory.

201
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,110
Though, technically,
you were saved by a girl.

202
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,980
It was your charm

203
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,570
that convinced the girl to lead them away.

204
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,700
Hey, Mr. Do-gooder, if you were watching

205
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,120
the whole thing back there,
how come you didn't help me out?

206
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,200
Because you stole from me.

207
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,160
Oh, yeah. That.

208
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:59,040
But your fighting is very impressive.

209
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,040
Where do you study?

210
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,460
Golden Palace.

211
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,130
Golden Palace?

212
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:10,590
You studied with the venerable
fighting monks of Jinn Gong?

213
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,470
Whatever, man.

214
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:16,810
Look, it's been really great spending
more quality time with you and all that,

215
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,890
but I gotta run, okay?

216
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,940
Sorry about stealing
your whatever the hell that is.

217
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,690
Good luck with that enlightenment stuff.

218
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:31,030
The most undisciplined youth
I have ever laid eyes on.

219
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,670
– Not so fast.
– Not so fast?

220
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,510
I've been trying to get down with you
for a bloody long right time,

221
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,930
and every time
we're about to go all the way

222
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,180
you up and run out on me.

223
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,180
Nobody knows where you go,
what you do.

224
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,600
No one knows anything about you.

225
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,350
You know I'm worth waiting for.

226
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,710
Sorry, baby. You're on my list,

227
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,840
but you're not at the top.

228
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,170
What?

229
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,840
Piss off, you little tart.

230
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,600
I'm finished with you.

231
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,020
Hey, girl. Where's your necklace?

232
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,850
Oh, shit.

233
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:55,110
Hey, shit! Come on! Let's go!

234
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,120
Relax, folks. Enjoy the intermission.

235
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,080
We have warm soda, stale popcorn,

236
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,920
and dried seaweed snacks
at the concession.

237
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,830
Hey, dick weed! Fix it!

238
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,750
– I'm on it. I'm on it.
– You missed the reel change.

239
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,050
Anybody asks for their money back,

240
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,760
I'm adding it to your rent.

241
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,220
They already saw half of it.

242
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,090
And I'm through taking your messages!

243
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,930
My name is Kojima,

244
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,640
not Sony, Sanyo, Toshiba.

245
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,310
Whoever heard of a Japanese guy

246
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,440
owning a Chinese movie theater anyway?

247
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,480
I heard that, you smart-ass!

248
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,400
You have two choices, Kar.

249
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,820
You can sit on your butt and do nothing

250
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:40,450
or fly like a phoenix from
the ashes of your pathetic life.

251
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,040
I'm flying. I'm flying!

252
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,420
People, relax.

253
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:50,590
Come on, projection boy!

254
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:54,130
Hey, I'm tired of the white screen!
Give me some color here! Hey!

255
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,910
So, this is the Golden Palace
where you learn how to fight.

256
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,960
What the hell are you doing here?

257
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:34,170
I should have known
from your sloppy technique.

258
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,630
This is my place, okay?

259
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,640
Get out right now.

260
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:47,430
An enlightened man would offer
a humble traveler shelter for the night

261
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,520
and share a quiet conversation
over a bowl of Cocoa Puffs.

262
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,360
Really?

263
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,860
Well, I guess I ain't that enlightened.

264
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,860
'Cause I was thinking more
of kicking your freaky ass

265
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:04,700
back to wherever the hell it comes from.

266
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:12,380
For someone who says
he wants to kick my freaky ass,

267
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,380
you do a lot of talking.

268
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,050
Really?

269
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,130
Well,

270
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,890
I warned you, old man.

271
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,730
Got a little quickness in you, don't you?

272
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,740
Okay. Fine.

273
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,080
Guess I can't make you get out.

274
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,590
I overheard people calling you «car.»

275
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,800
Spelled with a «K.» It's Cantonese.

276
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,100
Funny. You don't look Cantonese.

277
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,770
It means «family,» okay?

278
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,560
I figure I never had one growing up,

279
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,100
but from now on I'll never be without it.

280
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:18,110
I'm afraid you are mispronouncing
your name, sir.

281
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,440
It should sound more like «ga.»

282
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,450
Look, it's my name, okay?

283
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:27,370
I'll pronounce it however I want.

284
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,370
What about you? What's your name?

285
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,960
I don't have one.

286
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,920
What do you mean?

287
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,540
You gave yourself a name. I gave mine up.

288
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,460
Hey, what are you doing?

289
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,130
Put that down. Come on.

290
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:49,850
All right. This is a Rolex.
You don't touch that.

291
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,140
I know.

292
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:53,850
So,

293
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,020
why did you steal the girl's necklace?

294
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,150
I didn't steal it.

295
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,690
I just… I borrowed it.

296
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,490
Look, I think she's into me.

297
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:09,280
I mean, I know she's into me.

298
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:12,370
So, I'm gonna return her «lost» necklace,

299
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,500
thereby making her
instantly indebted to me

300
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,330
and placing me
instantly in her good graces.

301
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,460
Deeply in her good graces.

302
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,000
It's foolproof.

303
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,010
Except for one fool, which would be you.

304
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:31,640
If she realizes what you did,
your entire plan will backfire.

305
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,730
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

306
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,860
You're sleeping in my bed?

307
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,400
It is quite comfortable, thank you.

308
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:47,450
You're absolutely crazy.

309
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:51,080
You eat my food. You sleep in my bed.

310
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,040
That's great.

311
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:56,870
You can at least tell me
why those guys were chasing you.

312
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,250
All right.

313
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:05,550
Let me put it in language
you will understand.

314
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,760
Okay.

315
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:12,050
Why do hot dogs come in packages of 10,

316
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,810
while hot dog buns
come in packages of just eight?

317
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,060
What the hell is that?

318
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,980
You can't answer my question
with another question,

319
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,740
especially one as stupid as that.

320
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,320
When you attain a state of enlightenment

321
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,070
that allows you to answer my question,

322
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,450
I will answer yours.

323
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,250
Good night.

324
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,040
What?

325
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,200
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

326
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,530
As the newly-appointed executive director

327
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,330
of the Human Rights Organization,

328
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:59,330
I would like to welcome you all here today.

329
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:02,080
Please, pardon our appearance.

330
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,210
As you can see,
we're still under construction.

331
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,670
But we wanted you,
our most generous supporters,

332
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:11,340
to have a preview of our new exhibit.

333
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,930
You see, out of the rubble that was Europe
at the end of World War II,

334
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:19,810
men and women of good will,
people like yourselves,

335
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:25,270
decided to build an organization dedicated
to the prevention of human rights abuses

336
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,190
all around the Earth.

337
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,860
And today I am here to tell you

338
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,240
we failed.

339
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:37,200
Thanks to all of you
and many others like you,

340
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,660
we are able to continue this fight.

341
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,870
This fight against hate,

342
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:45,920
violence, oppression, and cruelty
in all its forms.

343
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,090
– Excuse me?
– Yes?

344
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:58,140
Do you ever worry that some of the people
that come here may be inspired?

345
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,850
I hope each and every person
who comes here will be inspired.

346
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:03,230
I mean, inspired to do it again.

347
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:04,890
Oh.

348
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,900
Well, granted. There are an awful lot
of sick people in this world.

349
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:11,530
But, thankfully, most of them
don't attend our functions.

350
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,400
I have an idea.

351
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,030
How about instead of showing atrocity,

352
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:23,080
you do an exhibit that shows
man's humanity towards man?

353
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:27,250
You don't help anyone
by shielding them from reality.

354
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,250
Tell me.

355
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,590
Deep down inside,

356
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,260
in the very bottom of your soul,

357
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,430
who would you choose to be?

358
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,850
The one about to be shot

359
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,980
or the one about to do the shooting?

360
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,940
I really must go. It's been a pleasure.

361
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,760
Thank you.

362
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,220
Thank you.

363
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,890
What's going on?

364
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,100
The event was quite successful.

365
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,390
That's not what I'm talking about.

366
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,140
Have you found it?

367
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,060
Yes. Now,

368
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,360
unfortunately, we also lost it.

369
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,610
I am surrounded by weakness and failure.

370
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,990
No. That was before.

371
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,160
Now I'm here.

372
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,500
You are surrounded
by respect, admiration,

373
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,920
and love.

374
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,220
We'll find the scroll.
It's only a matter of time.

375
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,510
Time

376
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,260
is the one thing I'm running out of.

377
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,190
For 60 years,
I have been chasing the scroll.

378
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:13,360
It holds the power to rejuvenate me,

379
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,690
to make me young again,

380
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:19,950
and to finally cleanse the world
of all inferior races,

381
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:23,450
as it should have been cleansed
all those years ago.

382
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,540
That's the power

383
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,040
you let slip through your fingers, Nina.

384
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:36,380
I have men combing the city
as we speak, Opa.

385
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,720
Here you go. All right. Who's next?

386
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,880
– Plain with mustard, please.
– Okay.

387
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,390
All right. Coming right up, ma'am.

388
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:47,850
Hey! Watch it.

389
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,560
Excuse me, sir!

390
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,900
I believe you dropped this.

391
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,700
– Thank you. Thank you.
– You're welcome.

392
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,830
What the hell was that?

393
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,660
Sleight of hand.

394
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,580
I thought I was through with you.

395
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,960
Now you show up again
and you're picking my pocket?

396
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,920
The pocket was yours,
but not what I picked.

397
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,460
Don't you have anything better to do
than follow me around

398
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,670
and screw up my attempts
to make a little extra cash?

399
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,760
– Here you go.
– Thanks, man.

400
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,300
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

401
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,680
Whoa, whoa.

402
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,430
What? You got something
against hot dogs now?

403
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,310
'Cause if I remember correctly,

404
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,690
last night you were using them
to try to teach me ultimate enlightenment.

405
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:41,860
I was translating universal truth
into words you would understand,

406
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:43,780
but this.

407
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:48,120
To keep the body pure
one must not kill any living creature.

408
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:51,450
I didn't kill it. I'm gonna eat it.

409
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:56,460
And by the way, I got the answer
to your little question from last night.

410
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,630
– Yeah?
– Yeah. Check this out.

411
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,460
The reason hot dogs
come in packages of 10

412
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,880
and hot dog buns
come in packages of just eight

413
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:06,390
is that you always need more buns
for your hot dogs.

414
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,720
So no matter how much you get,

415
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,470
how much you win,
or how much you achieve,

416
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,980
you can never ever let yourself feel
like it's enough.

417
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,520
No, but good try.

418
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:23,650
You know, for a guy I barely know,
you're really starting to annoy me.

419
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:27,280
Knowing others means you are wise,

420
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:31,200
but knowing yourself
means you are enlightened.

421
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,660
Enough with all this
fortune-cookie philosophy, okay?

422
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,000
<i>Target in sight.</i>

423
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,340
<i>Hold your position.</i>

424
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,000
This is America.

425
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:46,010
We don't have enlightenment here.
We have Big Macs, strip clubs,

426
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:49,260
shopping malls, Las Vegas and HBO!

427
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,510
You got it?

428
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,270
Hey, you! Kar!

429
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,910
Hey.

430
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:12,240
You don't quite look
like the bad girl you did last night.

431
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,700
My necklace.

432
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,870
– Excuse me?
– Last night I lost my necklace.

433
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:22,380
Something tells me you may have an idea
of how I can get it back.

434
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:29,300
Well, I guess I could keep
my eyes and my ears open.

435
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:32,510
– What's in it for me?
– It belonged to my mom.

436
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:35,220
It's important to me.

437
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,060
I guess I'd owe you one.

438
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,730
Who is your friend?

439
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,480
Him?

440
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:48,150
He's my personal bodyguard.
Watches my back.

441
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,530
He's an incredibly deadly Shaolin monk.
Ten fingers, ten toes.

442
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,080
Twenty reasons to die.

443
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,040
Shaolin monks
shave their heads every day.

444
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,290
You're no Shaolin monk.

445
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,550
Tibetan Buddhist, maybe?

446
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,300
This young lady is nobody's fool.

447
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,660
Yeah, tell me about it.

448
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,290
You know,

449
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:43,420
last night was the first time
that I've ever seen anybody

450
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,380
stand up to Funktastic.

451
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,010
Incredibly brave

452
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:51,010
and incredibly stupid at the same time.

453
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,260
Interesting mix.

454
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,140
I'm sorry. I have to go.

455
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,640
Where you going?

456
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,090
Over there!

457
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,130
There they are! Come on!

458
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,130
Sorry, man! This is your fight, not mine!
Good luck!

459
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,560
Oh, shit!

460
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,070
Come on! Come on!

461
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,280
Thought about it, man!

462
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,870
– Couldn't just leave you hanging like that!
– Watch out!

463
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,050
Man down!

464
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,650
Kar, let's go!

465
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,570
This way.

466
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,410
These guys don't give up easy.

467
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:40,370
They haven't for 60 years.

468
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,620
Hold up!

469
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,430
Inside! Quick!

470
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,270
Come on.

471
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:20,660
<i>Where did he go?
– I don't know. We had him.</i>

472
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,780
Out the back! They went out the back!

473
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:24,080
<i>Go, go.</i>

474
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,890
Wow, you're really popular.

475
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,270
Brother Tenzin.

476
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,110
Brother.

477
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,190
Allow me to offer you
a place to freshen up

478
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,780
and a cup of our finest butter tea.

479
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,990
Please.

480
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:06,830
Hey, can I have some tea?
I'm thirsty, man.

481
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:12,830
Been doing a lot of running lately.

482
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,670
Something I said?

483
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:25,430
What's up, man? That's how we do it.
There you go. That's where you let go.

484
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:29,560
Really?

485
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:35,020
Tell me, brother, who is the young man?

486
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:37,190
He's a thief.

487
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,490
You got one hell of a handshake.

488
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:44,740
Unfortunately, it's not strong enough.

489
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:53,130
A thief and you bring him here?

490
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,500
Water which is too pure has no fish.

491
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:58,550
Yes, I see.

492
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,890
My uncle told me what happened in
the Temple of Sublime Truth 60 years ago.

493
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,100
When you became the next
and protected him,

494
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,970
he was just a child.

495
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,810
But he never forgot what he saw that day.

496
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:12,890
The wonders of the scroll.

497
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,730
For 60 years, we have been preparing.

498
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:21,280
Now, the Year of the Ram
is once again upon us.

499
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:25,740
And we have a number of very apt pupils
right here in our humble temple.

500
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,910
And one very strong candidate.

501
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:32,290
Ah, not bad.

502
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,880
Yeah. I'm not even trying.

503
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,090
You thought you were gonna win,
but you're not.

504
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:46,090
– Oh, you think so?
– I know so.

505
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,140
It is not a matter of study alone.

506
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,600
There are the prophecies.

507
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,640
Surely you agree, brother,
the prophecies do not apply

508
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:57,360
to such a common thief, a pickpocket.

509
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:00,940
The prophecies must apply to everyone

510
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:03,900
or they mean nothing.

511
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:05,240
Of course.

512
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,580
– You let go first.
– No way.

513
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:21,170
Hey.

514
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:23,840
Just playing around.

515
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,720
Next time, brother.

516
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,390
Yeah, next time.

517
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:34,020
You helped me get away from those men.

518
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,850
Maybe there is some help I can give you

519
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,820
with your fighting.

520
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:41,940
Let's do it.

521
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:47,410
Here, here.

522
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,830
Special medicine.

523
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:55,410
Ah.

524
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:58,210
Hey, it's cool. It's comfy.

525
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,210
It's fast-acting. This stuff is great.
What is it?

526
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:04,760
Homemade. From my own urine.

527
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:12,680
That's disgusting.

528
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:15,140
– Excuse me?
– Yes?

529
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:17,310
I'm looking for someone. His name is Kar.

530
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:19,690
I asked around
and I heard that he works here.

531
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:22,610
What's a pretty girl like you
want to see him for?

532
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:26,240
– I think that he may be in trouble.
– Oh, damn right, he is in trouble.

533
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,900
Half the day has gone by

534
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:30,740
and he still hasn't got back
with tonight's movie.

535
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,950
So you're saying
that you haven't seen him all day?

536
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,370
Don't worry. Kar can take care of himself.

537
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,880
That's part of why I trust him to help me.

538
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,880
What's the other part?

539
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:46,090
I just don't know why, but I keep thinking

540
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:48,470
that kid's got potential.

541
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:52,100
So they tell me.

542
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:05,570
– Will you make sure that he gets this?
– What am I, a secretary?

543
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:06,860
Please.

544
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:13,070
You're welcome.

545
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:25,500
«Bad Girl»?

546
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:32,590
You must learn the unity of opposites.
Be mobile and stationary.

547
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:34,930
Defensive and offensive.

548
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:57,370
You attack
with all the wrong weapons, Kar.

549
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,550
It is not about anger. It's about peace.

550
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:27,150
It's not about power. It's about grace.

551
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,160
It's not about knowing your enemy.
It's all about knowing yourself.

552
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,400
– How'd you do that?
– The air.

553
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,320
You can't see it, but it fills your lungs.

554
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:19,700
It's as real as blood or flesh or bone

555
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,750
or earth, or water.

556
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:26,420
Once you realize this,
you treat the air the same way.

557
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,040
You step on it as you would a stone.

558
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,670
You swim through it as you would the sea.

559
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,720
And all you have to do is believe.

560
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,590
Believe what?

561
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,560
The laws of gravity don't exist?

562
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:46,350
If you truly believe that they don't,
then they don't.

563
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:55,900
Get down!

564
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,820
Hold the scroll. Don't lose it.

565
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:44,040
Right there!

566
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,130
Stay here.

567
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:17,320
<i>This is Air Team.
Target is on the roof.</i>

568
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:24,050
Oh, no.

569
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:57,170
Oh, shit!

570
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,780
<i>I'm hit. I'm pulling out.</i>

571
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:38,290
No!

572
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:55,310
Help!

573
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,190
Are you okay?

574
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:10,830
Look, I'm sorry about the scroll
and thanks for saving my life.

575
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:14,160
But I just came this close to being killed.

576
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:18,330
I'm a pickpocket, not a hero.
I'm out of here.

577
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,420
Hey!

578
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:25,130
Kar.

579
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:28,010
Don't you want to know the truth?

580
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:31,260
Well, it's about time you came clean.

581
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,770
– Right.
– That's right. Keep it going.

582
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,650
– Golden Palace theater.
– Very good.

583
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:45,570
– So, who are these guys after the scroll?
– Mercenaries led by a Nazi.

584
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:48,150
A hungry ghost obsessed with the past.

585
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,040
You speak like you were born
in the Punjab, my friend.

586
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,790
In fact, I would say you were a follower
of the Guru's path yourself but…

587
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,170
I know. Not enough hair.

588
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,000
You like this music?

589
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:04,460
– Yeah. – Yeah.
Subedit By: SharePirate.Com

590
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:06,340
It's the bomb-diggity.

591
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,550
Excuse me.
I have to talk to my baby mama-to-be.

592
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:10,890
Go ahead.

593
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:16,100
In Kashmir, I studied
the enlightened teachings of the Gurus

594
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:18,230
until Strucker found me again.

595
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:20,440
Strucker? He's the leader?

596
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,690
His dream is to remake the world
in his own image.

597
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:28,400
Every race, creed, color
he deems inferior, destroyed.

598
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,070
Total genocide.

599
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:33,240
If all this insanity is even remotely true,

600
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,410
you should've let me die
and saved the scroll.

601
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:37,500
I place great value on your life,

602
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:40,830
but not as much as I place
on the life of the world.

603
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:48,630
Well?

604
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:01,520
It's a recipe for noodle soup.

605
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:07,030
Noodle soup?

606
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:20,410
You may be my granddaughter,
but that will only protect you for so long.

607
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:26,880
– Then where's the scroll?
– On my body. In my soul.

608
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,590
I've been running for a long time.
Too many close calls.

609
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:32,970
The scroll needed to be someplace safe.

610
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:36,680
So you've been protecting
the scroll for, like, 60 years?

611
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:39,770
Look at you. You haven't aged one bit.

612
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:45,810
Whoever is entrusted with the scroll
gains the trust of time.

613
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:50,740
If you become ill, you will recover.
If injured, you will heal.

614
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:53,820
He who protects the scroll
is protected by it.

615
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,290
Hello there.

616
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:12,260
Sorry, but the show's been delayed.
Can I offer you popcorn? On the house.

617
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,590
No, thanks. Health Department.

618
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:19,260
Hey, hey, hey, I got an «A,» see?

619
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:22,520
You have a young man working for you.
He lives here.

620
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:26,230
You're aware that's a serious violation
of health and safety codes?

621
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:28,940
I don't know what you're talking about.

622
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:32,860
Does that jog your memory?

623
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:38,200
I'm calling the cops, you crazy bitch.

624
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:45,040
Oh, I'm not crazy, but I am a bitch.

625
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:49,380
Man, if I knew I was gonna pay,
I wouldn't have cabbed it.

626
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:53,050
Yo, Mr. Kojima.

627
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:57,050
Well, my boss doesn't seem to be here.

628
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:58,970
Which means you don't get
to watch me get yelled at.

629
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:06,520
«Bad Girl.»

630
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,330
Mr. Kojima!

631
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,430
Kar, over here.

632
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,620
I'm sorry, Kar.

633
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:13,960
I should have never gotten you involved.

634
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,050
– I just…
– You just what?

635
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:19,880
I had a crazy notion
that maybe you could fulfill a prophecy

636
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:23,140
once told to me by another old man
before he died.

637
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:30,900
They are never going to stop
until they get me and the scroll.

638
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:38,190
Go someplace safe
and forget about all of this.

639
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,780
Goodbye, Kar.

640
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,030
Time to fly.

641
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,170
Monk!

642
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,890
Monk!

643
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,320
Shit.

644
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:09,700
Open up!

645
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,330
Somebody!

646
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:18,840
– Excuse me.
– Go away.

647
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,710
Look, I'm sorry if I woke you,

648
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:24,090
but do you remember me from before?

649
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:26,470
I was with the monk.

650
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:27,890
Look…

651
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,180
Look, I have to find him.

652
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:32,930
– No, not here.
– No!

653
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:35,600
Stop.

654
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:40,110
He is a friend.

655
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:33,830
Hi.

656
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,790
Listen to me, man.

657
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:43,710
You can't do this alone.

658
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:48,510
I carry the responsibility
of the scroll on my shoulders,

659
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:50,850
no one else's.

660
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:55,560
If I have to carry it another 60 years, I will.

661
01:02:58,190 --> 01:03:01,810
I'll be safe here till the morning.
Then I'm leaving.

662
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,110
What about me?

663
01:03:04,190 --> 01:03:07,530
I'm sorry, Kar,
but this way is better for both of us.

664
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:09,570
No.

665
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:12,120
You can't abandon me like this.

666
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:15,450
Not after everything
you just put me through.

667
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:20,710
Because now I got nothing.

668
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:29,930
They're here.

669
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:50,400
– My brothers!
– You have to escape.

670
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:52,070
Escape to where?

671
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:57,500
– Where is he?
– Downstairs.

672
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:58,830
Stop! No!

673
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:09,470
– I'll kill him.
– Why?

674
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:11,260
I don't want to protect the scroll.

675
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:13,930
I want to read it, take the power.

676
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,180
Even if I have to share it.

677
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:28,690
Is this your idea of a joke?

678
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:44,460
Trust me. I'll get us out of the city.

679
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,630
My brother monks,

680
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:53,880
when I finally get my hands
on your brother with no name,

681
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:59,010
he will, of course, resist my efforts
to secure the location of the scroll.

682
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:01,770
But with this machine,

683
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:04,690
I'll torture
the information I need out of him.

684
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:09,020
And now for a little test.

685
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:11,900
What?

686
01:05:13,490 --> 01:05:15,910
No! Let me go. What are you doing?

687
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,740
We had a deal!

688
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:22,540
Did you really think I was going to share
ultimate power with you?

689
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:34,340
Engage hydro system.

690
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,640
Hydro systems engaged.

691
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:53,610
Too bad you have no
useful information for me.

692
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:02,790
Now, find me the monk.

693
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,500
Skipper's cool.

694
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,880
He's gonna take us
right where we want to go.

695
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:21,720
– You all right, man?
– Yeah.

696
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:28,560
You led me to the path
I should have chosen.

697
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,110
Thank you, Kar.

698
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:37,280
Isn't it customary to call a girl
before you show up at her house?

699
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:40,910
Yeah.
I figured it's in the middle of the night.

700
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,580
If I call her up, she might
say, «No way in hell.»

701
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:46,750
If I show up in person,

702
01:06:46,830 --> 01:06:49,670
she's not gonna say no
to my charming face.

703
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:53,300
You know what, man?

704
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:56,130
I'm not taking advice about women
from a monk.

705
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:02,970
I wasn't born a monk. Nobody is.

706
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:20,610
Hiding here for the night? Bad idea.

707
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:22,910
You must trust your instincts.

708
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:26,500
Where could we be safer
than in a house surrounded by guards?

709
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:29,460
So how we gonna get in, genius?

710
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,710
Why ask me? You are the thief.

711
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:38,630
Okay. The two principles of every rip-off

712
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,090
are misdirection and speed.

713
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:41,470
Misdirection.

714
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:55,900
And speed.

715
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
The coast is clear. Let's go.

716
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:24,090
All right.

717
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:36,360
How about a boost?

718
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:38,730
How about you do this one on your own?

719
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:42,360
Okay.

720
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:58,090
– You okay?
– Just checking the distance.

721
01:08:58,170 --> 01:08:59,800
– I know. Hurry up.
– It's good.

722
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:02,470
– Sure you don't want to do it?
– No, I'm fine.

723
01:09:03,090 --> 01:09:04,130
Okay.

724
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:08,680
You're good.

725
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:10,350
Check this out.

726
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:15,900
Oh, shit!

727
01:09:24,450 --> 01:09:26,200
Don't say anything.

728
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:29,660
You feel a little bit dizzy? Do you?

729
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:32,080
– I'm okay.
– Good.

730
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,460
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

731
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:36,710
– Very much. Do it.
– Yeah.

732
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:39,920
Okay, forget everything
you've ever learned

733
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,510
about how the universe operates.

734
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:45,510
I can step on the air like a stone,

735
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:48,100
swim through it like the sea.

736
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:50,760
All I gotta do is believe.

737
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,370
Not bad.

738
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:29,050
Well, well, well, what do we have here?

739
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:34,180
Lover of weird insects and deadly reptiles.

740
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:07,340
Hey, Bad Girl.

741
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,090
Oh, jeez!

742
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:15,060
Kar, what the hell are you doing here?

743
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:18,350
Lose this?

744
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,650
I didn't lose it. You stole it.

745
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:23,110
That's not true.

746
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:25,030
You're a liar.

747
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,110
Come on. You're a pickpocket.
You expect me to believe that?

748
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:32,780
I'm the nice guy. I wouldn't steal from you.

749
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,240
You can't lie for shit.

750
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:38,040
I'm a terrific liar.

751
01:11:39,790 --> 01:11:42,080
Okay. I did take it.

752
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:46,710
But I was just… I was borrowing it
so I could give it back.

753
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,130
Look, it was a stupid thing to do, okay?

754
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:52,010
– Sometimes I can be kind of…
– An asshole!

755
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:54,050
I may have lied to you about the necklace,

756
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:56,470
but I never lied to you about who I am.

757
01:11:57,350 --> 01:12:00,810
– You're saying that I did?
– Yeah. Look at this place.

758
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:02,690
I thought you were
from the streets like me,

759
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:05,400
but it turns out
you're some spoiled little rich girl.

760
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:08,400
– You don't know a damn thing about it.
– I think I do.

761
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:18,750
You kind of liked that, didn't you?

762
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:21,460
Is this what you want?

763
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:29,300
Why are you really here?

764
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:32,090
I came here
because I thought I could trust you.

765
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:34,590
That monk, he's got these mystical words

766
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,390
tattooed on his body

767
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,810
that some psycho from World War II needs

768
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:41,520
in order to take over
the whole goddamn world.

769
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:45,230
You're crazy!

770
01:12:48,070 --> 01:12:50,530
Kar? Kar, are you okay?

771
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:53,860
He'll be fine.

772
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:55,780
What are you doing here?

773
01:12:55,870 --> 01:12:57,870
That is not the question you need to ask.

774
01:12:57,950 --> 01:13:00,200
Instead, you should be asking yourself

775
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:03,750
why you run away
from this palace every night

776
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:06,290
then race back to it each morning.

777
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:08,250
With all due respect,

778
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:11,340
please don't tell me
how to live my life, okay?

779
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:13,970
I'm not telling you how to live your life.

780
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:18,720
I'm only suggesting you would be happier
living one complete life

781
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:21,350
instead of two lives that are incomplete.

782
01:13:24,230 --> 01:13:25,440
Kar.

783
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,280
Hey. You were right.
I think I should have called first.

784
01:13:32,530 --> 01:13:33,860
I'm sorry.

785
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:36,820
My life's complicated.

786
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:39,990
My dad's Ivan Kerensky.

787
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:42,160
What?

788
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:44,920
Ivan the Terrible?

789
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:53,720
You're a Russian mafia princess?
That's perfect.

790
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:55,680
My name is Jade.

791
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:58,930
And my dad is serving
20 years in federal prison.

792
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,010
So maybe now you understand

793
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:03,520
why I've been keeping
everything about myself secret.

794
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:08,020
Because the street is the one place
where I can earn my own respect.

795
01:14:15,530 --> 01:14:18,240
He will battle for love
in the Palace of Jade.

796
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:22,370
Two out of three.

797
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:25,410
Two out of three what?

798
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:29,920
Prophecies.

799
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,130
Look out!

800
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,450
Clever.

801
01:15:06,290 --> 01:15:09,420
Careful with that body of his. It's priceless.

802
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:28,140
They must have found your address
when they killed Kojima.

803
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:30,100
We need to get moving.

804
01:15:30,270 --> 01:15:31,770
Where the hell are we supposed to go?

805
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:34,270
The Human Rights Organization
downtown.

806
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:35,940
That's crazy.

807
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:38,570
That bitch who just wrecked my house,

808
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,280
she's the executive director there.

809
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:44,080
I was there this morning
for an exhibit opening.

810
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:48,910
My dad always told me
that the best place to hide

811
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,920
is the last place that they would expect.

812
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,830
And the Human Rights Organization

813
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:55,880
is the last place anyone
would ever expect to find

814
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:58,840
some of the biggest
human rights abusers in history.

815
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:05,140
Thanks. I gotta do this on my own.

816
01:16:05,970 --> 01:16:07,810
Monk's the only family I got.

817
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,270
I can help.

818
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:18,110
How do you like my armor-plated car, Kar?

819
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:21,570
We can use the subway
to reach the old water main,

820
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:24,950
which will get us into
the Human Rights building from below.

821
01:16:26,410 --> 01:16:29,910
Jeez! That's a nice collection of toys
your father keeps in the garage.

822
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:34,830
Who said these are my dad's?

823
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:41,220
My grandfather used to tell me
stories about you when I was a little girl.

824
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:42,380
I used to think you were a myth,

825
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:44,720
something he made up
to lull me to sleep at night.

826
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,510
And then one day,

827
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,140
he showed me these.

828
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:56,860
Ever wonder how he kept finding you
after all these years?

829
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:01,360
Oh, my name's Nina, by the way.

830
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:04,530
You don't have a name, do you?

831
01:17:05,530 --> 01:17:07,200
That's kind of sexy.

832
01:17:12,870 --> 01:17:15,540
How far down do these tattoos go,
I wonder?

833
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,050
That far.

834
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:25,720
Well, I guess I'll have to scan it all,

835
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,050
every inch. Oh, well.

836
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:32,980
Big job. Someone's got to do it.

837
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:51,580
You know, we might not make it
out of this thing alive.

838
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:54,040
Out of my car?

839
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,420
You got a lot of guts
for coming with me on this insane ride.

840
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:02,090
Guts and insanity.

841
01:18:03,090 --> 01:18:04,590
Interesting mix.

842
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,890
Not making it out of this thing alive

843
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:08,970
that would really suck

844
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:12,100
under the circumstances.

845
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:14,140
Yeah.

846
01:18:15,730 --> 01:18:17,100
Definitely.

847
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:38,960
Look at me, monk.

848
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:46,010
For you, the years were nothing,

849
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:50,430
but I withered and grew old.

850
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:57,230
But all that is about to change. Nina.

851
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,500
Find out what's going on, Nina.

852
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:25,340
Now!

853
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:21,140
Kaboom.

854
01:20:22,230 --> 01:20:23,860
You two, to the right.

855
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:33,620
Don't move!

856
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:36,330
Guys,

857
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:40,750
it's not about anger. It's about peace.

858
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:55,600
You do have potential.

859
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:05,610
The monk is down here. I can feel it.

860
01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:57,320
And now, the last verse.

861
01:22:09,340 --> 01:22:10,590
Where…

862
01:22:11,710 --> 01:22:13,670
Where is the rest of it?

863
01:22:18,850 --> 01:22:21,350
Where is the last verse of the scroll?

864
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:22,850
Where is it?

865
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:25,310
I memorized it.

866
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:30,980
Just in case someone like you
managed to get this far.

867
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:42,740
Fine.

868
01:23:01,970 --> 01:23:04,470
Oh, shit. We gotta move!

869
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:13,650
Get up!

870
01:23:15,150 --> 01:23:16,400
Come on!

871
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:17,950
Kar!

872
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,380
Hello, my dear.

873
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,600
Fancy meeting you here.

874
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:50,830
Now you will tell me what I want to know.

875
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:30,200
You know, this is getting very annoying.

876
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:36,140
– You okay?
– I'm okay.

877
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,770
Let's go back there and finish him off.

878
01:26:39,730 --> 01:26:41,610
I'll fight him myself.

879
01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:43,690
You're not ready.

880
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:47,240
Oh, really? I rescued you, didn't I?

881
01:27:02,590 --> 01:27:05,380
– Kar, stay back!
– No way.

882
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:20,310
Kar!

883
01:28:36,810 --> 01:28:38,020
Oh, my God.

884
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,390
The last verse

885
01:29:17,470 --> 01:29:19,180
or I destroy you.

886
01:29:19,390 --> 01:29:20,850
Destroy me,

887
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:23,980
and the scroll will be gone forever.

888
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:01,220
You may be willing to sacrifice yourself,

889
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,060
but are you willing to watch him die first?

890
01:30:10,110 --> 01:30:11,730
The last verse

891
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:14,650
or I drop him.

892
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:23,830
Kar, remember.

893
01:30:25,790 --> 01:30:27,420
You can beat him.

894
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:02,990
If I can't have it,

895
01:31:04,370 --> 01:31:07,670
I will take you and the scroll with me.

896
01:31:07,830 --> 01:31:11,500
For 60 years,
I have given you the chance to change.

897
01:31:11,710 --> 01:31:13,550
I will never change!

898
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:44,910
– Hey.
– Hey.

899
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:56,760
It's over?

900
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:58,090
Not yet.

901
01:32:03,510 --> 01:32:05,390
You are the next, Kar.

902
01:32:06,350 --> 01:32:09,440
When you rescued them
you fulfilled the third prophecy.

903
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:17,440
My time has ended. Yours has come.

904
01:33:19,090 --> 01:33:20,460
It is done.

905
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:28,510
Look out!

906
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:10,760
Jade?

907
01:34:22,070 --> 01:34:24,570
<i>He will defeat an army of enemies</i>

908
01:34:25,030 --> 01:34:27,610
<i>while a flock of cranes circles above.</i>

909
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:31,200
<i>Come on.
I'm bored with beating on this loser.</i>

910
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:36,000
<i>He will battle for love
in the Palace of Jade.</i>

911
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:41,800
<i>He will free the brothers he never knew</i>

912
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:43,550
<i>with the family he never had.</i>

913
01:34:43,590 --> 01:34:45,880
You both fulfilled the prophecies.

914
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:48,260
Not two lives that are incomplete,

915
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:50,430
one complete life.

916
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:18,040
I guess you're not the only one
that's bulletproof.

917
01:35:43,610 --> 01:35:44,610
Kar.

918
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,870
Your preparation is complete.

919
01:35:58,460 --> 01:36:00,920
Except for one last thing.

920
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:05,750
The final verse of the scroll.

921
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:16,470
And the second part.

922
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:26,440
Now you are inseparable.

923
01:36:27,690 --> 01:36:29,950
A unity of opposites.

924
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:33,030
Enjoy your vacation.

925
01:36:46,210 --> 01:36:47,630
What are you doing?

926
01:36:47,710 --> 01:36:50,130
Checking to see nothing is missing.

927
01:36:51,550 --> 01:36:55,550
I remember the first hug you gave me.

928
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:00,020
Hey.

929
01:37:02,270 --> 01:37:04,650
So, I figured it out.

930
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:07,730
Why hot dogs come in packages of ten

931
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:10,320
and hot dog buns
come in packages of eight.

932
01:37:12,110 --> 01:37:13,110
See, the thing is

933
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:16,120
that life doesn't always work out
according to plan.

934
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:18,700
So be happy with what you've got.

935
01:37:19,330 --> 01:37:20,910
Because you can always get a hot dog.

936
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,960
You got it.
