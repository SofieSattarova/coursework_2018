1
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:14,490
Benedict.

2
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:15,783
Is this true?

3
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,997
You have found the boy?

4
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,374
Yes.

5
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:26,711
He's not safe here.

6
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,880
Nonsense, this is a fortress.

7
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,631
The full resources of the Order...

8
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,258
...are at our disposal.

9
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:34,927
Respectfully...

10
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,723
...Benedict, the devil himself
wants this child.

11
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:41,267
Only one place is safe.
That is the Sanctuary.

12
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,852
The Rider must take him.

13
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,604
You do enjoy your wine, Moreau.

14
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:46,481
ln a few days...

15
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:50,026
...the winter solstice will be past
and with it the hour of the prophecy.

16
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:52,111
Then the boy will be
of no use to anyone.

17
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:53,821
By that time...

18
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,114
...brother...

19
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:56,908
...you will all be dead.

20
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,244
This conversation is finished.

21
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,096
They're inside!

22
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,505
Go!

23
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:56,759
Nadya!

24
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:00,680
l can help you!

25
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,349
Damn it. Danny!

26
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,726
l can protect you!

27
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,241
Where are they?

28
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:23,619
Shut up!

29
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:31,919
Perfect.

30
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:55,568
Who is this guy?

31
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,958
Screw this.

32
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:15,755
Duck!

33
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:43,532
lt doesn't matter how far you run.

34
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,203
There are some demons
you just can't escape.

35
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,121
My name is Johnny Blaze.

36
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,125
l rode a motorcycle for a living.

37
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,794
l did a bare-ass, 360...

38
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,672
...triple backflip
in front of 22,000 people.

39
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:02,093
lt's kind of funny.
lt's on YouTube. Check it out.

40
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,720
But when my dad got sick...

41
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,807
...l did something
way crazier than that.

42
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,564
You look like you could
use a little help.

43
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,525
Are you willing to make a deal...

44
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:19,694
...John?

45
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,071
Attaboy.

46
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:23,280
Do it.

47
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,198
Save his life.

48
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:25,783
Do it!

49
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:30,621
Yeah, that is right. l'm the guy
who made the deal with the devil.

50
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,123
I know what you're thinking.

51
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:36,752
Doesn't this kid watch movies?
Does this ever work out fine?

52
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,464
Let's just say good judgment
was not exactly my forte.

53
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:43,467
I was possessed by
an ancient demon.

54
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:47,513
ln the presence of evil,
l change into a monster...

55
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,014
...and I prey...

56
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,307
...on the wicked...

57
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,602
...and l suck out their souls.

58
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,938
And you don't wanna be around
when that happens.

59
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,816
See, there's good and bad in all of us.

60
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,693
And maybe you're not a murderer...

61
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:04,655
...but you did something
you wouldn't want the Rider to see.

62
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:08,033
A white lie, an illegal download.

63
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,871
What about you? And you?

64
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,958
l've tried to fight it, to hold it back...

65
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:20,796
...but the darkness inside me
only gets stronger.

66
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:22,965
That's why l had to run...

67
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,135
...halfway across the world.

68
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,222
And l'm still running.

69
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,206
Who are you?

70
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,416
My name is Moreau.
My brothers are dead...

71
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:02,087
...as should l be,
if not for the intervention of God.

72
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:06,926
And you are John Blaze.

73
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,386
Go away.

74
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,100
l can't do that.

75
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:32,701
lt likes...

76
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:33,786
...the dark places.

77
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,996
l don't know what you're talking about.

78
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,375
The Rider.

79
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,468
You thought that you could control it.

80
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,388
Make it work for you, huh?

81
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:54,265
That you were stronger...

82
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,142
...than this deep, hungry thing?

83
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,143
This...

84
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,311
...sickness.

85
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:01,814
Why are you here?

86
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:02,982
What do you...

87
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,650
...want from me?

88
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:08,571
l need your help
and you need your soul.

89
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,031
So we make a deal.

90
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,909
You know about making deals,
don't you, Johnny?

91
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,124
Nice bike.

92
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,297
This child.

93
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,217
He is in danger...

94
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,469
...and for more than his life.

95
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,638
You will save him.

96
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:40,394
l don't...

97
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:44,690
...save people.

98
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,779
What brought you out here,
Johnny Blaze?

99
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,449
Thousands of miles
from your place of birth...

100
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,493
...and your dark rebirth.

101
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,122
You were brought here for this.

102
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:06,462
This little kid,
what makes you think l can find him?

103
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,924
This man that you met years ago
that put the curse...

104
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,425
...on you?

105
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,260
Roarke.

106
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,429
The devil has many names.

107
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,724
He is the link that connects you
to this child.

108
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,686
Let the Rider follow his stench.
lt will lead you to the boy.

109
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,940
You said something about a deal.

110
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,234
The church of my masters
is an ancient one.

111
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,533
We are prepared to give to you the
one thing you want the most of this world.

112
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:43,082
Bring us the boy,
and we will lift your curse.

113
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:09,608
Hello.

114
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,193
Hi.

115
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:16,240
l noticed you were looking at me.

116
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,534
-Yes?
-Was l?

117
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,539
Nice suit.

118
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,457
Oh, thank you very much.

119
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,959
lt's....

120
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:33,215
Are you Roma?

121
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,842
Gypsy?

122
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,218
Why do you ask?

123
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,679
Well, what people say about....

124
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,180
What?

125
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,143
Listen...

126
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:48,063
...l am a businessman.

127
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,398
l have a lot of money.

128
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:50,941
Yeah?

129
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,693
-And....
-And?

130
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,320
Hey, Mommy. Where's Daddy?

131
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,742
-l.... Excuse me.
-No, no, no.

132
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,035
-lt's okay.
-No, really.

133
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,703
No, really, l.... Yeah.

134
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,496
Sorry.

135
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,930
Somebody's gonna have
a lot of explaining to do.

136
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,935
We won't always have to do this.

137
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,228
Okay?

138
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,525
l wanna make a life for you.

139
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,277
This is a life.

140
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,157
You know l love you more
than anything.

141
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,242
l love you too, Mama.

142
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:10,437
So many times I've tried to keep the Rider
from coming out, but tonight...

143
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,189
...l need him.

144
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,044
Hold on!

145
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:37,965
What happened?

146
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,467
Hold on.

147
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,358
Stay in and lock the doors.

148
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,949
Nadya.

149
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:48,911
No!

150
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,126
lt's been...

151
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,711
...a long time, pumpkin.

152
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:58,545
Carrigan.

153
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,757
l see you're still an unbelievable...

154
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:02,925
...pain in the ass.

155
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,470
Look, l got people after
Danny and me...

156
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,430
...so just let me go.

157
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,057
Let me go!

158
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,354
l'm the people after you.

159
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,023
No!

160
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,276
Don't touch him!

161
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:22,653
Get off!

162
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,576
Get up.

163
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,426
Unbelievable.

164
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,137
Still the fighter.

165
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,056
Carrigan.

166
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,770
-Yes?
-Please.

167
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,149
He's my son.

168
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,151
l know.

169
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,280
But he's not mine.

170
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,408
And part of you...

171
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,451
...had to know it might
end up like this.

172
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:20,479
Well, kill it.

173
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,354
Hungry.

174
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,689
Oh, God.

175
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,042
Slugthrowers, now.

176
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,898
Don't look at it.

177
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,569
No!

178
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,043
Get some.

179
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,256
Move, now!

180
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,426
Get him in the car.

181
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:57,594
Get in!

182
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,596
Danny!

183
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,085
-Oh, you have awake.
-Hi.

184
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:34,589
lt's funny,
because when you walked in...

185
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,591
...l thought l was still dreaming.

186
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,927
You have hallucinate?

187
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,221
No, no, man, l'm not hallucinating.

188
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,765
Look, l'm flirting with you.

189
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:44,808
You're beautiful.

190
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:48,979
Okay.

191
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,105
Morphine?

192
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,273
You got any morphine?

193
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,900
Oh, no, no, morphine,
you already have.

194
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,443
Dilaudid, Valium? What?

195
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:56,861
Your wounds....

196
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:58,405
Very weird...

197
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,698
...mister.

198
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:04,577
The poliţie want to talk to you
when you wake up. l tell them you wake.

199
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:05,412
No!

200
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:07,789
Please.

201
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,520
l'm fine. Let me go!

202
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:01,051
Take a piss.

203
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,693
Carrigan.

204
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:22,405
l got your package, but the cost
of doing business with me just went up.

205
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:23,823
l don't understand.

206
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,533
What's not to understand?

207
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:29,162
l want more. You understand that?

208
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,414
We had an agreement, Carrigan.

209
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:36,002
Changing the defined terms of an
agreement is something we just don't do.

210
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:39,297
You told me to get a kid.
Not a problem.

211
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,341
l've done that for people before.

212
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,052
And l have history
with his bitch of a mom...

213
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,555
...so there's no better guy for the job.
But what you didn't tell me...

214
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,934
...is that l'd be walking into the middle
of a goddamn horror movie.

215
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:53,853
Oh, this is funny...

216
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,063
...to you?

217
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,316
Three of my guys got turned
into matchsticks last night...

218
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:01,694
...by a dude on a motorcycle
with his head on fire.

219
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:06,908
Come again?

220
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,160
You heard me. I've seen things...

221
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,871
...weird things, bad things.

222
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,582
But that thing last night? No.

223
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,419
-No, no, no.
-Put the boy on the phone.

224
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,048
Talk.

225
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:25,260
Danny, do you hear me?

226
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,429
l want you to listen...

227
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,723
...very closely. Listen to me.

228
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,667
What the hell was that?

229
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:02,755
Think of the child as a sort of computer.
You know computers, right?

230
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:06,009
l just uploaded a little program.

231
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:08,720
A firewall.

232
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:13,391
Our friend on the motorcycle won't be
able to sense him now, to track him.

233
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:16,019
Of course, he still may be able...

234
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:19,189
...to find you,
so l suggest you keep moving.

235
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,443
Hello?

236
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:23,836
Who sent you to find me?

237
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:28,383
ls it the devil?
The devil that walks among men?

238
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:31,427
Does the devil own you? Answer me!

239
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:36,391
The kid, Danny. He's your son?

240
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,396
Bullets can't hurt you
when you walk with the demon.

241
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:43,648
But they'll do
what they're supposed to...

242
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,149
...right now.

243
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,403
Tell me why l can trust you.

244
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,697
You can't.

245
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,283
But if l don't find your son...

246
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:56,077
...l'd just as soon be dead.

247
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:58,204
So if you...

248
00:24:58,372 --> 00:24:59,038
...wanna pull...

249
00:24:59,206 --> 00:24:59,998
...that trigger...

250
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:03,918
...do it.

251
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,379
Please.

252
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,598
You tracked us last night.

253
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:20,184
Can you do it again?

254
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,188
l could feel him before.

255
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,317
l could sense him and then nothing.

256
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:33,615
No, no, he's not dead,
he's just blocked.

257
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,122
But you know something.

258
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,793
Let's go.

259
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:50,965
Yeah, okay, well, let me just
get something straight.

260
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:54,594
The guy who kidnapped Danny
and tried to kill you and blew me up...

261
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,096
...with grenades...

262
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,683
...you two were like
boyfriend, girlfriend?

263
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:06,397
Carrigan was a gunrunner,
a drug dealer, a mercenary.

264
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,067
l didn't care about that.
l just saw a ticket out.

265
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,152
Right, okay, and so Danny is...?

266
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,987
Danny, what, is Carrigan's son?

267
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:15,740
No.

268
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:19,911
When you met...

269
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,455
...the seducer,
he offered you something.

270
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:26,542
Yeah. My father's life.

271
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:28,795
Shocker, he lied.

272
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:31,464
For me, it was only myself.

273
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:36,052
lt was supposed to be big
for Carrigan, but it went bad.

274
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,554
l made it out a third-floor window.

275
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,432
I was choking on my own blood.

276
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,477
l knew l was gonna die.

277
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,063
l could feel it.
And that's when he found me.

278
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:50,983
You look like you could
use a little help.

279
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:55,154
Roarke.

280
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:57,907
He promised to take the pain away...

281
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,701
...to save my life.

282
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,330
But he asked for something in return.

283
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,583
A son?

284
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:11,129
-Maybe you can never understand.
-No, l get it.

285
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,631
You're the devil's baby mama.

286
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,426
l guess that explains why Moreau...

287
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:17,969
...wants...

288
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,346
...Danny so bad.

289
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:22,056
-Moreau?
-Yeah.

290
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:24,684
Black, French, alcoholic priest,
a dick. Know him?

291
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,104
He tried to help us. l didn't let him.

292
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,399
Well, we're both gonna work
on our decision-making.

293
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,860
Where you headed?

294
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,445
Someone l know.

295
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:39,407
He does Carrigan's dirty work.
He'll know where to find him.

296
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:49,000
Why does the devil walk on earth
in human form anyway?

297
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:50,710
l have no idea.

298
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:52,962
Maybe he doesn't know either.

299
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:53,880
Maybe he just...

300
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,883
...passes on from body to body...

301
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,302
...through history,
waiting for the perfect fit.

302
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:01,846
But I know one thing:

303
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:04,557
On Earth, he's weak.

304
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,559
His powers are limited.

305
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:09,061
He needs emissaries...

306
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,438
...to do his dirty work...

307
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:15,109
...so he finds them or makes them
using his greatest power:

308
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,986
The power of...

309
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,114
...the deal.

310
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,168
Can l open a window?

311
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,130
You think you can just talk?

312
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:41,719
Your mom thought she could just talk,
until l kicked her little Gypsy face in.

313
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:24,595
Grab him.

314
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,524
Get me-- Get me out of here!

315
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:39,068
l told you to stop eating the Twinkies.

316
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,362
-Get me out of here!
-Get off me.

317
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,615
Boss!

318
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,560
Come here.

319
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,437
Try that again, you little turd....

320
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:17,982
What?

321
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,234
Dude, what happened?

322
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:21,986
You speak English?

323
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,154
Yeah. What happened?

324
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,031
ls that your van?

325
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,244
-Yeah.
-Does it run?

326
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:31,829
Yeah.

327
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:06,781
When we get...

328
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:10,701
...where we're going,
the Rider's going to come out.

329
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,037
And when he does...

330
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:17,792
...he'll destroy whoever's got it coming.

331
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:22,088
Nadya, this thing...

332
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:26,926
...there's no reason, no conscience...

333
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:29,428
...just hunger.

334
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:32,098
ln his eyes...

335
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:37,061
...you're no different than Carrigan.

336
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,106
You're no different than any of them.

337
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,651
l'm not afraid of you.

338
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:46,654
Yeah? Well, you should be.

339
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,464
That's the guy?
He looks like he works...

340
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,924
...on a cruise ship.

341
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,136
Am l gonna regret taking you?

342
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,849
Yeah, probably.

343
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,397
Count every dollar!

344
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:23,274
l don't want these idiots robbing me.

345
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:24,442
Everyone's robbing me!

346
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,235
lt makes my balls hurt!

347
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:32,533
Hello, Vasil.

348
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:36,787
Long time, Nadya.

349
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:37,997
You look good.

350
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:40,583
Shut up.

351
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:42,960
He's talked to Carrigan.

352
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,963
The last couple of days
and a few hours ago.

353
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:47,923
John?

354
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,094
You talked to Carrigan?

355
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:55,056
l talk to a lot of people.
l got what you need for the shakes...

356
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,348
...my friend.

357
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:00,603
Carrigan must've told you...

358
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:03,731
...about that thing that killed
his men last night. Yeah?

359
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:04,690
That thing...

360
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,776
...is inside of me. See...

361
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:11,030
...you're a bad man and this thing,
the Rider, he feeds on bad men.

362
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:13,991
And he's hungry. He's hungrier
than he's been in years.

363
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,285
That's why l'm shaking!
Because right now...

364
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:19,455
...the only thing standing
between you and the Rider is me.

365
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,791
And he's just-- He's--

366
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,045
He's scraping at the door.
Scraping...

367
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:26,962
...at the door!

368
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:31,884
lf you don't tell me...

369
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:35,179
...what l wanna know,
l'm gonna let him out.

370
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:43,437
And when he's done with you, there won't
be anything left, do you understand?

371
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:47,108
Do you understand?
Shake your head yes or no. Good.

372
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,567
Good girl.

373
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,194
Where's Carrigan?

374
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,240
l want the kid! The kid Carrigan has!

375
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,533
You will tell me...

376
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,369
...or l will eat your stinking soul!

377
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:01,872
The quarry. For more guns, more men.
He's putting together...

378
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,208
-...a goddamn army.
-l know the place.

379
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:07,253
You won't mention this
conversation to anyone?

380
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,171
No, no, no.

381
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:11,507
Yeah. All right, well,
that was a good answer.

382
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,259
-Yeah, good.
-John.

383
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:18,389
We gotta go. We gotta go, we gotta go.

384
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:44,433
FGM-148 Javelin.

385
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:47,478
Lock on, fire and forget.

386
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:52,733
American bunker buster.

387
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:54,860
Two-stage detonation.

388
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,779
The first creates...

389
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:58,405
...a super vacuum.

390
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,574
lt sucks the oxygen from the air.

391
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,578
-The next--
-l know what it does.

392
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,956
Give me four of them,
with extra heads.

393
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,750
How many men you go up against?

394
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,002
Just one.

395
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:20,678
Danny?

396
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,972
-Mom?
-Are you okay?

397
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:27,643
l'm so sorry. l'm so sorry.
l'm gonna get you out of here.

398
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:34,149
-What?
-l think my ankle's broken.

399
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,068
Come on, hold on.

400
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:56,922
Oh, no.

401
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,514
Come on, hold onto me.

402
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,559
Showtime.

403
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:10,644
Hey!

404
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,485
What is it?

405
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,362
l don't care.

406
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:21,905
Give me that thing.

407
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,615
-Give it to me.
-Now.

408
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,556
Shit!

409
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:51,560
That was awesome.

410
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,115
Reload. Just reload.

411
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,794
Give me that.

412
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,214
Okay.

413
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,197
l'm sorry, did that hurt?

414
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:28,532
lt looked like...

415
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,700
...it did.

416
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,198
Come on.

417
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:52,449
Let's go.

418
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:12,970
Hurry!

419
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:31,071
Sorry. Does it hurt?

420
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,740
lt looks like it does.

421
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,702
What are you waiting for? Do it! Do it!

422
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:51,925
He's coming.

423
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:17,909
Let me go.

424
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,921
Enough.

425
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:34,301
Let her go.

426
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,598
So that happened.

427
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,419
There you go.

428
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:02,222
lt was a bee. l thought it was
gonna sting your face.

429
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:06,393
Well, are you feeling better?

430
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:10,772
Your leg's all healed, huh?

431
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,900
Like all by itself.

432
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:16,027
That's weird.

433
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,281
Where's my mom?

434
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,700
She's gassing up the truck.

435
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,873
l know that it's a little awkward.

436
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:31,793
Me rolling with you guys.
l mean, after everything that you've...

437
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:33,462
-...been through.
-Dude.

438
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:36,214
You're cooler than the guys
she usually hangs out with.

439
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,344
Hey.

440
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,403
So, what's next?

441
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:02,032
Moreau thinks that the danger
will pass in a few days.

442
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,034
lf we just get Danny someplace safe...

443
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:06,286
...a holy place,
where his people can protect us...

444
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:07,871
...then we can ride it out.

445
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,248
Okay.

446
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:14,085
l've already contacted Moreau.
He's gonna catch up with us on the road.

447
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:22,093
We gotta move fast because the ones
who are hunting us, they're not done.

448
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:28,141
Plus, l have some personal issues
l'd kind of like to get fixed.

449
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,613
You're not done, Carrigan.

450
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:45,200
You were to bring me Nadya's son.

451
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,620
l do expect you to fulfill your obligation.

452
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:56,419
S.... S.... S.... Sorry, jackass...

453
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,299
...but l'm dead.

454
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,222
lnconvenient.

455
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:57,647
What'd you do to me?

456
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:01,651
Gave you a second chance.

457
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:05,780
You're a little less than alive now.

458
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,118
But also more.

459
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:16,249
You see, l've given you power.

460
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:19,377
The power of...

461
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,504
...decay.

462
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:25,842
Of darkness.

463
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:04,297
l want that boy, Carrigan.

464
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:07,342
Now you've got no...

465
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:09,094
...excuses.

466
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,724
The machine last night?

467
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,184
Yeah?

468
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:18,019
You made it change.

469
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:19,479
That's how it works.

470
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:22,565
Whatever he rides changes with him.

471
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,694
And what if he took a taxi?

472
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:29,823
l don't know. l don't know. Why?

473
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:32,367
Or a roller coaster or a ski lift
or a camel or a--

474
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:34,160
Dude.

475
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:37,914
What if you have to pee
while you're on fire?

476
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:42,836
Oh, it's awesome. lt's like a flamethrower,
you know? lt's like:

477
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:08,778
When you change, when you're him...

478
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:11,614
...does it feel good?

479
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:15,827
Sometimes.

480
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:19,622
What does it mean? Are we just bad?

481
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:22,333
No.

482
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:28,423
This power that we have
comes from a dark place...

483
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:30,884
...but it's not who we are.

484
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,510
lt never will be.

485
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:36,014
And we can use it to do good...

486
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:37,724
...to help people.

487
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:42,062
Like l'm helping you and your mom.

488
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:44,272
l know why you're helping.

489
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:47,692
She says you wanna get rid of it.

490
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,237
l can't ever do that.

491
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:04,667
Hey, Nadya. l hope you have
finished shooting at me!

492
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:11,174
Hey.

493
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:13,676
You wanna have some fun?

494
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:31,611
Hang on.

495
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:29,169
That is so weird.

496
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:24,015
So this is it, Moreau's happy place.

497
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,768
These guys will lift my curse?

498
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,896
They don't even have shoes.

499
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:49,123
Amen.

500
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:00,134
You mustn't be afraid.

501
00:53:01,262 --> 00:53:03,012
lt was God that led you here.

502
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:09,519
What's up?

503
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:15,817
l know. A little...

504
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:17,277
...uptight. Not so bad...

505
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,404
...once you get to know them.

506
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:20,238
Now go on.

507
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:22,699
They will take...

508
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,575
-...good care of you.
-What about...

509
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:25,576
...you two?

510
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:30,456
We will join you later. we have some
business to complete between us.

511
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:32,166
l made a promise to you, John.

512
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:38,715
Why can't he come with us?

513
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,341
-No!
-Danny.

514
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:42,343
Danny...

515
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:44,178
...you're safe here.

516
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:46,014
We made it.

517
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:51,144
The only thing that can hurt
you and your mom now...

518
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:53,021


519
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:55,857
l need to make sure
that will never happen.

520
00:53:57,318 --> 00:53:58,985
lt'll be all right.

521
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:01,362
l promise.

522
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:03,364
Whatever.

523
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:04,699
Come on.

524
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,371
Are you sure about this?

525
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:14,250
Come on.

526
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:19,422
-Where are we going?
-To my favorite room.

527
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:23,509
lf there is one thing
these sons of bitches know...

528
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,345
...it's wine.

529
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:33,144
This bottle would fetch
50,000 euros at an auction.

530
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:36,022
Moreau.

531
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,231
Oh, yeah.

532
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:39,859
-What is it?
-lt's--

533
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:43,988
This thing inside of me.
l'd like to know before we...

534
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:46,449
...commence.

535
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:53,539
Zarathos was an angel...

536
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,751
...a Spirit of Justice.

537
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:04,092
Sent to protect the world of men.

538
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:07,053
But he was tricked...

539
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:09,806
...captured...

540
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:13,393
...brought down to hell...

541
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:15,353
...corrupted.

542
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:22,110
Driven insane.

543
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:30,326
His mission to protect the innocent
was perverted...

544
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:32,537
...into a lust to punish...

545
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:33,788
...the guilty.

546
00:55:33,956 --> 00:55:35,415
He became...

547
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,960
...the Spirit of Vengeance.

548
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:43,464
Yeah, but the angel,
the Spirit of Justice...

549
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:45,133
...he's alive in there?

550
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:47,718
Somewhere?

551
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:49,679
He could be.

552
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:53,850
Do you feel him?

553
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:01,274
No.

554
00:56:04,153 --> 00:56:07,864
Cheer up, my man.
Soon you will be free.

555
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:10,700
This bottle....

556
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:17,039
This one is over 2000 years old.

557
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:20,126
l've had my eye on it for a while.

558
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:25,923
When this is over...

559
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,887
...we will share it, huh?

560
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:35,975
There's something else.

561
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:41,731
This thing that Roarke has done to you
is not easily undone.

562
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,109
You risk death.

563
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:48,279
Worse than death.

564
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:54,202
You must confess...

565
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:59,790
...the one thing that is most difficult
for you to talk about.

566
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,266
My dad.

567
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,645
l didn't do it for him.

568
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,607
l made the deal for me.

569
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:29,278
l couldn't let him go.

570
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:32,823
lt was selfish.

571
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:37,203
He was ready to die.

572
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:40,206
He knew it was his time.

573
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,042
And l thought l could change that.

574
00:57:45,254 --> 00:57:46,671
l'm sorry.

575
00:57:56,723 --> 00:58:00,518
This is the lamb of God...

576
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:04,772
...that takes away all the sin
from the world.

577
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:09,819
Happy are those
that are called to receive him.

578
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:14,615
You say that you're not worthy
to receive him.

579
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:15,908
l'm not.

580
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:18,327
Okay, that's good enough.

581
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:22,373
The body of Christ.

582
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:25,793
Amen.

583
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:34,218
You've been carrying this bread
around for a while.

584
00:58:37,598 --> 00:58:42,852
May God lead you
into the eternal life.

585
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:48,232
That is, John, if today is,
in fact, your last.

586
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:54,196
Where you go now, l cannot follow.

587
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:56,324
Are you ready?

588
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:09,253
Hello?

589
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:11,797
Hey.

590
00:59:25,354 --> 00:59:27,021
Merry Christmas, you assholes!

591
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:33,361
Make the deal.

592
01:00:19,408 --> 01:00:28,666
Moreau!

593
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:31,210
You did it!

594
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:39,427
Moreau!

595
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:42,638
lt worked.

596
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:44,932
No! Let me go!

597
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,225
Help me!

598
01:00:47,436 --> 01:00:49,395
-Hey! What are you doing?
-Get off me!

599
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:52,064
Let me go!

600
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,109
What are you doing?

601
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:58,362
What will be done.

602
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,909
The day of prophecy is tomorrow.

603
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:07,413
We were to hold the boy
until the danger passes.

604
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:10,082
The danger will not pass, Moreau.

605
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,917
As long as the boy exists...

606
01:01:12,961 --> 01:01:13,752
...the power...

607
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,005
...will always be inside him.

608
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,760
You lied to me.

609
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,471
You lied to me!

610
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:26,765
This child must be destroyed.

611
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:29,977
No!

612
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:34,356
You might have protested
while the child was being conceived.

613
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:38,068
Now it is too late.

614
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:47,912
Take them away...

615
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,622
...until the thing is done!

616
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:53,375
Go!

617
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:57,171
Danny's soul can still be saved!

618
01:01:57,339 --> 01:02:00,090
That boy is one of God's children!

619
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:01,926
No!

620
01:02:03,512 --> 01:02:05,262
He is not.

621
01:03:15,584 --> 01:03:16,792
Pretty neat, huh?

622
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,226
Peace, brother.

623
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,286
Damn.

624
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:55,914
Bet you're happy to see me.

625
01:04:23,318 --> 01:04:24,568
Did Danny do this?

626
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:27,988
No. Somebody got here
before they could--

627
01:04:28,156 --> 01:04:29,907
Before they could kill him.

628
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:31,950
There's no sign of him.

629
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,410
Whoever did this wanted...

630
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:35,079
-...him alive.
-l think we all...

631
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:37,998
...have a pretty good idea
who that would be, Moreau.

632
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:39,333
Yeah. So now he's...

633
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:41,960
...with Roarke.
Some protectors you turned out to be.

634
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:44,630
What exactly does Roarke
have in mind for Danny?

635
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:48,592
What are his plans for his son? ls he
putting money away for college? What?

636
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:50,469
lt is the day...

637
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:51,970
...of prophecy.

638
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:54,890
As was the day Danny was conceived.

639
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,393
The child must be in his 1 3th year...

640
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,229
...before the rite can be performed
on the dawn of winter.

641
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:01,730
The rite.

642
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:07,653
Roarke fathered the boy as a vessel,
as a container for his power.

643
01:05:07,821 --> 01:05:10,739
The ritual will transform his essence...

644
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:13,242
...his soul into the boy.

645
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,577
There will be no more Danny.

646
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:17,913
-Only Roarke.
-No!

647
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:20,290
-Why the hell didn't you tell us this?
-Hey.

648
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,418
You made a deal with Roarke!

649
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:26,046
Both of you!
Something l would never do.

650
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:28,924
The prophecy had to happen
at the dawn of a new day.

651
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:30,426
Maybe there's still time.

652
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:32,886
-Do you know where Roarke has him?
-l think so.

653
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:34,888
What, so now you want to play hero?

654
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:37,349
You got what you wanted.

655
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:39,810
Yes, l did.

656
01:05:40,228 --> 01:05:42,521
Thank you for holding up
your end of the bargain.

657
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:44,231
You're welcome.

658
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:45,858
lf l can spend my last day...

659
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:47,943
...as a free man without a curse...

660
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:49,486
...over my head, l'll take it.

661
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:52,239
But l promised Danny he'd be safe.

662
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:54,783
And if l walk away now...

663
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:57,369
...l'm just trading
one demon for another.

664
01:05:58,204 --> 01:05:59,413
So let's go.

665
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:30,360
-Was there ever any doubt?
-Don't...

666
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:31,945
...touch me.

667
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:34,865
Cutting it a bit close, aren't we?

668
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,162
You have any idea...

669
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:43,207
...what l had to go through...

670
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:45,876
...to get this little turd?

671
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:49,671
Look...

672
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:53,300
...the planets don't align for your
pagan party until daybreak tomorrow.

673
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:57,095
So get off my ass
because l'd say l'm ahead of schedule.

674
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:01,391
Danny.

675
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:06,855
Do you know who l am?

676
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:11,276
Well, l'm sure your mother told you...

677
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,403
...a lot of things about me.

678
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:15,781
What's the matter with your face?

679
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:26,208
Uzak Gökten.
The farthest point from heaven.

680
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:31,463
That is where the ritual is to take place,
according to the prophecy, of course.

681
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:33,590
Of course.

682
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:37,553
Without the Rider, we stand
very little chance against Roarke.

683
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,346
You were supposed to have faith.

684
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:40,848
l do.

685
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:44,893
But also,
l think we should have weapons.

686
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:48,564
Guns...

687
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,065
...and wine.

688
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,818
Naughty priests.

689
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:56,446
l'm starting to like you again, Moreau.

690
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:03,579
You wanted to know
why l look this way.

691
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:08,709
Think of...

692
01:08:09,377 --> 01:08:10,752
...a flamethrower.

693
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,637
ls that funny?

694
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:24,808
Okay.

695
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:28,729
A flamethrower
made out of papier-mâché.

696
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,190
All that...

697
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:33,901
...power.

698
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:37,404
But try to use it, you burn up.

699
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:40,699
This body l'm living in...

700
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:44,494
...it's weak, human.

701
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:47,331
lt's dying.

702
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:51,585
lt was never made to do
the things that l can do.

703
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:53,295
But you...

704
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:57,549
...you're only part human.

705
01:08:57,717 --> 01:09:01,470
You have all the power
that l have inside of you.

706
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:04,723
Like father, like son.

707
01:09:04,891 --> 01:09:06,058
But this...

708
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:07,100
...corporeal...

709
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:08,727
...form...

710
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:12,940
...can wield the power
without burning itself up.

711
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:22,866
To help you...

712
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:23,700
...relax.

713
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:37,422
That will keep him sedated
until the ceremony.

714
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:54,189
Who are they?

715
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:57,901
Politicians, murderers,
people of influence.

716
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,904
The devil's soldiers.

717
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:03,407
They've traveled
from all over the world...

718
01:10:03,574 --> 01:10:06,284
...to witness the anointing
of the new king.

719
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,036
The new king.

720
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,664
Please.

721
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:12,582
lf Roarke succeeds...

722
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:16,378
...he'll have a new form,
one more powerful than he's ever known.

723
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:20,716
And a shadow will fall upon the earth.

724
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:08,346
Twenty-five...

725
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:10,849
...30 men. More inside.

726
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:12,642
The ritual has already begun.

727
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:15,187
Danny's soul will be lost forever...

728
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:19,066
...at the break of dawn.
This is when Roarke is at his weakest.

729
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:24,446
Nadya?

730
01:11:33,915 --> 01:11:35,582
You all right?

731
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:46,176
l've made a lot of mistakes, Blaze.

732
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:47,844
But Danny....

733
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:54,810
Danny's the one....

734
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:58,063
The one good thing...

735
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,109
...l ever did.

736
01:12:03,111 --> 01:12:06,947
Well, that being the case...

737
01:12:07,115 --> 01:12:11,159
...we had better make sure he doesn't
turn out to be the Antichrist.

738
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:01,918
Okay. Not much time.

739
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:03,211
What's the plan?

740
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:06,214
Plan is you go, you grab the boy,
you run and you don't stop.

741
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:08,049
What about you?

742
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:12,888
Me? l'm going through the front.

743
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:16,016
Okay.

744
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:21,980
Not bad.

745
01:13:26,027 --> 01:13:29,154
This might be good on a salad.

746
01:13:30,448 --> 01:13:31,198
Johnny Blaze!

747
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:38,079
Go.

748
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:51,593
Catch this one, huh?

749
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:56,681
What a waste of good wine!

750
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:10,338
That felt good.

751
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:19,931
Come on.

752
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:37,282
Danny, listen to me.

753
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:39,367
l shouldn't have gotten rid
of the power.

754
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,077
l know that now.

755
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:42,620
He's gonna erase you, Danny.

756
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:04,768
Moreau.

757
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:11,858
l can still see the light!

758
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:26,623
That's gross.

759
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:29,584
You have no power, Blaze.

760
01:16:30,378 --> 01:16:32,087
You're nothing but an insect...

761
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:34,339
...like the rest.

762
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:35,840
Food for the mills...

763
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:37,342
...of hell.

764
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:50,855
No.

765
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:52,357
Not yet.

766
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:13,169
Oh, you wanna watch?

767
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:21,719
The apple doesn't rot far from the tree!

768
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:26,015
Danny.

769
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:32,439
This is not who you are.

770
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:35,525
lt never...

771
01:17:35,693 --> 01:17:37,068
...will be.

772
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:44,951
My powers and yours are the same.
That's what you said.

773
01:17:46,454 --> 01:17:47,620
Right?

774
01:17:48,247 --> 01:17:49,789
Dad?

775
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:52,917
Like father, like son.

776
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:14,898
Do it.

777
01:18:21,489 --> 01:18:23,364
No!

778
01:21:48,862 --> 01:21:49,696
Come here.

779
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:37,952
Enough!

780
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:08,065
l was never afraid of you.

781
01:23:30,923 --> 01:23:32,256
Roadkill.

782
01:24:53,046 --> 01:24:54,714
You!

783
01:24:56,008 --> 01:25:00,386
Worst fucking deal l ever made.

784
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:10,354
Go home.

785
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:54,690
Danny!

786
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:19,108
The angel.

787
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:21,610
Moreau...

788
01:27:21,778 --> 01:27:26,115
...said that the Rider
was an angel that went crazy.

789
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:29,577
l can feel him...

790
01:27:30,537 --> 01:27:32,121
...the angel.

791
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:37,334
l can feel him.

792
01:27:51,433 --> 01:27:55,102
Danny?

793
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:00,941
Did we win?

794
01:28:04,905 --> 01:28:06,530
l'm gonna say yes.

795
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:11,118
Hell, yes.

796
01:28:13,747 --> 01:28:16,499
My name is Johnny Blaze.

797
01:28:18,835 --> 01:28:20,419
l'm the Ghost Rider.
