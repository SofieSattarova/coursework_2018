1
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:33,491
First and 10 on the New York 32.
Malone hands off for a one-yard gain.

2
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:36,286
Can't establish their running game
because Washington...

3
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:39,206
- God will help you.
- God owes me a quarter pound.

4
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:42,167
Mince and mash
the garlic into a paste.

5
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:45,295
- I seek...
- Go, Buster, go!

6
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,380
...Reputed crime boss
Gaitano Cesare...

7
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,634
...once again avoided prison
when a mistrial was declared today...

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,011
...in his eight-week long
RICO prosecution.

9
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,889
Allegedly responsible
for over 200 murders...

10
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,850
...Cesare has yet to spend one day
behind bars.

11
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,769
Mr. Eugene Gordlock...

12
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:04,356
...a witness who repeatedly asked the
judge to be recused from the case...

13
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,983
...was gunned down
just a few hours earlier.

14
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,904
We had the opportunity to speak
with Mr. Gordlock's mother.

15
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,290
They shot him right in our front yard.

16
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:48,251
My dear, sweet little boy.

17
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,170
The pained words
of a grieving woman...

18
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:54,132
...left all alone in a city outraged
by these developments.

19
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,384
But with no concrete evidence
of tampering...

20
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,303
...and with Mr. Gordlock now dead...

21
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,682
Do I fix your makeup for you?

22
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,687
- What?
- Here's Billy the Beaut.

23
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,194
The captain should have sent
me out here with 30, 40 men...

24
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,446
...to raze this bloody
get-out-of-jail party.

25
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,156
Instead, I'm stuck here with you.

26
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,450
Well, he might come out tonight.

27
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,161
As a matter of fact,
I'm sure he'll show up.

28
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,122
And what are you gonna do?

29
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,999
I'm gonna bring him in.

30
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:15,296
You know, you kill me, Soap. Let's just
say if you can make this happen...

31
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,590
...why would you?

32
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:21,302
He does to those bastards what
me and you can only fantasize about.

33
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,389
Ink, keep your nose clean.

34
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,015
Yeah.

35
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,518
Sure thing, Pops.

36
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,900
Hey.

37
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,070
Look, you know, it's just...

38
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:43,575
- Take it easy in there, okay?
- Nicky, what am I gonna do?

39
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,410
Give the old guy a heart attack?

40
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,503
- Go on, beat it.
- Give me uno minuto.

41
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:02,719
You handled
the witness situation perfectly.

42
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,722
No sweat, Uncle G.

43
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,102
- You look great.
- The hell I do.

44
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,062
I shit in a bag, for chrissake.

45
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,024
Hey, saves you a trip to the can, right?

46
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:19,569
You came to discuss a private matter.

47
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,070
Down at the docks!

48
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,780
Right. Yeah. Cristu Bulat.

49
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,867
I hear he's a sick fuck.
Fresh off the boat.

50
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:29,245
Cristu's bringing in a shipment
and he needs a safe port.

51
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,415
I've arranged for my customs guy
Simmons to be on that night.

52
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,335
The union boys'll be there to unload.
Our cut's 10 mil.

53
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,463
- We won't break a sweat.
- Ten mil?

54
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:42,175
- Fuck's Cristu shipping?
- I don't know.

55
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,886
It's some kind of biological package.

56
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,888
A biological package.

57
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,432
I fucking knew it.

58
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,143
Probably going up to the ragheads
in Queens.

59
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,439
- Cristu guaranteed it's leaving the city.
- We don't touch that kind of shit.

60
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,275
In case your memory's going
with your bodily functions...

61
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,778
...you might remember
I'm the top earner here.

62
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:04,447
- I'm not stupid.
- Stupid?

63
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:10,161
You're as shithouse crazy
as your brother, Loony Bin Jim.

64
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,248
I should have had the both of you
locked away.

65
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,959
One more word about my brother,
I swear to Christ I'll...

66
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,420
You'll what?
You make one move, you greasy fuck.

67
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,965
Hey, let's just all calm down here,
okay?

68
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,804
I've put out a big spread out here.

69
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:31,182
So come on, boys, eat up.

70
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,982
We're not eating with the old shitbag,
understand?

71
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,818
Pittsy, pour me a drink.

72
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:27,780
What the fuck?

73
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:33,995
Pittsy!

74
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,086
Let's go.

75
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,455
All right, let's split up.

76
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,124
Shouldn't we wait for backup?

77
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,431
Police! Freeze!

78
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,067
Listen, Billy Russoti's getting away.

79
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,736
Silver Rover.

80
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,196
You might wanna head down
to the docks first.

81
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,459
Shit, that hurts.

82
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,839
- What happened to you?
- Your Punisher.

83
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:53,384
He disarmed me, held me at gunpoint
then he stole our damn ride.

84
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,845
- Where were you, huh?
- I knew he would come.

85
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,556
Hey, let me get your statement.

86
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,350
Come on, Saffiotti, tell me everything...

87
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,394
How did it go down, huh?

88
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:30,064
I'm sorry about your family, Billy.

89
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,901
Well, maybe it's a
blessing in disguise.

90
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,111
What?

91
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,321
It was time for me to
take over anyway.

92
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:41,158
Thanks to The Punisher, I don't
even get my fucking hands dirty.

93
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,037
Where's your boss, then?

94
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:49,500
- What the fuck's he doing here?
- Relax. I asked him to come.

95
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,545
My man. How are you doing?

96
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:56,465
- Who the fuck are these finooks?
- These are couple of my colleagues.

97
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,427
They are very,
very gifted delivery men.

98
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:03,931
No mountain too high,
no river too deep.

99
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,476
All right, all right, all right, enough.

100
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,313
- Pittsy, get me some money.
- Time to go to work.

101
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,689
We're running low, boss.

102
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,483
We picked up 200K
from the Lucciano construction site.

103
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,861
I had to launder it through
the Pussycat Lounge.

104
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:20,781
- Like you told me, remember?
- Well, bring it back tomorrow.

105
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,825
- You got it, boss.
- Here.

106
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:26,203
That's 20 rolls of hundreds,
that's a grand each. All counted.

107
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,039
Head for the port, do your thing...

108
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,666
...get over the security fence,
hand out the money.

109
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,337
Where are you going?

110
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,507
Would it be all right
if I take the roof instead of the door?

111
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,469
- Whatever.
- You're a fucking saint.

112
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,876
Hey, what's the matter?

113
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,248
Oh, fuck.

114
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,874
What the fuck was that?

115
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,043
Agent down. Repeat, agent down.
Fuck.

116
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,170
I'll check it out, boss.

117
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,892
Pops!

118
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,478
No. I'll take care of it.
You get the guards.

119
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:16,981
Pittsy!

120
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:33,622
Fuck, you bastard. Fuck.
Fuck you, Castle!

121
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,792
Come on, Castle!

122
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,466
Fuck you, man!
Fuck you, Castle, you fucking...

123
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,804
Fuck you, Castle! Fuck!
My fucking face!

124
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,974
Pittsy! Pittsy! Pittsy!

125
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,977
Fuck, my fucking face!

126
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:59,607
Fuck! Pittsy! Pittsy! Pittsy!

127
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,650
There he is!

128
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,822
Move! Move! Move!

129
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,657
Up there!

130
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,493
Move!

131
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,416
Up there!

132
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,173
Fuck!

133
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,677
Up there!

134
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,870
- FBI. Drop your weapons.
- Oh, shit. Shit.

135
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,581
You two, up the stairs.
Team 1, on me.

136
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,166
Don't move!

137
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,044
FBI! Put your weapons down.

138
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,705
We got a live one!

139
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,166
Take care of those
five yards in every direction.

140
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,834
Billy the Beaut.

141
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,003
Yo, you say Billy the Beaut?

142
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,215
- Not anymore, huh?
- Bring him down, maybe he'll live.

143
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:16,679
- Wait a minute.
- Repeat, Nicholas Donatelli Jr.

144
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,684
Reach Donatelli's family.
Can you ask Miller if...

145
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,312
The Lord is compassion and love.

146
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:29,066
Slow to anger and rich in mercy.

147
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,194
He does not treat us
according to our sins...

148
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,364
...nor repay us according to our faults.

149
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,242
As parents have compassion
on their children...

150
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,578
...the Lord has pity on those
who fear him.

151
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:46,333
For he knows of what we are made,
he remembers that we are dust.

152
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,546
As for us, our days are like grass.

153
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,215
We flower like the flower of the field.

154
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,968
The wind blows and we are gone.

155
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,388
And our place never sees us again.

156
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,524
I'm so sorry for your loss.

157
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,067
Thank you.

158
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,497
Who compromised Donatelli?

159
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,875
Calm down, Budiansky,
it wasn't anybody's fault.

160
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,501
None of us could foresee Castle...

161
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,628
...opening up hunting season
on La Cosa Nostra.

162
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:32,838
Come on.

163
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,549
All right, look,
Donatelli sent us a message.

164
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,551
Said something big
was gonna happen.

165
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,178
He asked for Homeland Security.

166
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:42,348
We ran 24-hour surveillance on
Russoti. Just as we're about to...

167
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,767
...find out what is happening,
Donatelli got shot.

168
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,227
Believe me,
no one is more pissed off than I am.

169
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,396
How is it we're not all over
Frank Castle?

170
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:52,024
Because we have
a real national security threat.

171
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:56,612
And the last time I checked, that tops
trying to nab some crazed vigilante.

172
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,113
Go.

173
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:05,120
- Hey.
- Hey.

174
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,040
I'm gonna get this guy, Angie.

175
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,125
I promise you.

176
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,892
I heard the bureau
was sending a babysitter.

177
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,393
Liaison.

178
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,730
Thirty years on the force, I still
don't know what that word means.

179
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,692
We have a certain way of doing things
here, Special Agent Budiansky.

180
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,028
Like letting mass murderers run free?

181
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:05,240
Four years
this Punisher's been wreaking havoc.

182
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,534
And you haven't once caught a break.

183
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:11,663
I'm waist deep in shit around here
as you can plainly see.

184
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,041
Your buddies from
the bureau told me...

185
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,585
...the city is under
some kind of terror threat.

186
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:20,214
New Yorkers are a bit sensitive
about that, if you know what I mean.

187
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,132
I've got my men trying to find out...

188
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,801
...what your colleague came across
when he went under.

189
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,095
Maybe if you feds allowed us...

190
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:30,098
...in on your undercover operations
once in a while...

191
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:34,478
- ...all of this could have been avoided.
- With all due respect, captain...

192
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:36,104
...that...

193
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,481
...is bullshit.

194
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,692
What if it had been your man
lying there?

195
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,070
In a pool of his own blood?

196
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,781
You Krispy Kreme motherfuckers...

197
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:48,742
...would be beating down
every door in this city.

198
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,244
Captain.

199
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,246
Captain, you know what?

200
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:56,917
The Punisher Task Force
could use an extra man.

201
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,841
Room 12.

202
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,843
The basement.

203
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:29,449
Agent Budiansky?
Did I get that right?

204
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:32,160
The captain told me
you were coming in.

205
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,871
Welcome to The Punisher Task Force.

206
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,456
I'm Detective Martin Soap.

207
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,292
Pleasure.

208
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,836
Make yourself at home.

209
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,672
You have a degree
in Behavioral Psychology?

210
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,591
Surprised?

211
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,301
That's okay. Most people are.

212
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,639
So, what do you actually do here?

213
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,558
Here?

214
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,144
This is ground zero.

215
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,481
I've shadowed his every step
for the last five years.

216
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:05,611
I've documented every murder
that fit his profile...

217
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,697
...and I've collected intelligence
on all known associates.

218
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:10,365
Take a look at this.

219
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,745
Six years ago...

220
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:18,540
...Frank Castle
was a Special Forces instructor.

221
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,045
And a simple family man.

222
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,756
One day, he takes his wife and kids
for a picnic...

223
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:29,593
...and by chance or fate,
depending on which you believe in...

224
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:32,679
...they witnessed a mob execution.

225
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,514
When they were discovered...

226
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,186
But Castle survived.

227
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:47,569
Since then, he's been taking down
one crime family after another.

228
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,742
I'm really close, Budiansky.

229
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:57,412
Only thing getting in my way
is some bad luck.

230
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,916
But I have a feeling
that's about to change.

231
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,086
You know, I've been waiting
for someone like you.

232
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,297
Take a look at some of the case files.

233
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,632
Get a lay of the land.

234
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,551
I'll get us a pie from Milano's.
Best pizza in the city.

235
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,387
Which drawer?

236
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:16,640
- What?
- The alleged Punisher murders.

237
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,102
All of them.

238
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,141
What do you want, Micro?

239
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,436
You ever heard of jihadi-blogger.com?

240
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,604
I'm posing
as a one-armed Wahhabi warrior...

241
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:07,315
...who took a crap in a cave
next to Bin Laden.

242
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,985
I think I can score you
a couple of rocket launchers.

243
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:11,278
What do you want?

244
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,157
Haven't seen you in a while.

245
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,119
Brought you some treats.

246
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:23,123
It's gun show season in Virginia.
No background checks, no problems.

247
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,503
That's too much, Frank.

248
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,964
Call it a retirement package.

249
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,594
I know this thing with the fed
is eating you up...

250
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,888
...but that doesn't mean
you pack up your tent.

251
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,890
We all make mistakes, Frank.

252
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:42,350
You're fighting a war
against the assholes...

253
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,103
...who slip through the raindrops,
who get away with it.

254
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,523
In any war, there's collateral damage.
You know that.

255
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,026
Collateral damage?

256
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,616
I killed an agent in the field.

257
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:00,035
One of the good guys.

258
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,454
He had a family.

259
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,581
You didn't know.

260
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,461
I fucked up, Micro.

261
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,215
Now, please...

262
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,342
...just leave me alone.

263
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,069
Where the fuck's Nicky?

264
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:37,739
He...

265
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,032
...didn't make it.

266
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,784
Nicky was a fucking rat.

267
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,744
For the feds.

268
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,289
What about my money?

269
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,793
We already went to his place
and tore it apart.

270
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,254
No sign of a safety deposit key
or nothing.

271
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,339
Does he got any next of kin?

272
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,175
Somebody to carry on
the family name?

273
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,011
Yeah. Something about
a wife and a girl.

274
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,429
Good.

275
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:02,722
Let's look there.

276
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,266
You got it.

277
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:05,976
Hey, doc.

278
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,185
Where you been?

279
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,937
- Am I glad to see you.
- Hi, Billy.

280
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,982
Should've seen those fucking
brascioles at the clinic.

281
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:15,318
Must have bought their fucking
medical degrees off the Internet.

282
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,237
How did you end up at a free clinic?

283
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,322
Insurance said I missed a payment.

284
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,032
Can you fucking believe that?

285
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,618
Okay. Before we do this...

286
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,872
...I need you to understand
the severity of your injuries.

287
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,457
You shouldn't have been able
to survive this.

288
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,710
Well, that's why I'm here, doc.

289
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:34,796
I have the best plastic surgeon
in all of New York.

290
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:39,467
Your facial muscles, tendons,
bone structure, everything...

291
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,052
...was destroyed.

292
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,139
And there wasn't a single square inch
of skin left intact.

293
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,224
Just take it off already.

294
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,560
Okay.

295
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,312
Let's do this.

296
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,940
I'm gonna need you
to sit forward a little bit.

297
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,400
All right.

298
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,947
Okay.

299
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:04,784
Polymers...

300
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:13,501
...a few strategically placed
alloy plates...

301
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:19,090
...and just a little bit of horse hide.

302
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,343
A little bit of what?

303
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,857
I need to talk to my doctor alone.

304
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,985
Yeah. Yeah, of course, Billy.

305
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:46,618
The fuck's the matter with you?
You can't control yourself?

306
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,244
You know how sensitive he is.

307
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:52,207
I'm sorry, Pops, it's just, I've...
Have you ever seen anything so...?

308
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,541
Just shut the fuck up.

309
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,570
You okay, boss?

310
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,990
Much better. Thanks.

311
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,755
I'll be in the car.

312
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,850
No more distractions.

313
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,601
We need to focus on my goals.

314
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,228
One:

315
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:57,897
We need to get my money back.

316
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:00,859
Two, we're gonna get rid
of Frank Castle.

317
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,153
But he took out, like, 30 of us.

318
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:06,406
I mean, how are we gonna kill him
before he'll kill us?

319
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,241
My brother will take care of that.

320
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,285
- Loony Bin Jim?
- Shut the fuck up.

321
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,580
His name is James.

322
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:17,667
Not Loony Bin Jim, not LBJ. James.

323
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,794
I'm sorry. It's a good idea.

324
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,338
Really, it is.

325
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,090
Don't mind him.

326
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:28,011
He doesn't think before he talks,
just like his mother.

327
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,471
Sorry about that, Billy.

328
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:32,390
Billy is dead.

329
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,601
From now on...

330
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,395
...you call me Jigsaw.

331
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,964
He's mine.

332
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:49,008
Hey, Billy, fuck you!

333
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,431
Daddy!

334
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,695
How are we doing today,
Loony Bin Jim?

335
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,169
Yummy, yummy.

336
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,551
So good.

337
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,431
- What?
- Dr. Basner. Open up!

338
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,433
Yes, doctor.

339
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,370
Billy?

340
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,289
Is that you?

341
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,294
It is.

342
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:10,298
You look fantastic, brother.

343
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,556
Ink, cut these off, now.

344
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:22,393
Pittsy, go open the doors
of every other cell...

345
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,064
- ...lead everybody out the front door.
- Sure thing, Billy.

346
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,440
Jigsaw.

347
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,360
I'll take care of this guy.

348
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,737
Oh, no, brother.

349
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,323
Fatso's mine.

350
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,326
Of course.

351
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,998
I'm gonna get my applesauce back.

352
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,834
Did you know...

353
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:51,422
...kidneys and applesauce
are a delicacy in Sweden?

354
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,676
Did you know that?

355
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,594
Yes.

356
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:04,560
Yummy, yummy, yummy
in my tummy, tummy, tummy.

357
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,356
No.

358
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,404
What do you say, boss?

359
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,656
- Stuff might come in handy.
- What for?

360
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:21,995
Well, in case he starts,
you know, not feeling so good.

361
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,918
I think he's doing just great.

362
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,578
You're in my light.

363
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,092
For the next time
someone gets in your light.

364
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,396
Step the fuck away from my little girl.

365
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,939
Mom, that's a dad word.

366
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,191
Go inside, Grace.

367
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:42,533
You're messing with the wrong family
on the wrong day, asshole.

368
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,122
You, you're...

369
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:50,583
What are you doing here?

370
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,919
What makes you think
you could come here?

371
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:55,171
- You'll scare the girl.
- Shut up.

372
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,381
Shut your mouth.

373
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:01,552
- I'm sorry.
- I said shut up.

374
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,723
What's this?

375
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,142
Something to help out.

376
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:09,811
No.

377
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,979
No, you don't get to do that.

378
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:15,817
You don't get to shoot my husband in
cold blood and then stop at the ATM.

379
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:17,402
It's for your daughter.

380
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:21,948
This is what you deserve.

381
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:23,825
What you did to Nick.

382
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,747
Who punishes you?

383
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:35,294
He taught you how to shoot.

384
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,048
A good agent keeps his family safe...

385
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,551
...but he couldn't always be here.

386
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,013
He took you out to the range.

387
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,182
He showed you what to do.

388
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:53,771
This is where you do it.

389
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,401
Squeeze...

390
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,111
...don't pull.

391
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:14,000
I can't find my red pen.

392
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,381
Mom, I need it.

393
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,763
You take it.

394
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,100
Is this it, boss?

395
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:14,435
Yeah.

396
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,437
Nice, brother.

397
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,856
- Is it yours?
- Not yet.

398
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,109
Old Cesare used to rent it
to screw hookers.

399
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,571
Let's go inside
before I freeze my fucking balls off.

400
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,882
What's the matter, Billy?

401
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,928
Just when I think I'm okay...

402
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,264
...I see my reflection somewhere...

403
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,643
...and I look horrible.

404
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,981
What has he done to me?

405
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:01,983
No, no, no, don't.

406
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,985
Don't cry, brother.

407
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,904
Everything is gonna be all right.

408
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,740
I promise you two things:

409
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,660
One, I will find Castle...

410
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:17,999
...and I will kill him
slowly and painfully.

411
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:24,839
And two, you will never, ever
have to look at your reflection again...

412
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,800
...as long as you're with me.

413
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:37,912
You're not in Transylvania anymore,
Cristu.

414
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,747
We don't talk vampire.

415
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,916
It's Russian.

416
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,711
My man is concerned.

417
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:50,257
If Punisher can do this to your face...

418
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:51,884
...what might he do to our deal?

419
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:56,722
The tongue stretches further
than most people think.

420
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:00,226
Ask your man
how he's gonna talk that shit...

421
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:01,936
...when I pull it from his mouth.

422
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:06,440
Enough.

423
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,734
The Punisher is not a problem.

424
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,903
The docks are mine.

425
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,198
My looks have nothing to do with this.

426
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,991
Everybody...

427
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:19,954
...from the local security to
international customs is in my pocket.

428
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:25,209
Quite frankly, this job doesn't get done
without me.

429
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:08,377
My most sincere apologies.

430
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:12,089
My father always say
never insult your host.

431
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,467
Sounds like a reasonable man.

432
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,304
You don't know of my father.

433
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,229
Three days.

434
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,273
It has to be 12 million.

435
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,819
We agree on 10.

436
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,446
We both know...

437
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:39,867
...that this biological shit
you're bringing in isn't leaving the city.

438
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:44,121
You're selling it
to the ragheads in Queens.

439
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:47,041
The ports have been crawling
with suits from Homeland.

440
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,794
Gonna take a lot of payola
to keep it quiet.

441
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:04,391
Always knew you'd be a good boss,
Billy.

442
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:06,185
Thanks, brother.

443
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:49,937
Latin Kings.

444
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,773
Let him go, Frank.

445
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,275
You know this piece of shit?

446
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,110
Ex piece of shit.

447
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:57,611
Yeah.

448
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,613
He's a regular choirboy.

449
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,782
- Fuck you, cracker.
- Language.

450
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,534
It's a genius racket.

451
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,370
You know how the cops
always run those gun buy-backs?

452
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,289
Except they never work.

453
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:12,293
Because what banger
is gonna trust a cop, right?

454
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:16,255
Well, these drive-by wack jobs,
they just love Carlos here.

455
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,966
They get one look at that ink...

456
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,843
...and they know he's for real.

457
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:24,722
We get the guns off the street to you.

458
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:27,766
Never once seen a banger
that could quit.

459
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,435
Too fucking stupid.

460
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,313
He's straight, Frank.

461
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:36,567
Hey, Mom, Frank's here.

462
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:39,445
He says eat up, huh?

463
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:40,738
How's she doing?

464
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,490
Yeah, well.

465
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:48,996
As long as she's got her
cooking shows, she's good.

466
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,623
It's the only thing she notices.

467
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,292
But, hey, that's something, right?

468
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,839
Listen, I...

469
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,801
I just came around to tell you
that I'm going out of town for a while.

470
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:04,845
Out of town?

471
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:11,018
I'm sorry.

472
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:14,438
I never thought of The Punisher
taking a long weekend.

473
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,649
I'm not planning on coming back.

474
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:21,362
So I take it things didn't go so well
at the Donatelli home?

475
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:26,325
Are you aware
that Billy Russoti survived?

476
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,535
I heard.

477
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,373
Let the cops take care of him.

478
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:34,792
You and I know
they got nothing on him.

479
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:37,836
Their hands are tied.
This is where The Punisher comes in.

480
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:41,048
This is why I believe in you,
why I supported you all these years.

481
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:44,385
You want me to tell you when
something happens to Mrs. Donatelli?

482
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:46,053
That's what's gonna happen.

483
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,180
You don't think
he's gonna go for revenge?

484
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:51,100
It's not a question of if,
it's a matter of when.

485
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:03,237
- Pull a couple of Berettas.
- For what?

486
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:07,449
Three...

487
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:08,659
...two...

488
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:10,411
...one.

489
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,958
Russoti is the last one, then I'm done.

490
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:17,501
From your lips to God's ears.

491
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,211
You know where I can find him?

492
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:21,213
I don't have a fix on him.

493
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,799
You wiped out his associates
that are known to me.

494
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,509
I saw him with some new guys.

495
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,345
Leader was black, dreadlocks.

496
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,514
Did some acrobatic stuff
over the roofs.

497
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,808
That's Maginty
and his urban free-flow gang.

498
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,935
He's a mean motherfucker.

499
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,646
He's on a constant meth high.

500
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,363
Well, come on.

501
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,283
You wanna find this guy or not?

502
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,412
You boys play nice.

503
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:07,384
- I've been looking for you.
- Agent Budiansky, take a load off.

504
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,762
I need to go see Castle.
Where do I find him?

505
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:13,057
Rats, you know, he just left.

506
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,143
Wait, wait, wait.

507
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:18,562
You know what I like to do?

508
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:21,315
I like to sit in my car...

509
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:25,152
...and listen to the CB radio
and follow the crime.

510
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:29,239
We might just run into him.
It's never worked for me in five years...

511
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:32,659
...but I'm not the luckiest guy
on the planet, you know?

512
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,677
Let's go through the back door.

513
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:09,404
Maginty and his boys are planning
to hit a convenience store...

514
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:10,614
...on 45th and 2nd.

515
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:29,007
Suspects are armed and dangerous.

516
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:32,845
I repeat,
suspects are armed and dangerous.

517
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:34,847
Let's do this.

518
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,391
Really?

519
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:38,642
Just drive the car.

520
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:43,480
Come on. Come on.

521
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:18,557
Oh, fuck.

522
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,071
Please.

523
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:34,531
Please.

524
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:38,118
- Don't kill me.
- Russoti.

525
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,162
- Where is he?
- Your man, Jigsaw.

526
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:43,707
I was just with him. He was supposed
to give me some dough for a job.

527
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,626
But turns out...

528
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,837
...he don't have any anymore.

529
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:53,300
He forgot he gave a whole bunch
to that FBI rat bastard.

530
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:58,305
So he went to go see
Donatelli's wee bitch to get it back.

531
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,267
Something for something.

532
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,144
Mr. Punisher, sir.

533
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,485
So when did Donattelli
go undercover?

534
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:13,487
We were partners in narcotics.

535
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:18,283
Unfortunately, most of the blow
we confiscated ended up in my nose.

536
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:21,787
Internal Affairs
tried to get Nicky to rat me out.

537
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:22,996
He wouldn't.

538
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:25,332
So they send him undercover.

539
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,961
He's dead because of me.

540
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,091
So you still skiing the old alps?

541
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:36,718
No.

542
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:39,012
That's in the past.

543
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:44,184
- Holy shit.
- Shit.

544
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:58,949
Drive around,
meet me on the other side.

545
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:25,142
Mommy.

546
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,731
Hello, Mrs. Donatelli.

547
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:33,150
Or will you be calling yourself Miss
from now on?

548
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:34,526
What do you want from us?

549
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,361
I'm looking for my money...

550
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:38,947
...which your rat of a husband
stole from me.

551
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,657
We don't have it, I swear to God.

552
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,747
How about you, sweetcheeks?

553
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:49,750
Would you also like to swear
on an imaginary friend?

554
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:54,421
Make sure they don't move.

555
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:56,882
- We'll look for the money.
- Hey, kid.

556
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:02,888
Freeze, asshole!

557
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,265
You're under arrest.

558
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,035
Stay out of my way.

559
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:17,421
Listen to me.

560
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:20,465
Russoti is headed
to the Donattelli house.

561
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:23,135
He's probably already there.

562
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:25,178
You have to let me go.

563
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:28,014
You have the right to shut the fuck up!

564
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,277
Mommy.

565
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,013
Damn it. Cops.

566
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:28,408
- Evening, officers.
- Is everything okay in there?

567
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,036
No.

568
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:32,829
Everything is not okay.

569
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,290
Follow me.

570
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,341
Officer.

571
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,719
Oh, no, you don't.

572
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,736
Well, well, well.

573
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:08,323
This day was bound to come
sooner or later, wasn't it?

574
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:12,536
Have you heard back
from the patrol car?

575
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:15,705
Soap.

576
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:20,043
I tried a couple of times.
There was no answer.

577
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:32,472
Listen, we gotta get out of here
before more pigs arrive.

578
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:35,600
- No!
- Where is my fucking money?

579
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:37,894
My husband has a safe
upstairs in the bedroom.

580
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:41,773
I don't know if it's there but I can give
you the combination. 10-12-19-65.

581
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,150
Oh, how cute.

582
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:47,112
Is that your dead husband's birthday?

583
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,667
Let me help you.

584
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,759
- Get him to the station.
- You bet.

585
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,862
Let me out.

586
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,657
You know, Frank...

587
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:35,785
...throwing you a tip now and again
is one thing.

588
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:39,039
Password to the crime database
et cetera, but letting you go?

589
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:41,166
- Soap.
- Fine.

590
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:54,804
How you doing?

591
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:10,445
Nineteen.

592
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:18,870
Fuck!

593
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:23,041
Fuck that...

594
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:35,053
What was that?

595
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,347
Go check it out.

596
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:41,893
What the fuck are you waiting for,
Christmas?

597
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:11,047
Now.

598
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,091
You, sit down.

599
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:22,726
I'm calling this in.

600
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:25,812
Put your hands behind your back.

601
00:59:28,148 --> 00:59:30,734
Goddamn it, Castle!

602
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,571
Where do you think you're going?

603
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,657
Castle!

604
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:44,831
I repeat, request immediate backup.

605
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,548
Don't worry, I'm here.

606
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,383
Give me your fucking gun.

607
00:59:58,178 --> 00:59:59,220
Fuck!

608
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:02,515
Stay right where you fucking are.

609
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:08,980
We did it, Budiansky, huh?

610
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:10,774
Would you mind explaining to me...

611
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,067
...how a handcuffed criminal
escapes custody...

612
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:15,945
...from the back of your locked car?

613
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:18,323
That Castle's a slippery one.

614
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:32,879
You'll be safe here.

615
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:36,049
We can manage on our own.

616
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:38,885
Just until we know
Russoti's been arrested.

617
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:44,682
Grace.

618
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:47,227
Grace, we're leaving soon, honey.

619
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,355
She's smart.

620
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,524
Go ahead. Open it.

621
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:27,559
It belonged to my daughter.

622
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:30,395
Here.

623
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:54,210
Put that down, honey.

624
01:01:57,630 --> 01:01:59,090
It...

625
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,634
...was Lisa's favorite toy.

626
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:06,764
She got so angry when her little
brother used to hide it from her.

627
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:09,183
Does she care if I play with it?

628
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:12,854
No.

629
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:34,125
You're gonna fry
for killing two of my officers, Billy.

630
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:37,837
- I want a lawyer.
- Oh, you'll get your fucking lawyer.

631
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:40,298
But no lawyer's gonna get you
out of this one...

632
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:41,716
...you ugly piece of shit.

633
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:02,445
Agent Miller, what are you doing here?

634
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:03,988
Russoti.

635
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:07,533
- What's he got to do with the bureau?
- The case Donatelli was working on.

636
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:10,662
He says he's got some intel,
he wants to make a deal.

637
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:12,538
Anyone know where he is right now?

638
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:14,457
Brought him into
the observation room.

639
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:15,708
Good.

640
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:19,587
Yeah?

641
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,547
Captain, Agent Miller from the bureau.

642
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:24,384
I believe you were informed
I'll be taking over this?

643
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,056
This perp killed two of my officers...

644
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:33,726
...and terrorized the widow and child
of one of your agents.

645
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:36,437
You keep that in mind, Miller.

646
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:43,611
You're lucky I came to you with this.

647
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:46,364
That I'm a patriot.

648
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:48,241
Just like you.

649
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:49,993
I shit red, white and blue.

650
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:52,620
The reason you came to me
is because you got caught.

651
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:54,664
So don't insult my intelligence, okay?

652
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:56,749
You tell me what you know.

653
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,251
If it's any good...

654
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:00,837
...I'll recommend life without parole.

655
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:05,758
This deal is going down tonight.

656
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:10,763
I know when and I know where.

657
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:15,018
So you're gonna give me
and my brother here the immunity...

658
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:16,936
...and the money...

659
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:21,190
...or you're gonna have to explain
to Wolf fucking Blitzer...

660
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:25,445
...why you had the lead on the thing
that killed half the fucking city...

661
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:28,614
...and you didn't do
a goddamn thing about it.

662
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:34,495
I'll be right back.

663
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:36,414
Oh, and Miller?

664
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:38,916
There's just one other little thing.

665
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:46,526
Happy?

666
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:56,953
Go, go, go.

667
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,454
Get them alive.

668
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:01,165
Homeland Security, put your weapons
on the ground.

669
01:06:01,332 --> 01:06:03,167
Do it now!

670
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:05,878
You're a fucking dead man.

671
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:08,714
My father will kill you, you hear me?

672
01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:11,592
My father will serve your head
on a fucking silver platter.

673
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:13,845
Walk down to your right.

674
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:16,722
Stand clear.

675
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:18,141
Agent Miller.

676
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:20,476
As agreed.

677
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:23,020
The other condition of our agreement?

678
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:25,481
Clear the area.

679
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:30,736
I hope to God he finds you
and you get what you deserve.

680
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:54,302
- How long was I...?
- A long time.

681
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,513
- You should eat.
- Grace.

682
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,390
- What is it?
- Egg and cheese...

683
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:01,184
...MREs, that's all I have.

684
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,768
What's an MRE?

685
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:05,271
Meal ready-to-eat.

686
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:08,858
Military food.
It's great for people who can't cook.

687
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:12,445
Look, Grace,
this one came with Chuckles.

688
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:15,281
That's the best one to get.

689
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:17,116
Not exactly a balanced breakfast.

690
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:19,160
Out of practice.

691
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:24,040
Not one more step.

692
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:33,007
- Where's Micro?
- His mother isn't feeling well.

693
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:35,009
- He didn't want to leave her.
- Damn it.

694
01:07:35,343 --> 01:07:36,677
I need to talk to him.

695
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:39,180
This is Carlos.

696
01:07:39,347 --> 01:07:40,932
He's...

697
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:42,308
...a friend of mine.

698
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:46,020
He's gonna hang
while I take care of some things.

699
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:48,856
- Hi, Carlos. I'm Grace.
- Hey, little girl.

700
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:50,483
We're gonna be homeys, right?

701
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:54,320
Yeah, we're gonna be tight.

702
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:56,489
This will all be over soon.

703
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:58,491
Then you can go.

704
01:08:05,665 --> 01:08:07,667
Don't go.

705
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:24,976
I need you alert.

706
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:28,646
Don't make me regret this.

707
01:08:37,863 --> 01:08:39,865
That was fun.

708
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:44,036
Now, let's go kill Castle
in his miserable hole.

709
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:46,163
No, not yet.

710
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:48,958
We're gonna have ourselves
a little bit of fun with this.

711
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:52,628
Next time he has to face us
and a fucking army.

712
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:54,380
Where do we get the army from?

713
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:56,757
Just like Uncle Sam, bro.

714
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:59,677
We recruit in troubled neighborhoods.

715
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:02,388
Offer a hundred grand
towards a college education...

716
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:06,225
...they'll never get and promise
nobody ever has to go to Iraq.

717
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:10,396
Just as long as I get to kill Castle.

718
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,523
Don't worry, brother, you will.

719
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:16,569
Just making damn sure this time
he don't come back breathing.

720
01:09:44,221 --> 01:09:46,015
Here we have garlic, onion...

721
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:49,310
...a little paprika rub
on a rare roast beef.

722
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:07,953
Hello, sports fans.

723
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:17,421
And how are you today, my friend?

724
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:19,548
Run! Get out of here!

725
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:21,217
Hey.

726
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:23,219
I axed you a question.

727
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:24,428
Run!

728
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,517
You don't answer.

729
01:10:29,683 --> 01:10:32,686
Guess I'll have to ax it again.

730
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:36,232
Here I come.

731
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:18,899
Good.

732
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:22,194
Bring them upstairs
and meet me back down here.

733
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:26,198
Let's see if we can talk
a few poor bastards into signing up.

734
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:36,667
Where are they?

735
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:44,550
I tried. I swear I tried.

736
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:46,135
Goddamn it.

737
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:47,887
Don't die on me.

738
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:50,431
I'm bleeding out.

739
01:11:50,598 --> 01:11:52,141
I've seen this show before.

740
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,434
Shut up, kid.

741
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:54,852
You're gonna be fine.

742
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:56,520
It hurts real bad.

743
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:59,023
Hurts real bad, Frank.

744
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,610
Don't let me die like this, man.

745
01:12:02,776 --> 01:12:04,069
Not like this.

746
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:16,832
See you in hell.

747
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:19,793
I see you anywhere near hell...

748
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:21,253
...I'll kick your ass out.

749
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:48,572
I haven't seen you in ages, Frank.

750
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:52,493
Whatever it is, it must be pretty bad.

751
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,954
Maybe I'm just here
to see an old friend, Mike.

752
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,622
Yeah, right.

753
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:59,500
- I haven't seen you since...
- The funeral.

754
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:01,126
I know.

755
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,128
I've been reading about you.

756
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:07,007
You've been a long a way
from the seminary, my friend.

757
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:11,178
I don't even remember that
as part of my life.

758
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:13,556
Why do you do this?

759
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:16,225
Somebody has to punish the corrupt.

760
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:20,813
For in the same way you judge others,
you will be judged.

761
01:13:21,146 --> 01:13:24,984
And with the measure you use,
it will be measured to you.

762
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:28,195
Matthew...

763
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:30,155
...7:2.

764
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:33,158
I'm okay with that.

765
01:13:34,326 --> 01:13:35,494
God be with you, Frank.

766
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:44,003
Sometimes I'd like to get
my hands on God.

767
01:14:00,352 --> 01:14:02,271
Interesting choice for a meeting place.

768
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:05,274
I didn't take you for a religious man,
Castle.

769
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,151
Yeah, well...

770
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:09,612
- ...an eye for an eye.
- If I remember right...

771
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:12,531
...they're not called
the Ten Suggestions.

772
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,992
Russoti's got Angela and Grace.

773
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:18,037
- How?
- Doesn't matter.

774
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:21,373
Maybe if you'd put them in protective
custody like you should have...

775
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,542
...we wouldn't be
having this conversation.

776
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:25,336
They'd be dead.

777
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:28,380
The law can't touch him, Castle.

778
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:30,841
Total immunity.

779
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:34,720
Unless you've got a videotape
of Russoti taking them.

780
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:37,139
We can't even give him
a parking ticket.

781
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:39,850
It's a fucked-up system
you're sworn to protect.

782
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:41,560
Never said it was perfect.

783
01:14:43,354 --> 01:14:45,981
He wants me in exchange for them.

784
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,984
I need you to secure the trade.

785
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:51,820
Okay...

786
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:54,073
...but I'm doing this by the book.

787
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:56,909
What book do you think
they're going by, huh?

788
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:59,453
I took an oath, Castle.

789
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:02,873
- There are laws.
- No official police procedure.

790
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,917
You wanna come along?

791
01:15:05,084 --> 01:15:07,211
Leave your badge at home.

792
01:15:10,714 --> 01:15:13,884
- I have to think about it.
- Clock's ticking.

793
01:15:37,282 --> 01:15:38,367
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

794
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:39,743
Relax.

795
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:44,123
We're looking for a few good men.

796
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:48,794
And we'd like to offer you
the opportunity to be...

797
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:50,462
...all that you can be.

798
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:56,468
Now, we've all suffered loss
at the hands of The Punisher.

799
01:15:57,136 --> 01:16:00,264
And because we don't
look like everybody else...

800
01:16:00,431 --> 01:16:03,642
...and because we don't act
like everybody else...

801
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:06,729
...nobody does a goddamn thing
about it.

802
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:09,440
Well, I say...

803
01:16:09,606 --> 01:16:13,986
...he ain't the only one who can take
the law into his own hands.

804
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:19,491
So if you're as sick of this cocksucker
as I am...

805
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:20,993
...raise your armies.

806
01:16:21,493 --> 01:16:23,454
You'll be well-paid...

807
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:25,330
...you'll be well-armed...

808
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:28,625
...and at the end of it...

809
01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:31,503
...The Punisher will be dead.

810
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:52,376
Agent Budiansky,
just in time for happy hour.

811
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:55,128
You need to come with me.

812
01:17:55,295 --> 01:17:56,338
Where to?

813
01:17:56,505 --> 01:18:00,300
Your partner Frank Castle needs help.

814
01:18:01,718 --> 01:18:04,638
"Partner" is a little bit
of an exaggeration.

815
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:06,598
How did you know?

816
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:09,643
Oh, usually,
unless you've arrested Houdini...

817
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:12,271
...a handcuffed criminal
does not escape that easily.

818
01:18:12,437 --> 01:18:14,648
You know,
you're not as stupid as you...

819
01:18:14,815 --> 01:18:15,858
I didn't say that.

820
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:22,197
- Who are we looking for?
- Cristu's father.

821
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:26,118
I don't think this is a good idea.

822
01:18:37,421 --> 01:18:38,964
What?

823
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:41,216
We're looking for Tiberiu.
Cristu's father.

824
01:18:44,928 --> 01:18:46,889
- Why?
- If I were Tiberiu...

825
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:48,932
...I'd probably wanna find the man...

826
01:18:49,099 --> 01:18:53,145
...who was responsible for sending
my son to prison for the rest of his life.

827
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:55,480
And how would you do that?

828
01:18:55,647 --> 01:18:58,066
I'd tell him when and where
to find him.

829
01:18:58,775 --> 01:19:00,485
What do you want from it?

830
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:04,281
I don't like him
and I want him taken care of.

831
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:09,995
No worries, my friend.

832
01:19:38,815 --> 01:19:40,692
All right, lock and load. Lock and load.

833
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:43,028
- Let's knock him down.
- Get ready.

834
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:08,220
Here they are.

835
01:20:08,553 --> 01:20:10,263
Oh, boy.

836
01:20:42,879 --> 01:20:45,257
Take it easy, James.

837
01:20:45,757 --> 01:20:47,009
He'll be here.

838
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:52,681
- You get it.
- Fuck that, man. You get it.

839
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:54,057
I'll get it.

840
01:20:57,769 --> 01:21:01,273
- What you looking for?
- I'm here to see the Jigsaw.

841
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:04,276
You're out of luck. No Jigsaw here.

842
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:08,822
I'm here for The Punisher party.

843
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:19,916
Who's the old man?

844
01:21:21,043 --> 01:21:23,086
It's Cristu's father.

845
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:25,881
Old-country genocidal maniac.

846
01:21:26,048 --> 01:21:28,717
Figured he'd stir up
a shit storm for us.

847
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:32,304
Cops will be all over this place
once the fireworks start.

848
01:21:32,471 --> 01:21:33,889
I wouldn't worry about that.

849
01:21:34,056 --> 01:21:36,308
I called in a explosives permit.

850
01:21:36,475 --> 01:21:40,312
Construction crew. Said we'd be
blasting dynamite all night.

851
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:41,897
So...

852
01:21:42,147 --> 01:21:43,857
...what's the plan?

853
01:21:44,107 --> 01:21:46,234
I'm going in to get them.

854
01:21:47,778 --> 01:21:49,696
You call that a plan?

855
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:52,032
It's all I need.

856
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:55,202
Well, I'm going in with you.

857
01:21:57,704 --> 01:22:01,041
Never took the time to think about
where I was headed.

858
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:04,586
I'm far down that road.

859
01:22:06,379 --> 01:22:07,672
You're not going there.

860
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:12,427
Thanks, Frank.

861
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:15,597
You know he's gonna take it out on me
when he wakes up.

862
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:19,976
If you don't hear gunfire
for longer than five minutes...

863
01:22:20,143 --> 01:22:23,772
...the girls are not here, set him loose.

864
01:24:57,842 --> 01:24:59,928
Come on, get him. Go, go, go.

865
01:25:37,173 --> 01:25:38,842
Quiet, fool.

866
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:01,698
It's time.

867
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:04,534
James, be careful.

868
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:54,459
Oh, for fuck's sake.

869
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:30,954
Won't be replacing
that son of yours any time soon.

870
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:36,793
Blood in the urine.
Early indicator of kidney failure.

871
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:43,591
You should be seeing double
right about now.

872
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:47,679
That would be a torn meniscus.

873
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:33,600
- James.
- Gun.

874
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:40,982
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

875
01:28:43,568 --> 01:28:44,944
Mom.

876
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,405
- Please, help us.
- Shut the fuck up.

877
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:49,282
Come on, Castle.

878
01:28:49,449 --> 01:28:51,242
Don't be shy.

879
01:28:55,747 --> 01:28:57,749
Throw down your gun.

880
01:29:03,963 --> 01:29:06,508
- Die, you bastard.
- No.

881
01:29:06,674 --> 01:29:09,844
James, that's no way
to punish The Punisher.

882
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:31,449
Nice shooter.

883
01:29:43,836 --> 01:29:45,046
Catch.

884
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,048
Let's play a game, what do you say?

885
01:29:48,132 --> 01:29:50,009
You got one round left in there.

886
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:53,471
You shoot one of these two.

887
01:29:54,013 --> 01:29:55,765
I'll let the other one go free.

888
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:58,768
What do you say, Frank?

889
01:29:58,935 --> 01:30:01,563
Who's it to be,
your fat friend right here?

890
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:04,148
Or that nice little piece
of jailbait over there?

891
01:30:04,315 --> 01:30:05,817
Burn in hell.

892
01:30:05,984 --> 01:30:07,986
Okay, then they both die.

893
01:30:08,152 --> 01:30:09,654
Frank.

894
01:30:09,988 --> 01:30:11,990
She's a kid.

895
01:30:13,157 --> 01:30:14,867
Shoot me.

896
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:32,260
Okay, fuck it. Kill her first.

897
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:33,636
- No.
- Stop.

898
01:30:36,931 --> 01:30:39,183
He's made a decision.

899
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:43,855
Not looking too good for you, fatso.

900
01:30:47,692 --> 01:30:49,986
After three, Castle.

901
01:30:50,361 --> 01:30:52,030
One.

902
01:30:52,947 --> 01:30:54,365
Two.

903
01:30:54,532 --> 01:30:56,367
You won't feel a thing, Micro.

904
01:30:58,202 --> 01:30:59,287
Three.

905
01:31:27,565 --> 01:31:29,233
God...

906
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:44,791
Frank.

907
01:31:54,842 --> 01:31:56,427
Get out.

908
01:32:20,743 --> 01:32:22,578
Fuck you.

909
01:32:22,745 --> 01:32:25,123
Let me put you out of my misery.

910
01:32:30,878 --> 01:32:33,172
This is just the beginning.

911
01:32:57,238 --> 01:32:58,489
You okay?

912
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:02,034
- Where's Castle?
- Still inside.

913
01:33:02,201 --> 01:33:03,911
And Micro?

914
01:33:08,791 --> 01:33:09,834
Frank.

915
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:12,044
Frank, are you okay?

916
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:21,596
You better get out of here.

917
01:33:21,763 --> 01:33:24,682
Yeah. Come on, Frank,
I'll buy you a drink.

918
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:25,892
Wait.

919
01:33:26,058 --> 01:33:27,393
Wait.

920
01:33:28,478 --> 01:33:29,896
My husband...

921
01:33:30,062 --> 01:33:31,522
...Nicky.

922
01:33:32,315 --> 01:33:33,399
We talked about you.

923
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:37,028
Argued about you.

924
01:33:39,822 --> 01:33:42,158
He said you were
one of the good guys.

925
01:34:27,286 --> 01:34:28,871
You know, buddy.

926
01:34:29,038 --> 01:34:31,332
Maybe it's time to quit now, huh?

927
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:35,253
I mean, you must
get tired of this, right?

928
01:34:35,419 --> 01:34:37,755
And I think you got
all the criminals in town.

929
01:34:37,922 --> 01:34:39,507
If there are any left...

930
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:42,802
...they ought to
at least consider rehabilitation.

931
01:34:43,094 --> 01:34:46,514
I mean, contrary to popular belief,
people can change.

932
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:48,182
I guess what I'm saying is...

933
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:51,769
...I'm just personally
not a fan of the death penalty.

934
01:34:53,437 --> 01:34:54,939
Frank?

935
01:34:55,773 --> 01:34:57,275
Where did he go?

936
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:59,193
Hey.

937
01:35:00,069 --> 01:35:02,780
Give me your fucking wallet,
motherfucker.

938
01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:04,031
You're kidding, right?

939
01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:05,908
Do I look like I'm fucking kidding?

940
01:35:06,075 --> 01:35:07,243
Frank.

941
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:09,161
Give me your wallet.

942
01:35:09,912 --> 01:35:12,540
- Frank.
- Do you wanna die?

943
01:35:14,083 --> 01:35:16,168
For the last time, give me your wallet.

944
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:26,804
Oh, God. Now I've got
brain splattered all over me.
