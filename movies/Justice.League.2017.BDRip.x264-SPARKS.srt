1
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,496
<i>There he is!</i>

2
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,916
<i>Oh, sorry.</i>

3
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,596
<i>Superman, Superman,
can we ask you some questions?</i>

4
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,989
<i>It's for our podcast.</i>

5
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,190
<i>Well, in that case...</i>

6
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,114
<i>- How many people have you saved?
- I...</i>

7
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,556
<i>Never mind. Does your thing
really stand for hope?</i>

8
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,790
<i>Yes. It does.</i>

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,320
<i>But it looks like an S.</i>

10
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,834
<i>Yes. It's meant to. It's...</i>

11
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,156
<i>It's meant to wind like a river.</i>

12
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,152
<i>It comes and goes. My...</i>

13
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,398
<i>A man I knew used to say
hope is like your car keys.</i>

14
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,116
<i>Easy to lose, but if you dig around,
it's usually close by.</i>

15
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,078
<i>Did you ever fight a hippo?</i>

16
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,230
<i>No. That's dumb.</i>

17
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,193
<i>But hippos are the most deadly.</i>

18
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,192
<i>What is...</i>

19
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,198
<i>What's the best thing
about planet Earth?</i>

20
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,960
What are you doing?

21
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,358
Wait. No, wait. Wait. Wait!

22
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,718
Please! Please, man. Please!

23
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,393
What do you want from me?

24
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,914
Fear.

25
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,591
They can smell it.

26
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,713
What the hell?

27
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,156
What was that?

28
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,515
A scout.

29
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,794
From space?

30
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,639
<i>Like an alien army?</i>

31
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,393
<i>Alfred, are you seeing this?</i>

32
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,310
I am.
Matches the other sightings.

33
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,432
And that pattern is all over
Luthor's notes.

34
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,154
Prep the jet.
We're going north tonight.

35
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,600
Good. It's time then.

36
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,989
It's 'cause they know
he's dead, right?

37
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,829
Superman.

38
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,559
He's gone.

39
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,317
Where does that leave us?

40
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,196
Drop your guns now!

41
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,390
Excuse me.

42
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,715
Go!

43
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,912
Move it! Move! Move!

44
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,476
Get down!

45
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,517
Line them up along the wall!

46
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,830
Keep them quiet!

47
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,353
Children, stay close to me.

48
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,633
Who are you?

49
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,554
The Lasso of Hestia compels you
to reveal the truth.

50
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,834
Now, who are you?

51
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,434
We're a small group
of reactionary terrorists.

52
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,552
We know that sin has brought on
this plague of aliens.

53
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,353
Why the hostages?

54
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,758
You're too late.

55
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,957
The countdown's already begun.

56
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,000
In a few minutes, four city blocks...

57
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,280
while the world watches.

58
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,630
Hush!

59
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,796
Shut up!

60
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,758
This is man's best hope.

61
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,834
Down with the modern world.

62
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,234
Back to the Dark Ages

63
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,160
and the safety of holy fear.

64
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,070
Quiet!

65
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,914
This would've been over quickly,
but...

66
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,351
No! Don't!

67
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,950
I don't believe it.

68
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,435
What are you?

69
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,954
A believer.

70
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,832
I'm asking for your help.

71
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,438
I believe there is a stranger
who comes to this village from the sea.

72
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,871
He comes in the winter
when the people are hungry.

73
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,799
Brings fish.

74
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,717
He comes on the king tide.

75
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,349
That was last night.

76
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,600
Icebergs in the harbor, four months
since the last ship got through.

77
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,714
Well, this stranger doesn't come
by ship.

78
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,790
There are enemies coming
from far away.

79
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,760
I need warriors.

80
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,431
I'm building an alliance
to defend ourselves.

81
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,358
Look, I'll give you 25,000
to talk to this man right now.

82
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,715
Outside.

83
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,671
Tell me what those three boxes are
and I'll make it 30.

84
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,120
You should get out.

85
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,800
Can you at least point me
to Atlantis?

86
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,030
Arthur Curry.

87
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,235
Also known as Protector of the Oceans.

88
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,272
The Aquaman.

89
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,273
I hear you can talk to fish.

90
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,440
So let me get this straight.

91
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,156
You do it dressed like a bat?
Like an actual bat?

92
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,198
It's worked for 20 years in Gotham.

93
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,153
Oh, that shithole.

94
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,158
When the fight comes, we'll need you.

95
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,874
- Don't count on it, Batman.
- Why not?

96
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,275
'Cause I don't like you coming here,

97
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,238
digging into my business
and getting into my life.

98
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,512
People from Atlantis tell me, do this.
Now you say, do that.

99
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,750
I wanna be left alone.

100
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,151
Is that why you help these people
out here in the middle of nowhere?

101
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,635
'Cause you can just leave?

102
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,996
I help them 'cause no one else does.

103
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,915
If you want to protect them,
you need to work with me.

104
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,993
Strong man is strongest alone.
You ever heard that?

105
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,480
That's not a saying.

106
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,233
That's the opposite
of what the saying is.

107
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,629
Yeah...

108
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,637
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

109
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,439
You ever hear of Superman?

110
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,313
He died fighting next to me.

111
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,914
My point exactly.

112
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,634
What's in the three boxes?

113
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,600
It's ancient history.

114
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,790
What is it?

115
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,600
Mankind's melting the polar ice caps,
destroying the ecosystem.

116
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,876
They got it coming?

117
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,431
Hey, I don't mind if the oceans rise.

118
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,273
How about if they boil?

119
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,354
Dressed like a bat.

120
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,079
You're out of your mind, Bruce Wayne.

121
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,869
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

122
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,318
So, you say you have no way
of reconnecting with this Aquaman?

123
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,637
Oh, I put a tracking device
in his coat,

124
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,790
but he left without it.

125
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,592
May, in fact, not have been his coat.

126
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,954
Those squares from Luthor's notes.

127
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,271
I think they must be containers
of some kind.

128
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,476
Of what?

129
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,871
I don't know. Money. Power.

130
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,095
Something worth
starting a war over.

131
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,080
Well, we've had luck with one person
on the team list.

132
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,239
Barry Allen of Central City.

133
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,359
He's completely off the grid.

134
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,718
Squatting, I think.
Moves suddenly and often.

135
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,070
Disappearing act.

136
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,197
But he does visit his father.

137
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,520
In prison for murdering his mother.

138
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,710
Jesus.

139
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,236
Young Barry always protested
his father's innocence.

140
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,830
But he was nine
and nobody listened to him.

141
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,070
We have somebody at the prison?

142
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,152
Oh, yeah. We'll find the address.

143
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,675
What about Diana?

144
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,240
Well, you have her number.

145
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,400
What, you could've called her.

146
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,840
Perhaps I should fly to Paris
with a handwritten note.

147
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,511
Will you be Bruce's teammate?
Check yes or no.

148
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,353
I'm only interested in her skillset.

149
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,994
I'm sure you are.

150
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,435
Can we?

151
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,872
Well, facial recognition's
a bit dodgy on this one.

152
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,992
But they've got a partial match.

153
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,833
A Victor Stone.

154
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,070
Genius IQ,

155
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,154
football scholarship to GCU
and deceased.

156
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,994
Figures. Fairy tales and ghost stories.

157
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,389
One misses the days

158
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,156
when one's biggest concerns
were exploding wind-up penguins.

159
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,834
The simple life.

160
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,874
I don't recognize this world.

161
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,833
I don't have to recognize it.

162
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,471
I just have to save it.

163
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,109
Here to see Henry Allen.

164
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,034
Sign.

165
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,075
Hurry it up, will you?

166
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,834
What, you got a problem?

167
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,320
No, there's no problem.

168
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,030
Better not be.

169
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,830
You know where to go.

170
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,752
Are those prescription?

171
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,713
Or are you just trying
to look brainy?

172
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,877
Because you're
holding yourself back.

173
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,110
You're going in circles.

174
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,715
You're working three dead-end jobs,
going on four.

175
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,149
Where do you even have the time?

176
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,310
I make the time.

177
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,120
And this is all to pay
for a criminal justice degree, huh?

178
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,714
Okay, I really don't wanna
talk about this again.

179
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,800
The investigation was botched.

180
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,950
Give me your hand, man.

181
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,440
I want you to listen to me, Barry,
because I mean this.

182
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,478
I want you to give all that up.

183
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,319
And I want you to stop coming
to see me.

184
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,758
I am a drag on your life.

185
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,439
Please don't ever say that
to me again.

186
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,710
Please?

187
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,395
You can be whatever you want to be.
You're brilliant, man.

188
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,036
Absolute best of the best.

189
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,279
I can't sit here

190
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,075
and watch you run in place
in Central City

191
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,031
for some old dude
who is not going anywhere.

192
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,635
- Dad, that's not true. That's not true.
- It's time.

193
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,314
Let's go, Allen. Allen!

194
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,960
I want you to make your own future.

195
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,072
You're living in the past.
Make your own future.

196
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,550
Open gate.

197
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,959
Lab's all yours, Howard.

198
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,919
11:30. Early night for you, Silas.

199
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,840
Yes. Early.

200
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,398
I never got to say...

201
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,591
I'm very sorry about what happened.

202
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,477
Victor was a wonderful kid.

203
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,590
Thank you.

204
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,310
Victor.

205
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,399
Victor, you're not stuck up here.

206
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,079
You can have a life.
You can have more than...

207
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,354
If you stay up here brooding...

208
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,430
I'm processing.

209
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,071
I can access everything.

210
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,915
But I can't put it all together.

211
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,960
Not yet. But if you worked with me,
if we had the change engine...

212
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,318
So you'd do to someone else
what you did to me.

213
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,470
No.

214
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,711
The box stays hidden.

215
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,714
If you could see what we're learning
from the Kryptonian ship...

216
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,594
I think the change engine
could integrate with its energy,

217
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,830
get it powered up and...

218
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,116
Does anybody know?

219
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,190
What?

220
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,953
At the lab.

221
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,190
Does anybody know I'm alive?

222
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,273
- I didn't think you were ready for...
- To what?

223
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,639
For them to see the monster?

224
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,755
You are not a monster.

225
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,634
It's weird that you thought
I meant me.

226
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,274
What I did...

227
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,559
I lost your mother in that accident.

228
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,475
I wasn't about to...

229
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,274
I couldn't bear to lose my son.

230
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,079
But you did.

231
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,311
I got a language in my head
that I don't speak.

232
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,197
It's not just digital. It's alien.

233
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,200
Every day, I wake up different.

234
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,440
Modified.

235
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,710
How do you...

236
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,993
Couldn't do that last night.

237
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,276
Ever since we got visitors
from Krypton

238
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,080
people have been waiting
for the next alien invasion.

239
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,477
Now I gotta wonder if I'm it.

240
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,229
Any changes today?

241
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,914
No, my Queen.

242
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,950
The Mother Box has awoken,
yet nothing has happened.

243
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,393
It has slept for thousands of years
since the First Age.

244
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,153
Why did it wake at all?

245
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,872
Amazons! On your mark!

246
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,795
Yes, soldiers! Fight on!

247
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,320
Ready!

248
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,429
Steppenwolf.

249
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,160
Mother.

250
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,280
Millennia in exile, searching...

251
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,036
At last you call me home.

252
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,157
You will not
like your welcome.

253
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,160
Oh, I think I will.

254
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,230
Steady!

255
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,790
Forward!

256
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,436
Gather the legions!

257
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,040
You must seal the cage!

258
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,998
Go!

259
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,680
Flank right!

260
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,750
Yes.

261
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,510
Run.

262
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,870
Seal the gates!

263
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,154
Keep it moving.

264
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,114
Got it! Go!

265
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,314
Enough.

266
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,751
Noble Queen, why do you fight?

267
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,679
After the unity,
you will join my legion

268
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,231
and you will know the righteousness
of power.

269
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,195
You will love me.

270
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,956
You all will.

271
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,071
We have to light
the ancient warning fire.

272
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,072
The fire has not burned
for 5,000 years.

273
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,879
Men won't know what it means.

274
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,394
Men won't.

275
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,640
She will.

276
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,753
Listen to me, Diana.

277
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,551
What did you do
this weekend, Diana?

278
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,313
- Me?
- Yeah.

279
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,352
Nothing very interesting.

280
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,393
That's all you ever tell us.

281
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,711
What can I say,
I'm not that exciting.

282
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,996
<i>So-called shrine of the Amazons,</i>

283
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,870
<i>an enormous bonfire burned
right behind me</i>

284
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:07,557
<i>baffling absolutely everyone from locals
to government authorities alike.</i>

285
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,709
<i>The fire could be seen
for miles on end.</i>

286
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,599
Invasion.

287
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,196
<i>On the local scene this janitor's wife
had some strong words</i>

288
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,910
<i>for the aliens she says
stole her man.</i>

289
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,750
<i>My Howard is a good man.
He's a provider.</i>

290
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,275
<i>And these aliens are gonna
f****** probe him?</i>

291
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,680
<i>Come down to the Lakeview</i>

292
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,311
<i>and I'll stick a f****** probe
up your alien a**. You...</i>

293
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,558
I found a little place.
By the diner.

294
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,154
Suits me just fine.

295
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,794
I wish you'd said something.

296
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,077
Oh, no.
I got behind in the payments.

297
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:47,559
And you know the banks jump like
a cougar if you miss by a dime.

298
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,797
Place was too big for me anyway.

299
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,997
Shuffling around like an old ghost.

300
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,999
Well, I might've been able
to talk to someone, or...

301
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,830
You had enough to deal with. Don't need
to add mother-in-law to the list.

302
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,870
Not that I was ever...

303
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,560
Hey, Lane.

304
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,152
Who was your source,
the activist in that university?

305
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,080
Well, it's my source.

306
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,835
I got tapped for the kidnapping story.

307
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,232
There were all those student protests.
Anyway, I'm thinking it's political.

308
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,272
So, who's your guy?

309
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,437
Well, I'll see if she'll take your call.

310
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,155
So it's a she.

311
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,834
It's not a she.

312
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,191
Sounds like you should be working
that story.

313
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,116
I'm...

314
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,919
I'm not ready yet.

315
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,550
I'm perfectly happy doing fluff pieces

316
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,518
about kitten grooming.

317
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,240
For a while.

318
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,314
It was hard coming back
here at all.

319
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,354
Well, I can hardly read the news
anyway.

320
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,239
So much bitterness.

321
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,349
Of course I think it's all
because he's gone.

322
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,992
But I suppose a mother does.

323
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,839
But it's not like there's any less
that needs reporting.

324
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,754
And Clark promised me you were
gonna bring home another Pulitzer.

325
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,910
Oh, did he?

326
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,275
Oh, yes. He did.

327
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,717
He said that you were the thirstiest
young woman that he'd ever met.

328
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,115
Hungriest.

329
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,832
Yeah.

330
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:22,238
He said you could smell a story
further away than he could hear.

331
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,150
Well, stories just made sense.

332
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,117
It was more than just a puzzle.
It was about the truth.

333
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:37,113
It was about seeing the engine
of the world.

334
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,632
When it still ran.

335
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,074
<i>Victor Stone. Deceased.</i>

336
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,796
That one.

337
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,911
Pretty sure that's what made
the alien go crazy.

338
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,157
<i>I'll see about rigging something
for the suit.</i>

339
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,390
<i>Won't be quick.</i>

340
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,313
Anything that can give me an edge.

341
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,392
You know, I paid millions of dollars
for this building's security.

342
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,115
Yeah, it looked expensive.

343
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,796
Hi.

344
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,429
A new toy?

345
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,478
Prototype troop carrier.

346
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,632
I once knew a man
who would have loved to fly it.

347
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,950
Yeah.

348
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,834
We're gonna need more than a pilot.

349
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,880
I think there's an attack coming.

350
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,400
Not coming, Bruce.

351
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,112
It's already here.

352
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,837
<i>They called him Steppenwolf,
the end of worlds.</i>

353
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,958
<i>He lived only to conquer.</i>

354
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,239
<i>Millions fell before his blade,</i>

355
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,750
<i>or rose again as his Parademons.</i>

356
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,355
<i>Nightmare creatures who feed on fear.</i>

357
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,640
Yeah, I think I met one.

358
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,200
We didn't hit it off.

359
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,396
Here in Gotham?

360
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,640
They're all over.
They're looking for his boxes?

361
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,154
The Mother Boxes.

362
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,589
Mother Boxes.

363
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,592
I guess Steppenwolf took the one
your people were guarding.

364
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,399
That leaves two more.

365
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,676
I'm impressed.

366
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,832
Don't be.
I have no idea what's in them.

367
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,878
A weapon? Some kind of power?

368
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,952
They don't contain power.

369
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,396
They are power.

370
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,676
<i>Carried from planet to planet,</i>

371
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,958
<i>the Mother Boxes combine
to form the unity.</i>

372
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,750
<i>An apocalyptic power
that not only destroys worlds,</i>

373
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,118
<i>but transforms them
into the primordial hellscape</i>

374
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,158
<i>of Steppenwolf's birth world.</i>

375
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,599
<i>We should have died.</i>

376
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,956
<i>But we formed our own unity.</i>

377
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,075
<i>Amazons, Atlanteans,</i>

378
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:41,075
<i>all the tribes of men
fought side by side.</i>

379
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,436
<i>Warriors of legend,</i>

380
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,518
<i>allies from other worlds,</i>

381
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,478
<i>even the gods themselves
all acted as one.</i>

382
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,358
<i>Laying down their lives
to drive Steppenwolf away.</i>

383
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,597
<i>Some say it drove him mad.</i>

384
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,434
<i>The disgrace of his first retreat.</i>

385
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,195
<i>He swore our alliance would crumble.</i>

386
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,159
<i>That darkness would cover the Earth.</i>

387
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,678
<i>And that he would return when it did.</i>

388
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,715
<i>Left behind,</i>

389
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,152
<i>the Mother Boxes were too dangerous
to be kept together.</i>

390
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,479
<i>One was entrusted to the Amazons.</i>

391
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,033
<i>One to the Atlanteans.</i>

392
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:49,959
<i>Both sealed and guarded
in secure strongholds.</i>

393
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,231
<i>The Box of Men was buried in secret</i>

394
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,033
<i>so that no tribe would be tempted
to use its power over another.</i>

395
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,798
Such harmony out of such horror.

396
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,316
It was truly an Age of Heroes.

397
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,918
Something tells me we're not getting
the band back together.

398
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,151
The Atlanteans were forced undersea,

399
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,994
and the Amazons to an island
they can never leave.

400
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,272
Well, I wouldn't count on
the tribes of men.

401
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,035
We tend to act like the Doomsday Clock
has a snooze button.

402
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,919
- How long until...
- Days.

403
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,920
At most.

404
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,634
Steppenwolf's mistake last time
was attacking us.

405
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,269
He wanted to make the Earth kneel
before he destroyed us.

406
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,199
This time he'll just go after the boxes.

407
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,790
I got a location for
one of our recruits. Barry Allen.

408
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,595
What about the other one?
Victor Stone?

409
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,075
I was hoping you would dig him up.

410
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,756
We're asking people we don't know
to risk their lives.

411
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,116
I know.

412
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,239
That's how this works.

413
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,675
Barry Allen, Bruce Wayne.

414
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,233
You said that like it explains

415
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,790
why there's a total stranger
in my place

416
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,310
sitting in the dark
in my second favorite chair.

417
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,993
Tell me about this.

418
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,433
This is a person who looks exactly
like me, but who is definitely not me.

419
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,996
Very attractive Jewish boy.

420
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,759
Somebody who, I don't know,
stole your pocket watch?

421
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,798
Or railroads?

422
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,878
I know you have abilities.

423
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,111
I just don't know what they are.

424
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,915
My special skills include viola,

425
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,993
web design, fluent in
sign language...

426
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,190
Gorilla sign language.

427
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,593
Silica-based quartz sand fabric,
abrasion resistant, heat resistant.

428
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,797
Yeah, I do competitive ice dancing.

429
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,514
It's what they use on
the space shuttle

430
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,478
to prevent it from burning up
on reentry.

431
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,075
I do very competitive ice dancing.

432
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,115
Whoever you're looking for,
it's not me.

433
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,710
You're the Batman?

434
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,354
So, you're fast.

435
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,959
That feels like an oversimplification.

436
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,636
I'm putting together a team.
People with special abilities.

437
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,359
You see, I believe enemies are coming.

438
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,273
Stop right there. I'm in.

439
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,599
- You are?
- Yeah...

440
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,953
I need friends.

441
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,752
People are difficult.
They require a lot of focus. They...

442
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,719
They have like a rhythm that
I haven't quite been able to...

443
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,870
Like brunch!

444
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,679
Like, what is brunch?

445
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,356
You wait in line for an hour
for, essentially, lunch.

446
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,840
I mean...

447
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,835
I don't know.

448
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,552
People are a little slow.

449
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,720
I'll try to keep up.

450
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,473
Can I keep this?

451
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,989
It's like this layer
of dimensional reality,

452
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,230
and it seems to manipulate
space-time.

453
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,720
I call it the Speed Force.

454
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,639
Causes me to burn
a tremendous amount of calories.

455
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,435
So I'm just a black hole of snacks.

456
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,353
I am a snack hole.

457
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,239
How many people
are on this special fight team?

458
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,039
Three, including you.

459
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,953
Three? Against what?

460
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,200
I'll tell you on the plane.

461
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,794
The plane?

462
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,199
What are your superpowers again?

463
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,200
I'm rich.

464
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,156
The program always gets twitchy
with this footage.

465
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,720
You know who we are.

466
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,955
Are you Victor Stone?

467
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,115
I need to speak to you.

468
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,959
No. Face-to-face.

469
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,634
I'm old-fashioned that way.

470
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,556
If I was going to attack you,
I would have done it by the lake.

471
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,993
Looks like you have a date,
Ms. Prince.

472
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,360
About time somebody here did.

473
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,234
Face-to-face.

474
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,759
I've been doing some tracking.

475
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,358
What you're looking for
is sticking to the dead zones.

476
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,234
If it gets in front of a camera,
causes a surge...

477
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,150
I'll let you know.

478
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,390
That's not good enough.

479
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,353
Not good enough?

480
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,874
For you.

481
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,270
Look, I don't know you, and I don't know
how you got these gifts.

482
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,590
Gifts?

483
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,513
No one else can do what you do.

484
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,996
If these are gifts,

485
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,753
then why am I the one paying for them?

486
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,433
We need you, Victor.

487
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,274
And maybe you need us.

488
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,554
I do fine alone.

489
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,554
I told myself the same
for a long time.

490
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,110
I lost someone I loved once.

491
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,277
I shut myself off...

492
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,396
from everyone.

493
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,670
But I had to learn
to open back up again.

494
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,354
The truth is I'm still working on it.

495
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,433
And if you agreed to meet me,

496
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,317
you're working on it too.

497
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,790
Trust me, Victor.

498
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,551
Mayday! Mayday!

499
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,157
Something came down from the sky!

500
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,549
<i>Cortlandt, you're cutting out.</i>

501
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,790
Please help me!

502
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,840
Whiskey.

503
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,840
And one for Ahab, there.

504
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,314
From the sky.

505
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,232
I... I heard a cannon.

506
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,629
To ocean's rage.

507
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,830
They came.

508
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,396
Monsters from the sky.

509
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,152
Tore right through my boat.

510
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,109
Monsters.

511
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,036
It's on him.

512
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,793
You took a hell of a hit.

513
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,390
You all right?

514
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,914
At last.

515
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,430
The firstborn of beloved
Queen Atlanna.

516
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,830
Wait.

517
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,830
Please.

518
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,990
I knew her.

519
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,554
Well, that makes one of us.

520
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,313
When my parents fought in the wars

521
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,630
she took me in.

522
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,790
What a saint.

523
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,713
You dare speak
of Queen Atlanna that way?

524
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,792
Your Queen left me
on my father's doorstep

525
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:06,950
and never gave me another thought.

526
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,236
Your mother left you
to save your life.

527
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,110
Cannot imagine how it hurt her.

528
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,714
What it cost her.

529
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,393
But you're not a defenseless
child now.

530
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,919
It would have been
her responsibility

531
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,914
to follow that monster
to the surface and stop it.

532
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,470
Now,

533
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,590
it's yours.

534
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,600
Then I'm gonna need something
from you.

535
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,152
<i>I see, Mother.</i>

536
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,750
<i>I see why you waited to summon me.</i>

537
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,475
<i>The Kryptonian's death plunged
this timid world into such terror.</i>

538
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,075
<i>Amazons, Atlanteans,</i>

539
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,280
<i>each stands and falls alone.</i>

540
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,550
I know, Mother,
you've waited too long for the unity.

541
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,719
I know. But you will feed.

542
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:09,430
And my exile will come to an end.

543
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:13,640
I will take my place among
the New Gods.

544
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,553
Find the last one!

545
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,437
Its power will cleanse this world.

546
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,679
For the unity!

547
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,953
For Darkseid.

548
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,837
Oh, Victor.

549
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,989
Asshole!

550
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,755
Eight kidnappings.
Six in Metropolis, two here.

551
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,116
All the vics work for S.T.A.R. Labs.

552
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,715
Attacked by a flying vampire.

553
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:05,070
Suspect was a giant bat
with huge fangs.

554
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,640
One of them was a little kid.

555
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,917
Scared.
Won't say a word but drew this.

556
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,231
- Looks like...
- I know what it looks like.

557
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,236
Come on, you think he fights criminals
for 20 years here

558
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,518
and then he goes to Metropolis
and kidnaps eight people?

559
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,999
I'll talk to him tonight.

560
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,592
World's gone crazy, Jim.

561
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,717
Maybe he did too.

562
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,989
Did you find the cyborg?

563
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,959
We spoke.

564
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,514
Give him time.

565
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,359
You must be Barry. I'm Diana.

566
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,000
Hi, Barry, I'm Diana.

567
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,396
That's not right. Great.

568
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,472
- So this is us?
- Yeah, this is us.

569
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,394
Awesome!

570
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,358
That's the Bat-Signal!
That's your...

571
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,193
Sorry. That's your signal.

572
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,396
That means we have to go now.

573
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,153
Yeah, that's...
that's what that means.

574
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,755
It's so cool.

575
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,720
How many of you are there?

576
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,959
Not enough.

577
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,316
Eight people abducted from
or near S.T.A.R. Labs.

578
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,639
Here's the potential perp.

579
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,520
Parademons.

580
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,194
Okay.

581
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,312
The demons must have
caught the scent of the Mother Box.

582
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:48,120
They carried people away to find out
what they know.

583
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,919
- So the eight may still be alive.
- Nine.

584
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,591
The head of S.T.A.R. Labs
was taken as well.

585
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,836
You made it.

586
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,515
So then, there must be
a nest nearby.

587
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,872
I plotted all the sightings
in Metropolis, Gotham.

588
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,753
No pattern I can see.

589
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,110
The lines on the map
don't converge.

590
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,555
On land.

591
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,155
These lead back to Braxton Island
between the two cities.

592
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,436
Gotham Harbor.

593
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,795
These are air vents.

594
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,156
They all lead down to the tunnel for
Metropolis Project

595
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,112
that was abandoned in '29.

596
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,359
Do you really think that...

597
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,599
Oh, wow. They just...
They really just vanish.

598
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,680
That's rude.

599
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,757
- Where are we, Alfred?
- Braxton Island.

600
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,352
You should be directly under
the venting tower for the tunnel.

601
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,433
Now look to your left,
you should see a staircase.

602
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,677
It'll give you access
to the machine room.

603
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,639
Define access.

604
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,597
One at a time.
The bridge may not...

605
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,510
Hold.

606
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,315
Just tell me the truth.

607
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:34,040
Please, just let us go.
I have a family.

608
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,429
Wrong answer.

609
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:37,955
Humans.

610
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:42,399
The stench of your fear
is making my soldiers hungry.

611
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,358
Shall I feed them?

612
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,551
You've been near the Mother Box.
Her scent is on you.

613
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,030
Please. We have families.

614
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,556
Why does everyone keep
telling me that?

615
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,712
Please, please.

616
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,190
I don't need to hurt you...

617
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,955
Right. Okay, yeah.
Here's the thing...

618
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:07,479
See, I'm afraid of bugs and
guns and obnoxiously tall people.

619
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,831
And murder.
And I can't be here.

620
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,152
It's really cool you guys seem ready
to do battle and stuff,

621
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,789
but full transparency,
I've never done battle.

622
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,276
I've just pushed some people
and run away.

623
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,354
Save one.

624
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,510
What?

625
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,074
Save one person.

626
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:25,751
Which one?

627
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,032
Don't talk, don't fight.
Get in, get one out.

628
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,469
And then?

629
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,160
You'll know.

630
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,110
Okay.

631
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,833
Useless.

632
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,799
You then.

633
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,559
Where is my Mother Box?

634
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,953
I'll die before I tell you.

635
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,432
At last, one that doesn't whine.

636
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,434
But you will scream.

637
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,310
Dad.

638
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,230
Victor.

639
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,791
You were born of her.

640
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,472
A creature of chaos.

641
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,150
Not how I see it.

642
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,033
Give it time.

643
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,078
Amazon!

644
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,997
Okay.

645
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,072
Save one. Save one.

646
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,833
This one is mine.

647
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,951
You overestimate yourself.

648
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:05,997
Child, my ax is still slick
with the blood of your sisters.

649
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,079
Alfred, I need the Knightcrawler.

650
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,913
Thought you'd never ask.

651
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,436
Crawler's on the way.
Initiating remote mode.

652
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,680
Okay, you good?

653
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,480
At the end of the hall,
there should be stairs. Go!

654
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,597
He's after the change engine.
His Mother Box.

655
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,790
You have to keep him from it.

656
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,560
- Help people get to safety. Go!
- Promise me!

657
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,516
Finish her!

658
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,480
Sorry, guys.

659
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,319
I didn't bring a sword.

660
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,074
Jesus. He is tall.

661
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,430
Oh, fuck.

662
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:06,513
So, you have the blood of the Old Gods
in you.

663
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,118
The Old Gods died.

664
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,835
No!

665
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,554
Heads up.

666
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,840
Thanks, Alfred,
but I'll take it from here.

667
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,072
Do I know you?

668
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,919
Primitive beings.

669
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,279
What are we under right now?

670
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,440
Gotham Harbor.

671
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,310
You all need to move.

672
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,390
You get him out.

673
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,550
Diana, there's no time.

674
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,752
Also among my fears is drowning.

675
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,031
You are a distraction.

676
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,757
Mother is calling.

677
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:49,909
Diana, come on!

678
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:22,196
Oh, come on.

679
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,440
The change engine.

680
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,439
Did he just bail?

681
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,400
Millions in structural damage.
You haven't lost your touch.

682
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:58,394
But it's good to see you
playing well with others.

683
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,792
Dressed like a bat.

684
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,076
I dig it.

685
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,230
May be temporary.

686
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,671
So, what made you change your mind?

687
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:11,910
Steppenwolf.

688
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,360
He took the Mother Box from Atlantis.

689
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,435
All he needs now is the
lost Box of Men.

690
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,795
If he doesn't already have it.

691
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,674
He doesn't have it.

692
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,791
Wow! It's like a cave.

693
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,317
Like a Batcave.

694
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,630
Barry.

695
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,111
My father called it
a change engine.

696
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,795
It was found by the British
during World War I.

697
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:33,158
They studied it, but they
couldn't even date it, it's so old.

698
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,516
It was shelved till
the night Superman died.

699
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,751
Then she lit up like Christmas.

700
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:40,956
They brought it to S.T.A.R. Labs

701
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:44,477
where my father recognized it
as a perpetual energy matrix.

702
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,633
Oh, that sounds cool.
I thought it was like a nuclear bomb.

703
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,916
A Mother Box destroys as it creates.

704
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,714
It's a cycle of life,
but a million times faster.

705
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,949
My father thought it was
the key to unlimited energy.

706
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,475
New formulas.

707
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:01,077
Cellular regeneration.

708
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,078
But it's too volatile to control.

709
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:04,799
He used it on you.

710
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,238
I was in an accident.

711
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,596
Should've died.

712
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,275
My father thought
that he could use the Mother Box

713
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:15,399
to rebuild the broken parts of me
with a few cybernetic enhancements.

714
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,592
Instead, he built a living machine

715
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,792
that may be stronger than its host.

716
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,076
Too much.

717
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:22,955
Too much life.

718
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,559
What's on your weird mind?

719
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:30,670
Muscles, coordination,
basic cellular integrity.

720
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,991
A human being can only absorb
so much.

721
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:37,193
The Mother Box was designed
to reshape a planet.

722
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:38,550
So?

723
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,633
So, what if you were stronger
than a planet?

724
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:46,320
Your cells lying dormant,
but incapable of decay.

725
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,918
If you were in a conductive field,

726
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,153
a boost from the Mother Box...

727
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,437
Could bring him back to life.

728
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:59,037
The Kryptonian ship has an amniotic
chamber, which would be a perfect...

729
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,150
No.

730
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,754
- Diana.
- Bruce, no.

731
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,389
You have no idea what kind of power
you are dealing with.

732
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,040
Even if there's a fraction
of a chance?

733
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,760
That what? That we could raise a monster
like Luthor did?

734
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,320
We have tech Luthor's never even seen.

735
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,153
Superman is dead.

736
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:14,674
We all wish he weren't.

737
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,433
We don't know what state he's in.

738
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,432
We know we can't bring him back.

739
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:21,195
But this is science beyond our limits.

740
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,113
And that's what science is for.
To do what's never been done.

741
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,316
To make life better.

742
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,675
Or to end it.

743
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,634
Technology is like any other power.

744
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:31,231
Without reason, without heart,
it destroys us.

745
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,073
You're risking lives.

746
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,480
Theirs and maybe countless more.

747
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,030
We don't have time for
a control group.

748
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,873
Is it a risk? Yes.
But it's necessary.

749
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:42,594
Why, because of your guilt?

750
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,957
Bruce, I was there.

751
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,839
You didn't kill Superman.

752
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,915
At some point, even you have to learn
to move on.

753
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,438
Steve Trevor tell you that?

754
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:11,152
Superman was a beacon
to the world.

755
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:13,760
Why aren't you?

756
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,432
You're an inspiration, Diana.

757
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,393
You don't just save people,

758
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,512
you make them see their
better selves.

759
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,119
And yet, I'd never heard of you

760
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:28,877
until Luthor lured you out by stealing
a picture of your dead boyfriend.

761
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:36,070
You shut yourself down for a century,
so let's not talk about me moving on.

762
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,151
You know that if she kills you,
we'll cover for her.

763
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,118
We are not enough!

764
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:44,993
Each of us, in our own way,
is held back.

765
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:47,595
And I promise you, Steppenwolf is not
out there talking about ethics.

766
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,355
He's trying to burn down the world!

767
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:53,792
The way we're gonna stop him
is by using his power,

768
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:56,953
this power, against him.

769
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,035
I agree.

770
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,999
I don't like the idea of reintegrating
with the Mother Box,

771
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,231
but I was running the numbers
while you were being an asshole

772
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,750
and there is a high probability
that we can bring him back.

773
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:11,992
Right, right. But we mean bring him back
in like a, yay, he's back, way...

774
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:16,473
not in like a Pet Sematary
scenario.

775
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,199
You lose something when you die.

776
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,599
Even Superman.

777
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:22,399
Maybe not his mind.

778
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:23,914
Maybe his soul.

779
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,040
I'll have a contingency plan
for that.

780
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,669
If he wakes up
and you're the first thing he sees,

781
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,834
you'll need one.

782
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,192
Well, that was fun while
it didn't last.

783
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:48,000
She could've stopped me.
I practically dared her to.

784
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,117
I don't see why you're pushing her.

785
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,400
We have to boost the signal.

786
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:54,960
Put it through the Batmobile
speakers.

787
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,349
Yeah, now you're changing
the subject.

788
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:57,954
I have a contingency.

789
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,952
Diana was right about the risk.

790
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,880
If the plan goes south,
we're gonna bring in the big guns.

791
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,440
But that's not...

792
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,757
Those are very big guns.

793
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,110
You've got a team here.

794
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:10,715
Superman would bring this team together
better than I ever could.

795
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,196
- His strength...
- It doesn't matter how strong you are.

796
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,880
Or what abilities you might have...

797
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,633
He was more human than I am.

798
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:22,800
He lived in this world.

799
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,435
Fell in love. Had a job.

800
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,194
Despite all that power.

801
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:31,793
The world needs Superman.

802
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,072
And the team needs Clark.

803
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,879
And what does Clark need?

804
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,959
Maybe he's at peace.

805
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,314
He'll get over it.

806
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,277
You know, I could do this
a lot faster. I just...

807
01:07:58,440 --> 01:07:59,840
Is it weird that it feels
disrespectful?

808
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:01,755
Yep.

809
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,237
Do you feel a sense of confidence

810
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:09,360
that we're not doing something
horribly wrong and macabre here?

811
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:10,996
Not really.

812
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:14,120
- Okay, then why...
- Because I saw Steppenwolf up close.

813
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:18,036
The stories Diana told us.
I believe them.

814
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,433
But we gotta stop him.

815
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:21,875
That's the plan.

816
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,195
That's the plan.

817
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:29,517
Okay. We're not ready for...

818
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:31,751
racially charged...

819
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,479
You got struck by lightning, huh?

820
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,879
Yeah, that's the abridged version.

821
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,191
- And you...
- Explosion.

822
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:42,555
Woke up in a lab.

823
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,154
So we're the accidents.

824
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,035
Yeah, that's us.

825
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,355
Hey. No, no.

826
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:04,512
We're approaching
the Kryptonian ship.

827
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:06,399
ETA 30 seconds.

828
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:13,799
I'm here for him.

829
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,111
- I swear I would never...
- Save it.

830
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,593
- Okay.
- Okay.

831
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:41,310
Okay.

832
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,159
This is amazing.

833
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:06,595
This is crazy.

834
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,632
Oh, what, now it's crazy?

835
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,556
You lunatics better know
what you're doing.

836
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,476
<i>Welcome.</i>

837
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:07,478
Lex Luthor fried the circuits
bringing his creature to life.

838
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,672
There's not enough charge
to wake the box.

839
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,553
I might be able to do it.

840
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:14,396
I might be able to jump-start it.

841
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:15,550
If I can get enough distance,

842
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:17,552
I can conduct
a significant electrical current.

843
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,478
I might be able to wake the box.

844
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,395
- If that's still what we want.
- We have to try.

845
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:29,999
This must be the end of the line.

846
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,435
So, I'm in position.

847
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,110
The Mother Box is ready.

848
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,710
You have to charge it
the moment it touches the fluid.

849
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:40,720
- Five.
- Five.

850
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:43,515
Diana's right. This is a bad idea.

851
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:45,634
- Four.
- Four.

852
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,033
- Three.
- Three.

853
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:50,515
Two.

854
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:52,674
Two.

855
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:54,350
One.

856
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,714
He's back.

857
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:58,029
<i>Dispatch, this is 3-Adam-1-6.
Backing up Code Three.</i>

858
01:13:58,240 --> 01:13:59,390
<i>I'm currently two minutes out.</i>

859
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,030
He's not all right.

860
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:05,916
<i>Copy that.</i>

861
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,315
He's scanning us.

862
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,470
What?

863
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,518
Arthur, you need to relax.
Your adrenaline's spiking.

864
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:13,955
Because he's not all right.

865
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:15,110
Oh, no.

866
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:18,039
Should we bow? Or show our bellies?

867
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,679
Victor? Victor!

868
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:24,720
- Shit!
- What are you doing?

869
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:26,911
- It's my armor's defense system.
- No!

870
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,151
It's stronger since the interface.
I can't control it.

871
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,509
- Victor, no!
- Victor!

872
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,438
Just think
happy thoughts, Victor.

873
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:33,954
Go to a happier place.

874
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:46,590
Kal-El, no!

875
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,196
He's confused.
He doesn't know who he is.

876
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:58,990
Pet Sematary.

877
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,276
Arthur, we need to restrain him.

878
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,429
I got him.

879
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:34,672
Kal-El, the last son of Krypton.

880
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:38,317
Remember who you are.

881
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,793
Tell me who you...

882
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:39,830
Clark.

883
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:45,800
I know you.

884
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,318
Please don't make me do this.

885
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:17,472
Alfred, I need the big gun...

886
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,633
You did this.

887
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,154
I had to.

888
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:28,558
You won't let me live.

889
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,478
You won't let me die.

890
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:33,597
The world needs you.

891
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:40,158
But does it need you?

892
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:42,830
Tell me.

893
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:46,800
Do you bleed?

894
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:49,836
Clark?

895
01:17:58,640 --> 01:17:59,710
Clark.

896
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:02,430
Please.

897
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:22,670
Please.

898
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:31,196
Please.

899
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:33,276
Just go.

900
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:35,196
Yeah.

901
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:37,476
Let's go.

902
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:52,471
Yeah, something is definitely bleeding.

903
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:13,790
The Mother Box.

904
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:17,160
He has the last one.

905
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:33,640
You brought us here.

906
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:36,196
You remembered.

907
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,475
This is home.

908
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,190
You smell good.

909
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:49,515
Did I not before?

910
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:06,310
Don't do that.

911
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,473
We just got our asses
handed to us.

912
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,558
And Steppenwolf has got
the third box.

913
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,439
So we find them.

914
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,798
If the boxes are even close
to each other,

915
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:18,032
there is going to be
some kind of energy surge.

916
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:19,316
Steppenwolf's gonna
be keeping them

917
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:20,470
somewhere where they don't read.

918
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,359
No internet, no satellite coverage.

919
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,677
- Well, that narrows it down.
- Not enough.

920
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:26,590
So, you can't find them.

921
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:28,514
Or maybe you don't want to.

922
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:33,030
Arthur.

923
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,713
Yeah, that was a great way
to get rid of Superman.

924
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,996
Man, I'm not doing this on purpose.

925
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,952
Right. 'Cause you can't control
the machine.

926
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,439
So is this a bad time
to bring up my blood sugar?

927
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:47,036
Very hungry.

928
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,400
Victor.

929
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,993
You can find the boxes.
You share their energy.

930
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,956
I know it's frightening,
but if you go under,

931
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,760
I promise, we will pull you
back out.

932
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:06,039
Just keep the little merman away
from me while I work.

933
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:11,592
Barry, go find Alfred in the pantry.

934
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:15,356
When you come back, get online.
Everybody checks everybody else's work.

935
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:17,715
Listen.

936
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:21,635
I was wondering if you could
put out a, you know, a feeler.

937
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,836
Like, aquatic. You know.

938
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,231
I don't know...
Do you talk to fish?

939
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:32,475
The water does the talking.

940
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:34,554
Of course.

941
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:37,149
If the current comes in strange,
it might point the way.

942
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,396
Okay.

943
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:03,150
Wait.

944
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,110
Let me.

945
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,833
It's just a little out of place.

946
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:13,592
So, Clark seemed to share
your view on being woken up.

947
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,080
He could've killed you.

948
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:17,552
I was willing to make the trade.

949
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:21,597
And bringing in Lois Lane?

950
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:23,831
Remember what you told me
about heart in the hangar?

951
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,149
I bet you...

952
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:26,833
thought I wasn't listening.

953
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:28,989
Thank you.

954
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,830
You know you can't do this forever.

955
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,116
I can barely do it now.

956
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:38,275
Steppenwolf.

957
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,030
This is the job.

958
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:41,236
It's my job.

959
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:44,955
And I haven't been doing it.
I've been reacting.

960
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,354
Not leading.

961
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,713
You know, what you said
about Steve Trevor...

962
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:53,599
It wasn't my business. I'm sorry.

963
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:58,075
You were pushing me to lead
the team,

964
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:00,440
but leaders get people killed.

965
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:04,231
I fought always

966
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:06,595
when I was needed.

967
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:11,674
But to lead, to step into the light
and to say to people,

968
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,399
this is worth your life.

969
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:16,994
When it's your fault...

970
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:21,153
They're all Steve Trevor.

971
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:27,231
We make it through tonight,
you can stay in the shadows forever.

972
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,480
Dress up like a bat.

973
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:31,676
I won't even sue.

974
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,270
If we get through the night.

975
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:57,360
Are you okay?

976
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,639
You brought us here, but you've
hardly spent a minute in the house.

977
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,679
I know. It's...

978
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,158
I just got out of a wooden box.

979
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,280
What was it like?

980
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,150
Coming back?

981
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:21,390
Itchy.

982
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,680
I mean, honestly,

983
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:27,911
weird in so many ways.

984
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:30,674
But mostly just...

985
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,433
I wasn't strong.

986
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:37,153
I didn't...

987
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:40,152
You would've been
very disappointed in me.

988
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:45,754
I wasn't Lois Lane,
the dedicated reporter. I just...

989
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:48,315
It's okay.

990
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:52,799
I'm the idiot who left.

991
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:55,719
But I'm back now.

992
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,118
And I'm gonna make things right.

993
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,400
You called Mom.

994
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:22,790
Of course.

995
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:24,110
Thank you.

996
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:30,754
I was hoping it was gonna take you
longer to recover.

997
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,070
Why?

998
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:37,432
Because now I have to send you away.

999
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:40,640
Bruce.

1000
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,473
He needs you.

1001
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:45,718
Fate of the world, I think that's
the deal. He was pretty tense.

1002
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:49,359
Well, I guess I do owe him one.

1003
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,556
Right.

1004
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,234
But no dying.

1005
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,914
And I get the exclusive.

1006
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,319
Yes, ma'am.

1007
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:35,709
Are you really you?

1008
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:37,393
I'm really me, Ma.

1009
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:50,634
At last.

1010
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:55,116
Praise to the unity!

1011
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:59,837
The three as one!

1012
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:30,712
Praise to the mother of horrors.

1013
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:41,715
Is Steppenwolf there?

1014
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:43,599
Just a minute.

1015
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:45,590
Sorry.

1016
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:47,992
It's Pozharnov in northern Russia.

1017
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:49,515
The nuclear plant.

1018
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:51,433
Had a meltdown 30 years ago.

1019
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:53,199
There have been some attempts
to resettle nearby.

1020
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:55,960
But it looks like really
rough sledding.

1021
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:59,320
Who picks this place to put
down roots?

1022
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,318
People that have been kicked out
of everywhere else.

1023
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:04,877
The Earth starts changing,
it will hit them first.

1024
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,510
- How long have we got?
- A few hours.

1025
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:09,793
Transport won't fly that fast.

1026
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:12,639
It will for me.

1027
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:56,872
The unity brings all three boxes
together in perfect sync.

1028
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,631
Its power builds
until it can't be contained.

1029
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:04,992
But if I can cause a delay between
each box, even for a nanosecond,

1030
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:07,629
its energy will cascade, form a loop.

1031
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,473
They'll feed on each other.

1032
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,000
And that's it?
We just pull them apart?

1033
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:12,879
No fuss, no muss.

1034
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:15,475
Separating the boxes
is still gonna cause a massive surge.

1035
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:16,795
I'll have to be there.

1036
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,838
But you guys should think about
getting clear.

1037
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:20,274
We're with you till it's done.

1038
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,556
Honestly, I think we're all
gonna be dead way before that.

1039
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:24,196
And you know what?

1040
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:26,955
I don't mind.
It's an honorable end.

1041
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:29,917
But we gotta shut Steppenwolf down.

1042
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,280
Superman's a no-show.

1043
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:34,317
You got no powers. No offense.

1044
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:37,154
This guy might be working for the enemy,
we don't know.

1045
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:39,277
You're tripping over your feet
and mine.

1046
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:42,556
You're gorgeous.

1047
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:45,519
And fierce, and strong, and...

1048
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,956
I know we went to war with the Amazons,
but that was before my time.

1049
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:50,589
And you know what?
I don't wanna die.

1050
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,792
I'm young.
There's shit that I want to do.

1051
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:57,197
I just feel like I didn't really
embrace the sea or the land.

1052
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:58,760
I've been a loner my whole life.

1053
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:01,753
But being part of something
bigger like this...

1054
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:06,432
Maybe I'm scared because
I'm meant to...

1055
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,080
I think that was beautiful.

1056
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:25,199
You say a word about this

1057
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:26,999
and you'll meet every piranha
I know.

1058
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:32,957
I honestly didn't hear anything after,
we're all gonna die.

1059
01:30:54,860 --> 01:30:57,154
Let them come.

1060
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:06,550
I'm going to take out that tower
and knock down that shield dome.

1061
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:08,595
You get to Steppenwolf.

1062
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:10,956
Don't wait for me, just do the job.

1063
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:17,071
All right, Alfred.
Are we set for broadcast?

1064
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:20,239
Playing all your favorite hits.

1065
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,674
Come on.
Follow me, you damn insects.

1066
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:44,874
They're coming.

1067
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:48,153
They're all coming.

1068
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:54,875
We might not have thought
this through.

1069
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:00,000
He's clearing the field.

1070
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:01,676
He won't last three minutes.

1071
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:03,476
Then let's use them.

1072
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:08,435
On my lead.

1073
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:22,516
<i>Critical damage.</i>

1074
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:26,032
Son of a bitch.

1075
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:30,680
Oh, snap!

1076
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:35,310
You're welcome.

1077
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:39,590
Yeah!

1078
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:41,080
This isn't the plan.

1079
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:42,514
No, Master Wayne.

1080
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:44,958
This is the team.

1081
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:46,594
Hey, blame the lady.

1082
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:48,831
We would've left you,
but she didn't ask for a vote.

1083
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:54,476
So, your genius move is dying?

1084
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:56,273
You really are out of your mind.

1085
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,472
I'm not the one who brought
a pitchfork.

1086
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:22,875
Ride ain't over yet.

1087
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:24,190
My man.

1088
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:11,672
Is this what conquering is?

1089
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,752
Hiding from the fight?

1090
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:15,314
Oh, no.

1091
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:17,914
You're all mine.

1092
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:25,714
- Thanks for the lift.
- Yeah, no problem.

1093
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:27,091
You got this?

1094
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:30,076
These things are gonna
keep coming.

1095
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:32,152
Okay. You get technical,
I'm on bug duty.

1096
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:33,356
Let's do it.

1097
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,913
Yes! That was gross!

1098
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:02,674
Thank you.

1099
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:05,390
This is...

1100
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:08,600
This is a lot.

1101
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:31,235
Now do you see it?

1102
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,555
Whatever
you're in the middle of,

1103
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:54,154
it's spreading for miles.

1104
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:57,074
Satellites show civilians
moving east.

1105
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:59,114
They're not gonna make it.

1106
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:00,316
Barry.

1107
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:02,552
I need you to take a walk.

1108
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:10,872
God, I hope this is east.

1109
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:59,991
You're not worthy to touch Mother.

1110
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:02,114
She's power,

1111
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:05,751
and power is the only law.

1112
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:14,399
You're all too weak to see
the truth.

1113
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:15,470
Well,

1114
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:19,360
I believe in truth.

1115
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:23,229
But I'm also a big fan of justice.

1116
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:32,316
All right.

1117
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:38,279
Kryptonian!

1118
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:56,836
So, how do I help?

1119
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,116
We buy him some time,

1120
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,471
he can stop that box
from destroying all life on Earth.

1121
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:02,910
We hope.

1122
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:05,675
Well, I knew you didn't bring me back
'cause you liked me.

1123
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:08,550
I don't not...

1124
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:15,954
- Civilians.
- Barry's headed...

1125
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:17,349
There's too many of them.

1126
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:27,270
Come on.

1127
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:43,834
Okay, this is definitely east.

1128
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:51,430
Slowpoke.

1129
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:53,440
Oh, it's on.

1130
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:54,955
I'll take the ones on the right.

1131
01:40:57,680 --> 01:40:58,716
It's okay...

1132
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:01,558
Hold on. Hold on. Yeah.

1133
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:20,955
Dostoevsky!

1134
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:40,596
Is this guy
still bothering you?

1135
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:55,430
Superman!

1136
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:57,159
We gotta pull these things apart.

1137
01:41:57,320 --> 01:41:59,789
A couple more seconds,
you'll see your opening.

1138
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:01,630
Any blowback?

1139
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:02,990
Big time.

1140
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:04,594
But I think we can take it.

1141
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,790
Good.

1142
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:08,637
'Cause I really like being alive.

1143
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:10,799
So do I.

1144
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:35,234
Clark.

1145
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:43,031
I take it back.

1146
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:44,600
I wanna die.

1147
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:51,359
Man, my toes hurt!

1148
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:54,399
I don't even understand the physics
of how my toes hurt.

1149
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:58,840
Children. I work with children.

1150
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:04,799
Have you guys seen
what's going on outside?

1151
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:17,830
I am the end of worlds!

1152
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:22,833
Who are you to defy me?

1153
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:26,918
This world is my right!

1154
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:49,953
No!

1155
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:51,674
This cannot be.

1156
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:53,519
You recognize that smell?

1157
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:56,436
Fear.

1158
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:01,952
No! Leave me!

1159
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:07,636
Get off me! I command you.

1160
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:11,679
No!

1161
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:14,197
No!

1162
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:18,119
I'll kill you!

1163
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:19,873
I'll kill you all!

1164
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:46,555
Booyah!

1165
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:13,439
I'm glad I didn't miss this.

1166
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:15,995
So am I.

1167
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:17,670
Yeah.

1168
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:19,280
Now she's glad.

1169
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:52,953
Thank you is not enough
for what you did.

1170
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:56,473
I just undid a mistake, that's all.

1171
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:07,552
How did you get the house back
from the bank?

1172
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:10,080
I bought the bank.

1173
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:13,715
The whole bank?

1174
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:16,520
It's like a reflex with me.
I don't know.

1175
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:20,910
What?

1176
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:24,354
It's actually the worst job you can get
in a crime lab.

1177
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:27,029
But my foot's in the door.

1178
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:29,915
Yeah, I got a recommendation
from a friend.

1179
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:31,639
This is like a job job?

1180
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:33,476
Job job.

1181
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:38,800
Look at you go.

1182
01:46:57,040 --> 01:47:02,195
<i>Darkness, the truest darkness,
is not the absence of light.</i>

1183
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:07,796
<i>It is the conviction
that the light will never return.</i>

1184
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:10,191
Must be 100, 150 feet.

1185
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:11,916
Must be.

1186
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:14,999
Big round table.

1187
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:17,391
Six chairs, right there.

1188
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:19,954
But room for more.

1189
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:23,835
But room for more.

1190
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:28,155
<i>But the light always returns</i>

1191
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:30,198
<i>to show us things familiar.</i>

1192
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:34,394
<i>Home, family,</i>

1193
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:40,956
<i>and things entirely new,
or long overlooked.</i>

1194
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:50,951
<i>It shows us new possibilities
and challenges us to pursue them.</i>

1195
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:54,358
Yeah, and Jerry Monasco
runs the whole kit.

1196
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:56,432
I mean, he did the Bilbao job
two years ago.

1197
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:58,319
Yeah, he has it all in storage
in Croydon.

1198
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:00,233
- The Belgian?
- Right, yeah, the Belgian.

1199
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:03,518
<i>This time,
the light shone on the heroes</i>

1200
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:07,310
<i>coming out of the shadows
to tell us we won't be alone again.</i>

1201
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:14,112
<i>Our darkness was deep
and seemed to swallow all hope.</i>

1202
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:17,639
<i>But these heroes
were here the whole time</i>

1203
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:23,600
<i>to remind us that hope is real,
that you can see it.</i>

1204
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:30,516
<i>All you have to do is look,</i>

1205
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:34,355
<i>up in the sky.</i>

1206
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:35,151
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate you doing this.

1207
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:37,280
Not at all, Barry.

1208
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:39,030
Curious myself.

1209
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:41,078
Yeah, and it's not
like a competition, you know?

1210
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:43,351
Well, it is a competition.

1211
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:46,354
But, you know, it's not like
a macho measuring thing.

1212
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:47,954
But if I win, you're off the team.

1213
01:49:54,240 --> 01:49:55,076
No...

1214
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:58,554
If I win...

1215
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:01,674
Bruce said something about you
having to take us all to brunch.

1216
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:04,236
Oh, see, now that's cold.
That's a betrayal.

1217
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:06,354
I feel stung by that.

1218
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:09,514
Okay, but if I win,
I get to tell everyone.

1219
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:10,670
Deal.

1220
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:12,590
Which coast?

1221
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:15,272
You know,
I've never seen the Pacific.

1222
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:17,870
Which is that way.

1223
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:20,993
Because the sun, and it's...

1224
01:58:07,120 --> 01:58:08,270
All right,
let's keep it moving.

1225
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:10,511
Come on, Luthor. Let's go.

1226
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:12,790
Luthor!

1227
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:25,431
All right, stop jerking around, Luthor,
or I'm gonna have to come in there.

1228
01:58:58,240 --> 01:59:00,471
There he is. Welcome aboard.

1229
01:59:00,640 --> 01:59:02,393
Care for a glass of Goût de Diamants?

1230
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:06,800
I was just celebrating God's return out
of the ground and back up into the sky.

1231
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:10,718
He and his odd little friends
are forming some sort of league.

1232
01:59:10,840 --> 01:59:12,160
You better not
be wasting my time.

1233
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:16,149
No. I have too much to live for
and more important things to do.

1234
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:18,954
We have to level the playing field,
Mr. Wilson.

1235
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:21,274
To put it plainly,

1236
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:26,358
shouldn't we have
a league of our own?
