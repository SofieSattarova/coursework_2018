1
00:00:26,622 --> 00:00:28,925
Damn.

2
00:00:28,926 --> 00:00:30,625
Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn!

3
00:00:30,626 --> 00:00:33,229
Bugs, snakes, gators.

4
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,263
I hate this place.

5
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:37,500
I'm tired of this slimy crap.

6
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:39,068
Go ahead, guys. Yuk it up.

7
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:44,942
Geez, how the hell can I be
so hot and cold at the same time?

8
00:00:44,943 --> 00:00:47,577
Schizoid metabolism?

9
00:00:47,578 --> 00:00:50,580
Good one, Mort. There's nothing
like a little treasury agent humor...

10
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:52,381
to perk up the evening.

11
00:00:52,382 --> 00:00:54,251
Whose idea was this anyway?

12
00:00:54,252 --> 00:00:56,954
If memory serves me, I think
you were the guy that said,

13
00:00:56,955 --> 00:00:59,858
"I think we oughta get out of the
office and out into the field."

14
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:02,092
I said that?

15
00:01:02,093 --> 00:01:04,628
Well, welcome to the field.

16
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:07,064
Playtime's over, guys.
We gotta find that still.

17
00:01:07,065 --> 00:01:09,534
Morty, take the point.

18
00:01:09,535 --> 00:01:12,369
Why me? Why does it always
have to be me?

19
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,873
"Take the point."
Where does he get this crap?

20
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:17,143
Too many John Wayne flicks.

21
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:42,168
Guys.

22
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:43,937
Guys, wait up. Guys!

23
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,780
Wait, guys.

24
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:55,449
Slow down.

25
00:01:56,017 --> 00:01:58,319
Guys, wait up.

26
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:04,591
Something tells me we're not going
to findthat still around here.

27
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:07,060
I told you we took a
wrong turn at that last bog.

28
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:11,031
Will you can it, Dugan? I thought for sure
we were headed in the right direction.

29
00:02:11,032 --> 00:02:12,599
Yeah, you thought.

30
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,203
You're stupid. If you could
think, we wouldn't be here.

31
00:02:15,204 --> 00:02:17,137
Will you cool it, Chuck? No.

32
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:19,607
Why couldn't we get those
moonshiners during the day, huh?

33
00:02:19,608 --> 00:02:22,410
Because at night we've got
the element of surprise.

34
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:25,679
Surprise? We've got to
find 'em to surprise 'em.

35
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,447
Gentlemen. Gentlemen!
Are you crazy?

36
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:30,650
If you want to kick the
crap out of each other, fine.

37
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,354
But let's do it
back at the office.

38
00:02:33,355 --> 00:02:34,925
Suits me.

39
00:02:37,626 --> 00:02:39,627
All right then,
let's find the truck.

40
00:02:39,628 --> 00:02:40,996
Great.

41
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:48,171
- Comin', Mort?
- In a minute.

42
00:02:51,241 --> 00:02:53,343
Do you mind?

43
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,675
What the...

44
00:03:28,614 --> 00:03:30,548
Aaah!

45
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:32,918
Morty?

46
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,753
Mort?

47
00:03:35,754 --> 00:03:37,922
Mort?

48
00:03:37,923 --> 00:03:40,192
Mort, this isn't funny. Morty?

49
00:03:40,193 --> 00:03:41,959
Hey, what's going on?
What's all the yelling?

50
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,528
Morty's gone.
What do you mean, gone?

51
00:03:43,529 --> 00:03:46,230
I mean gone. One minute
he was taking a whiz by the tree,

52
00:03:46,231 --> 00:03:48,065
and the next second, zip.

53
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:50,202
Nothing. History. Okay, okay.

54
00:03:50,203 --> 00:03:52,137
Hey, he-he's around
here someplace.

55
00:03:52,138 --> 00:03:54,208
We'll find him.
Everybody fan out.

56
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,477
Morty?

57
00:03:58,011 --> 00:03:59,262
Mort?

58
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,884
Morty?

59
00:04:08,923 --> 00:04:10,790
Morty.

60
00:04:18,698 --> 00:04:20,267
Hey, guys.

61
00:04:22,203 --> 00:04:25,339
I don't think
he can hear us anymore.

62
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,942
Hey, we... we better... I mean,
we gotta get back to the truck.

63
00:04:27,943 --> 00:04:31,479
Hey, listen, buddy, we're not leaving
here without Morty. You got that?

64
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,430
Shoot that thing.

65
00:04:59,475 --> 00:05:01,709
I'm for getting
the hell out of here.

66
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,345
You and me both.

67
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:14,190
Hey, fellas.

68
00:05:14,191 --> 00:05:16,125
You're going the wrong way.
You're wrong.

69
00:05:16,126 --> 00:05:19,496
Hey, fellas.
The truck's this way.

70
00:05:40,084 --> 00:05:42,754
Oh, no. Oh, God, no.

71
00:05:44,888 --> 00:05:47,158
Hurry up. Come on!

72
00:05:56,668 --> 00:05:59,005
Boy, are we glad
to see you guys.

73
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,409
Hey, look. We're government agents.
You... You can't...

74
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,380
Whoa.

75
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:13,485
Please, let me find them.

76
00:06:13,486 --> 00:06:15,054
Please, let me find them.

77
00:06:39,046 --> 00:06:40,046
Oh, no.

78
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:54,829
Oh, no! Please, God! No!

79
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:02,032
Thank you.

80
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:04,836
If you hadn't come along, I...

81
00:08:06,271 --> 00:08:07,971
Hey, just where
did you come from?

82
00:08:07,972 --> 00:08:09,072
The bog.

83
00:08:09,073 --> 00:08:11,642
You don't have a still
around here, do you?

84
00:08:13,512 --> 00:08:15,746
It doesn't matter.

85
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:18,549
What matters is,
you saved my life.

86
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,586
Thank you.

87
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:22,221
My name's Dugan.

88
00:08:22,222 --> 00:08:23,856
Harry Dugan.

89
00:08:24,757 --> 00:08:27,359

Morning, guys. Sorry I'm late.

117
00:11:01,254 --> 00:11:04,922
I just came from that new transcendental
therapy place over in Malibu.

118
00:11:04,923 --> 00:11:07,360
I can't believe it.
They didn't even validate.

119
00:11:07,361 --> 00:11:09,529
Thirsty, babies?

120
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,999
Anyway, this weird guy in some
reject Star Trek costume...

121
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,635
tells that me none of my
relationships will ever work...

122
00:11:15,636 --> 00:11:17,904
till I confront my feelings
about my stepfather.

123
00:11:17,905 --> 00:11:21,408
I mean, what's going on here, a
conspiracy?

124
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:24,644
That's the fourth shrink who's
told me that in four years.

125
00:11:24,645 --> 00:11:28,182
Of course if they knew who I was
talking to, I'd really be committed.

126
00:11:28,183 --> 00:11:30,283
Why can't men
be more like plants?

127
00:11:30,284 --> 00:11:33,488
I mean, you can stroke a plant,
and it doesn't get the wrong idea.

128
00:11:34,856 --> 00:11:38,025
Okay. Okay, you're right.
I'll do it.

129
00:11:38,026 --> 00:11:41,060
I'm not even gonna call. I'm just
gonna go down there and confront him.

130
00:11:41,061 --> 00:11:42,963
I mean, why should he
mess up my life?

131
00:11:42,964 --> 00:11:45,065
He sure didn't
care about my mother.

132
00:11:45,066 --> 00:11:47,066
He didn't even
give her a funeral.

133
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:49,405
Or if he did,
he didn't invite me.

134
00:11:50,305 --> 00:11:51,305
Eunice?

135
00:11:52,842 --> 00:11:55,676
I've gotta go
straighten out my life.

136
00:11:55,677 --> 00:11:57,546
I know you don't know
what I'm talking about.

137
00:11:57,547 --> 00:11:59,214
But there's something
I've gotta take care of,

138
00:11:59,215 --> 00:12:01,383
and I can't do it by vegetating
here in this store.

139
00:12:01,384 --> 00:12:04,420
Sorry about that. No, now don't
try to talk me out of it.

140
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:06,922
Now, I'm leaving you in full
charge of my friends here.

141
00:12:06,923 --> 00:12:08,924
Keep them watered, talk
to them... and read to them.

142
00:12:08,925 --> 00:12:10,759
Especially the sports section.

143
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,461
They've really got a thing
for the Lakers.

144
00:12:12,462 --> 00:12:14,597
And leave the TV on
at all times.

145
00:12:14,598 --> 00:12:17,232
They love that guy on T.J.
what's-his-name. Okay?

146
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:19,837
Okay. Bye, babies.

147
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,497
Dr. Arcane. Calling Dr. Arcane.

148
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:48,832
Shut up.

149
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,738
So?

150
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,475
The two new patients are
recovering from the operation.

151
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,342
Dr. Rochelle has high hopes.

152
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,814
The others...
Yes, what about them?

153
00:13:33,815 --> 00:13:35,749
See for yourself.

154
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:47,761
The gene splicing
has gone extremely well.

155
00:13:47,762 --> 00:13:50,731
We're very close on hitting on
the right D.N.A. combination.

156
00:13:50,732 --> 00:13:55,168
I somehow sense that's an unfinished
sentence. So finish it, please.

157
00:13:56,771 --> 00:14:00,941
Some of the rejected specimens
have mutated quite startlingly.

158
00:14:00,942 --> 00:14:03,010
I'm quite aware
of the mistakes, Lana.

159
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:06,514
The mistakes here, and the ones
that got away into the swamp.

160
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:08,349
What I'm interested in
is results.

161
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,519
How's Rochelle doing with
the new ones? Over here.

162
00:14:18,193 --> 00:14:19,662
Well?

163
00:14:19,663 --> 00:14:23,231
I'm afraid the genetic serum
worked in reverse again on this one.

164
00:14:23,232 --> 00:14:26,467
Perhaps the tranquilizer darts
your men use daffected the blood.

165
00:14:26,468 --> 00:14:32,907
Dr. Rochelle, you've been at this for
months. No significant developments.

166
00:14:32,908 --> 00:14:36,745
Only a zoo full of
misshapen monstrosities,

167
00:14:36,746 --> 00:14:38,547
a cemetery's worth of corpses...

168
00:14:38,548 --> 00:14:40,717
and no rejuvenation formula.

169
00:14:40,718 --> 00:14:42,718
But we will get it.

170
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:45,622
When? Soon.

171
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:49,625
- Won't we, Doctor?
- Yes. Quite soon, Dr. Arcane.

172
00:14:49,626 --> 00:14:52,095
And what's that?

173
00:15:03,373 --> 00:15:05,375
Another disappointment.

174
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:07,878
I tried mingling his genes
with a phylus usu species.

175
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:10,114
- The what?
- Cockroach.

176
00:15:10,115 --> 00:15:13,250
We have enough
insects in this place, Doctor.

177
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:16,621
Destroy it before it multiplies.
Come.

178
00:15:56,697 --> 00:15:59,199
One more afternoon
like this, Dr. Rochelle,

179
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,467
and it's back to Betty Ford.

180
00:16:01,468 --> 00:16:04,070
Please, Doctor, there's
no more need for the clinic.

181
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:06,773
No, not the clinic, stupid.

182
00:16:06,774 --> 00:16:09,242
He'll turn you into Betty Ford.

183
00:16:09,243 --> 00:16:10,844
Funny.

184
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,847
Very funny.

185
00:16:15,784 --> 00:16:18,752
Well, anyhow, that's
the long and the short of it, Doc.

186
00:16:18,753 --> 00:16:21,389
This fella come running out of
the swamp, heading straight...

187
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,157
for the Squat and Gobble
restaurant.

188
00:16:23,158 --> 00:16:25,926
Damn near scared
old Jasper Kincaid to death.

189
00:16:25,927 --> 00:16:27,862
You know Jasper Kincaid.
He cooks there.

190
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:30,063
Uh, no, I don't.
I-I never go there.

191
00:16:30,064 --> 00:16:32,500
Well, you missed some damn
good grub.

192
00:16:32,501 --> 00:16:36,104
But I'm digressin'.
This fella... Dugan his name was...

193
00:16:36,105 --> 00:16:39,709
He spins this wild yarn about
comin' out here to your property...

194
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,576
and runnin' across
this giant leech thing.

195
00:16:42,577 --> 00:16:46,515
Said he lost two of his buddies.
Sucked 'em dry right there on the spot.

196
00:16:46,516 --> 00:16:48,549
On the spot, you say.

197
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,852
Well, that's what
he says anyway.

198
00:16:50,853 --> 00:16:53,689
Says he himself was, uh,
saved from the jaws of death...

199
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,225
by this great big
old green man from Mars.

200
00:16:56,226 --> 00:16:58,127
A man from Mars?

201
00:16:58,128 --> 00:17:00,629
Yeah. It's a planet,
you know. You don't say?

202
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,665
Uh-huh. Yeah.

203
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:06,703
Ah, thank you, sweet thing.

204
00:17:06,704 --> 00:17:10,974
You know, Doc, you got yourself a regular
Playboy Mansion out here, don't you?

205
00:17:10,975 --> 00:17:14,143
Dr. Zurrell is
a highly trained scientist.

206
00:17:14,144 --> 00:17:16,579
She's one of the world's
leading specialists...

207
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,781
in the construction
of human genes.

208
00:17:18,782 --> 00:17:21,252
Well, I tell you what, Doc.
If you give her any homework,

209
00:17:21,253 --> 00:17:24,320
she can get in my jeans
anytime she wants to.

210
00:17:34,699 --> 00:17:37,268
It's beautiful.
What do they call it?

211
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:39,670
It's a Malibu Classic.

212
00:17:39,671 --> 00:17:42,339
My cousin Beamo just
rebuilt the carburetor.

213
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,108
He do a little
part-time preaching too...

214
00:17:44,109 --> 00:17:47,244
down atthe Baptist Tabernacle
and Rib Shack.

215
00:17:47,245 --> 00:17:49,213
Looks like we're in
the middle of nowhere.

216
00:17:49,214 --> 00:17:50,882
Are you sure we're going
the right way?

217
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:53,717
Ain't but two ways you can go.
This way and back.

218
00:17:53,718 --> 00:17:56,154
And we ain't been this way.
And we ain't going back.

219
00:17:56,155 --> 00:17:59,025
So I guess we're going the right way.
That make sense to you?

220
00:18:03,462 --> 00:18:07,465
Tell me, was there any evidence
of swamp mud found on this man?

221
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:10,336
- Why, he's covered with it.
- I'll tell you what happened.

222
00:18:10,337 --> 00:18:12,404
These men probably
lost their way,

223
00:18:12,405 --> 00:18:13,972
fell into the bog and all died.

224
00:18:13,973 --> 00:18:17,242
Except for Dugan. Now,
you know, Doc, that makes sense.

225
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:19,979
I probably oughta be thanking you.

226
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,716
You done saved me a couple of
thousand hours of investigation.

227
00:18:23,717 --> 00:18:27,154
Now, I've still gotta perform a search
of the property. You understand that?

228
00:18:27,155 --> 00:18:28,722
Of course. Of course.

229
00:18:28,723 --> 00:18:31,525
And Mr. Gunn here
will show you around.

230
00:18:31,526 --> 00:18:35,628
Doc, if you don't mind, I'd prefer
one of these pretty young ladies.

231
00:18:35,629 --> 00:18:38,298
Sheriff, I agree with you.

232
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:40,766
This young lady here
will show you around.

233
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,037
Oh, thank you, Doc. Good-bye.

234
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,243
The man from Mars is Holland.
He's alive in the swamp.

235
00:18:49,244 --> 00:18:52,947
That's not possible. My men
have combed every inch of that swamp.

236
00:18:52,948 --> 00:18:56,216
Well, uh, comb it again. And remember,
you're not looking for a human being.

237
00:18:56,217 --> 00:18:58,820
You're looking for a plant.

238
00:18:58,821 --> 00:19:01,189
Maybe he married an avocado.

239
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:04,024
Uh, yes, yes, and, uh,
moved to California.

240
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:05,594
Find out.

241
00:19:07,129 --> 00:19:09,899
You want to check that address
I gave you again?

242
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,500
Yep. That...
That's the right address.

243
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:15,071
It's the Arcane mansion. Arcane?

244
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:19,207
What's a lady like you doing going out
to a godforsaken place like that?

245
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:22,044
Dr. Arcane is my stepfather.

246
00:19:22,045 --> 00:19:24,680
Huh. What do they do
out there anyway?

247
00:19:24,681 --> 00:19:27,016
Oh, a little of this,
a little of that.

248
00:19:27,017 --> 00:19:29,051
Yeah, I bet.

249
00:19:29,052 --> 00:19:31,954
Does the name Frankenstein
mean anything to you, lady?

250
00:19:31,955 --> 00:19:35,226
All the way out here
for $30. My God.

251
00:19:39,664 --> 00:19:42,633
- Oh, uh, excuse me, Doctor.
- Yes?

252
00:19:42,634 --> 00:19:46,137
There's a cab at the gate with a woman
in it. She claims to be your stepdaughter.

253
00:19:46,138 --> 00:19:48,673
Good God. Abigail.

254
00:19:53,645 --> 00:19:57,416
She looks like her mother.
She looks exactly like her mother.

255
00:19:57,417 --> 00:20:00,953
Doctor, I've just been hit
by an idea.

256
00:20:00,954 --> 00:20:05,224
Should Abigail have the same
genetic code as her mother,

257
00:20:05,225 --> 00:20:07,592
we could be in business,
couldn't we?

258
00:20:07,593 --> 00:20:10,329
- Yes, we could.
- Have a blood sample taken from her.

259
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,398
- How do we do that?
- You'll find a way.

260
00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:15,167
Lana, I want you to make sure...

261
00:20:15,168 --> 00:20:17,403
that Abigail is taken
care of beautifully.

262
00:20:17,404 --> 00:20:20,372
She must be considered
as our prized possession.

263
00:20:20,373 --> 00:20:22,843
Let's go and greet her.

264
00:20:46,568 --> 00:20:48,102
Well, this is going to be good.

265
00:20:48,103 --> 00:20:51,973
Abigail, what a wonderful surprise.

266
00:20:51,974 --> 00:20:54,408
My God, how you've grown.
You look marvelous.

267
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:57,011
How ya' doin'? I'm doing fine.

268
00:20:57,012 --> 00:20:58,380
Nice place.

269
00:20:58,381 --> 00:21:02,717
Yes. It's a remarkable example
of antebellum architecture.

270
00:21:02,718 --> 00:21:05,753
Don't you think? Please, let's go in.
They'll bring your bags.

271
00:21:05,754 --> 00:21:08,524
Let me introduce you
to some of my collaborators.

272
00:21:08,525 --> 00:21:10,825
This is Lana Zurrell...
Dr. Zurrell.

273
00:21:10,826 --> 00:21:12,660
My right hand.

274
00:21:12,661 --> 00:21:15,063
My stepdaughter, Abigail.

275
00:21:15,064 --> 00:21:16,064
Hello.

276
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,768
And this is Dr. Rochelle.

277
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:21,336
An extreme pleasure.

278
00:21:21,337 --> 00:21:23,706
Brilliant man.
Does wonders with genetics.

279
00:21:23,707 --> 00:21:27,376
Your stepfather and I hope to be
able to reverse the aging process.

280
00:21:27,377 --> 00:21:29,712
Uh, yes. Reverse it completely.

281
00:21:29,713 --> 00:21:33,916
Now, Abigail, this is your home.

282
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,486
I want you to be comfortable,
cozy and happy.

283
00:21:36,487 --> 00:21:39,888
Get yourself settled, and
we'll have dinner together tonight.

284
00:21:39,889 --> 00:21:40,990
Hmm? Of course.

285
00:21:40,991 --> 00:21:44,594
Lana will show you to your room.

286
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:46,832
Come along, dear.

287
00:21:51,236 --> 00:21:53,338
She looks great.

288
00:21:55,307 --> 00:21:57,108
Your room is up here.

289
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:58,676
I'm sure it's very pretty.

290
00:21:58,677 --> 00:22:00,744
Just like everything
my stepfather owns.

291
00:22:00,745 --> 00:22:03,414
Your stepfather
has excellent taste.

292
00:22:03,415 --> 00:22:06,183
Seems like a strange man to me.

293
00:22:06,184 --> 00:22:09,620
Dr. Arcane is a great man.
He's a genius.

294
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:11,989
Sometimes you have to
indulge greatness.

295
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:15,094
Is that your job here?
To indulge him?

296
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:23,235
My job is to assist your
stepfather in any way I can.

297
00:22:23,236 --> 00:22:25,736
He's an exacting man,

298
00:22:25,737 --> 00:22:27,339
as I'm sure you'll see,

299
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,076
and one who demands obedience
from those around him.

300
00:22:30,077 --> 00:22:33,313
Why is it I think
you enjoy that?

301
00:22:34,381 --> 00:22:36,449
We have a unique relationship.

302
00:22:39,219 --> 00:22:40,987
I'll bet you do.

303
00:22:42,022 --> 00:22:43,990
You are a rude girl.

304
00:22:43,991 --> 00:22:46,592
You come in here, disrupting
the doctor'simportant work.

305
00:22:46,593 --> 00:22:48,161
Important work?

306
00:22:48,162 --> 00:22:51,931
Dr. Arcane and I are working on
a large humanitarian project.

307
00:22:51,932 --> 00:22:55,503
Well, you can call my stepfather
many things. But humanitarian?

308
00:22:57,205 --> 00:23:00,274
You don't know him like I do.

309
00:23:00,275 --> 00:23:02,411
Will you be staying long?

310
00:23:03,877 --> 00:23:05,447
What's it to you?

311
00:23:06,614 --> 00:23:09,217
Well, I suggest if you have
any further questions,

312
00:23:09,218 --> 00:23:11,519
you just ask the doctor.

313
00:23:13,021 --> 00:23:15,324
Right.

314
00:23:16,056 --> 00:23:18,059
Hmm. Very pretty.

315
00:23:49,393 --> 00:23:51,361
Something wrong?

316
00:23:52,963 --> 00:23:56,265
I don't see anything wrong.

317
00:23:56,266 --> 00:23:57,833
Well, I'm delighted.

318
00:23:57,834 --> 00:24:00,903
In fact, I like
what I see very much,

319
00:24:00,904 --> 00:24:04,475
and what I don't see, even more.

320
00:24:05,842 --> 00:24:08,444
You're not showing
any signs yet, are you?

321
00:24:08,445 --> 00:24:10,147
Different texture maybe.

322
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:12,916
We'll find a way
to reverse the aging.

323
00:24:12,917 --> 00:24:14,917
I won't let anything
happen to you, my darling.

324
00:24:14,918 --> 00:24:16,621
Lana.

325
00:24:18,556 --> 00:24:19,990
Lana.

326
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:22,727
Just stay vital, my darling.

327
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:51,625
Mmm.

328
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:32,934
Hey, Omie, it's me. Let me in.
It's pouring out here.

329
00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:36,704
Well, ain't you gonna let me in?

330
00:25:36,705 --> 00:25:38,839
Open the stupid door.

331
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,808
Looks kind of wet out there.

332
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:44,445
Damn straight it is.
Now open the stupid door and let me in.

333
00:25:44,446 --> 00:25:46,347
What's the password?

334
00:25:46,348 --> 00:25:49,049
Password?
What do you mean, password?

335
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,019
We never had a password.

336
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,188
Got one now.

337
00:25:53,189 --> 00:25:55,591
You want a password?
I'll give you a password.

338
00:25:55,592 --> 00:25:57,959
Oh, I'm so scared.

339
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,561
All right, you. Here I come.

340
00:26:00,562 --> 00:26:02,631
Hey, that's the password.

341
00:26:02,632 --> 00:26:05,199
Whoa! Help! Get me out of here.

342
00:26:08,871 --> 00:26:10,406
You jerk.

343
00:26:10,407 --> 00:26:12,809
So you got a little wet.
Big deal.

344
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,677
Thought you said
nothing mattered.

345
00:26:14,678 --> 00:26:16,245
Nothing does. Your folks gone?

346
00:26:16,246 --> 00:26:19,014
Left 10 minutes ago.
They're not coming right back?

347
00:26:19,015 --> 00:26:22,953
Hey, man, it is bingo night.
They'll be gone for hours.

348
00:26:22,954 --> 00:26:25,688
- Then you got 'em?
- Do I got 'em?

349
00:26:25,689 --> 00:26:29,225
- Well, let's see 'em.
- Be cool, bro. Be cool.

350
00:26:29,226 --> 00:26:32,195
What are you drinking?
Nothing yet. Got any hard stuff?

351
00:26:34,433 --> 00:26:38,370
♪♪

352
00:26:40,871 --> 00:26:42,940
There you have it.

353
00:26:42,941 --> 00:26:47,045
1988... the year in pictures.
Dig in.

354
00:26:48,413 --> 00:26:50,848
Wow, I can't believe it!

355
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:54,217
Look at these babes!

356
00:26:54,218 --> 00:26:57,356
Check out the one in the June
issue of the Big and Busty.

357
00:26:57,357 --> 00:26:59,824
She's one of
the old man's favorites.

358
00:26:59,825 --> 00:27:02,761
My God. She's a Scorpio.

359
00:27:02,762 --> 00:27:05,964
Hey, great. I'm an Aries.
They get along great!

360
00:27:05,965 --> 00:27:08,232
My man, I wouldn't
steer you wrong.

361
00:27:10,836 --> 00:27:13,438
My parents! It's my parents!

362
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:16,409
- What'll we do? What'll we do?
- Put 'em away. Get 'em away.

363
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,110
Where? Where?

364
00:27:18,111 --> 00:27:20,913
Anywhere! Anywhere.
Just make 'em gone. Right away.

365
00:27:20,914 --> 00:27:22,281
Right away.

366
00:27:22,282 --> 00:27:25,519
I thought you said
they were playing bingo!

367
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:31,357
Be right there, Mom.

368
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,258
Take a chill pill, man.
You look guilty as hell.

369
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:35,729
Just a sec.

370
00:27:37,998 --> 00:27:40,201
Don't be nervous, okay? Okay.

371
00:27:52,948 --> 00:27:54,197
Aaah!

372
00:27:58,421 --> 00:28:01,322
How we gonna get out of here?
The window's locked.

373
00:28:01,323 --> 00:28:04,127
Hey!
That's my dad'sbowling ball!

374
00:28:09,065 --> 00:28:11,433
Come on. I'm coming.

375
00:28:11,434 --> 00:28:15,002
Hurry up! I'm hurrying.

376
00:28:30,454 --> 00:28:33,690
Man, it's monster central
around here tonight.

377
00:28:58,817 --> 00:29:01,453
They better not hit
my mom's new station wagon.

378
00:29:03,088 --> 00:29:04,621
Damn!

379
00:29:04,622 --> 00:29:07,025
Some insurance man's
gonna mess his pants!

380
00:29:25,544 --> 00:29:28,614
Man, what a great fire!

381
00:29:28,615 --> 00:29:31,584
Shut up.
They got my mom's car too.

382
00:29:40,627 --> 00:29:42,161
Wow.

383
00:30:11,793 --> 00:30:15,063
Yeah! I think
that green dude's good.

384
00:30:31,614 --> 00:30:33,148
Holland.

385
00:30:33,149 --> 00:30:35,517
He's in the area.

386
00:30:35,518 --> 00:30:38,587
Find him, and bring him here.

387
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:40,289
You got it, Doc.

388
00:31:29,842 --> 00:31:32,509
Formally dressed for dinner.
How fun.

389
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,278
Yes, indeed.
After all these years,

390
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:36,882
I never thought
I would ever see you again.

391
00:31:36,883 --> 00:31:40,283
Perhaps this visit will bring us close.
Very close.

392
00:31:40,284 --> 00:31:43,788
Excuse me, Dr. Arcane,
but we haven't found anything yet.

393
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:45,422
Oh, it doesn't matter.
What's going on?

394
00:31:45,423 --> 00:31:48,260
Uh, nothing. A group of
hitchhikers have lost their way.

395
00:31:48,261 --> 00:31:50,461
Oh, I don't believe
you two have met.

396
00:31:50,462 --> 00:31:53,198
Abigail, this is Mr. Gunn,
our security chief.

397
00:31:53,199 --> 00:31:55,500
And his assistant,
Miss Poinsettia.

398
00:31:55,501 --> 00:31:57,069
Enchantí.

399
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,804
On parole is more like it.

400
00:31:58,805 --> 00:32:01,041
Now, come on. Come on.

401
00:32:03,177 --> 00:32:07,279
Now, Abigail,
tell me about yourself.

402
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,116
What have you been doing
these last 10 years?

403
00:32:10,117 --> 00:32:12,217
Gee, that's funny.

404
00:32:12,218 --> 00:32:14,288
I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

405
00:32:15,755 --> 00:32:17,291
I'll be blunt.

406
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:20,492
Why this unexpected visit?

407
00:32:20,493 --> 00:32:24,030
I seem to be haunted
by things I can't resolve.

408
00:32:24,031 --> 00:32:26,866
About you. About my mother.
Her death.

409
00:32:26,867 --> 00:32:29,402
Why was there no funeral?

410
00:32:29,403 --> 00:32:32,339
She wanted to be cremated
without ceremony.

411
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,076
My mother loved me.
I was her only child.

412
00:32:35,077 --> 00:32:36,844
I know she would have
wanted me there.

413
00:32:36,845 --> 00:32:40,580
Abigail, I loved your mother
very deeply.

414
00:32:40,581 --> 00:32:43,184
I didn't contact you because...

415
00:32:43,185 --> 00:32:47,354
it was always very clear that you
didn't approve of my marriage to her.

416
00:32:47,355 --> 00:32:50,591
Abigail, why don't we
put all this behind us.

417
00:32:50,592 --> 00:32:52,894
I want us to be friends.

418
00:32:52,895 --> 00:32:54,296
Good friends.

419
00:32:57,432 --> 00:32:59,701
Lana, are you there? Yes.

420
00:32:59,702 --> 00:33:02,804
There's a small box in
the desk in my bedroom.

421
00:33:02,805 --> 00:33:06,375
Would you bring it down
to the study, please? Thank you.

422
00:33:06,376 --> 00:33:08,410
Is this your way
of buying me off?

423
00:33:08,411 --> 00:33:11,146
Buy off?
What an ugly expression.

424
00:33:11,147 --> 00:33:14,150
It's something very precious,
and I want you to have it.

425
00:33:23,426 --> 00:33:26,997
- It's beautiful.
- It belonged to your mother.

426
00:33:30,201 --> 00:33:32,335
What the...

427
00:33:32,336 --> 00:33:34,904
Ow! Oh, my God. It's sharp.

428
00:33:34,905 --> 00:33:36,473
Ow. Ooh, ooh.

429
00:33:36,474 --> 00:33:38,275
Let me dab it. Let me dab it.
Dr. Rochelle...

430
00:33:38,276 --> 00:33:40,343
We will have him look at the cut.
No, it's fine.

431
00:33:40,344 --> 00:33:42,980
Oh, look, it's not even bleeding.
See, I don't even need a Band-Aid.

432
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:45,015
Just a little fresh air.
Excuse me.

433
00:33:45,016 --> 00:33:47,017
You sure?

434
00:33:47,018 --> 00:33:50,421
Now we've got the blood we need.

435
00:33:50,422 --> 00:33:53,023
Brilliant. My name is Gigi.
My name is Gigi.

436
00:33:53,024 --> 00:33:54,793
Uh, we know. We know.

437
00:33:54,794 --> 00:33:56,896
This doesn't make sense.

438
00:33:58,363 --> 00:34:02,234
What is a five-letter word
for an armed security man?

439
00:34:02,235 --> 00:34:03,970
Moron.

440
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:08,107
Moron? No, it can't be moron.

441
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,710
Moron... No.

442
00:34:12,446 --> 00:34:14,714
Excuse me, Miss Arcane.

443
00:34:14,715 --> 00:34:17,450
The swamp is a very
dangerous place at night.

444
00:34:17,451 --> 00:34:20,120
So is the dining room.
I'll take my chances.

445
00:34:21,222 --> 00:34:24,091
Like mother, like daughter?

446
00:34:25,894 --> 00:34:28,128
What do you know
about my mother?

447
00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:30,197
How much you want to know?

448
00:34:38,672 --> 00:34:42,109
Should we go after her? What do
you mean, "should"? Of course you do.

449
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,745
Discreetly.

450
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,701
Ooh-wee!

451
00:35:06,702 --> 00:35:08,371
Great batch of shine,
huh, Gurdell?

452
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:10,672
Whoo! Best this month, Clyde.

453
00:35:10,673 --> 00:35:12,340
What are we gonna do
for fun tonight?

454
00:35:12,341 --> 00:35:14,844
- Feel like stealin' a car?
- Nah.

455
00:35:14,845 --> 00:35:17,680
- How 'bout we burn down a house?
- Nah.

456
00:35:17,681 --> 00:35:20,749
Well, why don't we drive over to
Uncle Shed'sand run over some dogs?

457
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,418
I'm sick of running over dogs.

458
00:35:22,419 --> 00:35:24,253
Besides, that place is spooked.

459
00:35:24,254 --> 00:35:26,022
What do you feel
like doing then, Gurdell?

460
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:28,292
My brain's tired of coming up
with all these ideas.

461
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:31,194
I feel like...
I feel like killing something.

462
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:33,363
You always feel like
killing something.

463
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:35,966
Maybe I'll kill you.
I'll kill you back with my dying breath.

464
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,736
Your breath's so bad, you just
might do that.

465
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,408
Aw, shut up, Gurdell! It's time
we went to town and got us a woman.

466
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,376
I forgot what one looked like.

467
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:48,478
Do you remember what
they looked like, Clyde?

468
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,582
No, I haven't even seen
a sheep around here lately.

469
00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:57,754
Excuse me.

470
00:35:57,755 --> 00:35:59,557
Who says there ain't no God?

471
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:01,427
Goddang moonshine!

472
00:36:03,195 --> 00:36:06,731
You guys wouldn't happen to know the
way back to the Arcane place, would you?

473
00:36:06,732 --> 00:36:08,766
You talk funny. Where you from?

474
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:11,769
- California.
- I hate California!

475
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,172
I'll move. No problem.

476
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:15,941
Does anybody know
you're back here?

477
00:36:15,942 --> 00:36:18,677
FBI, Charles Bronson,
Chicago Bears.

478
00:36:18,678 --> 00:36:21,080
You're real pretty.

479
00:36:21,081 --> 00:36:23,482
- All makeup.
- She's from California.

480
00:36:23,483 --> 00:36:24,716
I like her. I hate her.

481
00:36:24,717 --> 00:36:26,452
You ready? I'm like lunch meat.
I'm always ready.

482
00:36:26,453 --> 00:36:28,120
Let's get her. Ow!

483
00:36:28,121 --> 00:36:31,123
Stop it!

484
00:36:31,124 --> 00:36:33,793
You're hurting me!

485
00:36:33,794 --> 00:36:35,929
Help me, someone!

486
00:36:41,802 --> 00:36:44,437
Peel him, Gurdell. Peel him!

487
00:36:45,506 --> 00:36:47,875
This guy's coles law.

488
00:36:57,919 --> 00:37:00,689
Let's get out of here.
I'm with you.

489
00:37:14,104 --> 00:37:16,137
Um, thanks.

490
00:37:19,342 --> 00:37:23,113
You're...
You're a plant, aren't you?

491
00:37:24,747 --> 00:37:27,483
You shouldn't be
walking around here at night.

492
00:37:27,484 --> 00:37:29,418
Who are you? What are you?

493
00:37:29,419 --> 00:37:31,054
I'm Alec Holland. And you?

494
00:37:31,055 --> 00:37:34,057
Abby Arcane. Arcane?

495
00:37:34,058 --> 00:37:37,493
- His daughter?
- Stepdaughter. You know him?

496
00:37:37,494 --> 00:37:39,396
I know him.

497
00:37:39,397 --> 00:37:41,497
That sounds likean indictment.

498
00:37:41,498 --> 00:37:44,301
Did those men hurt you?

499
00:37:44,302 --> 00:37:47,870
I'm sorry. Uh, sometimes
I forget what I look like.

500
00:37:47,871 --> 00:37:49,738
You gotta be kidding.

501
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:51,907
This is for real?

502
00:37:51,908 --> 00:37:53,677
I don't understand.
How can that be?

503
00:37:53,678 --> 00:37:57,114
If I tell you about Arcane,
you'll understand.

504
00:37:57,749 --> 00:38:00,152
Please. Okay.

505
00:38:04,122 --> 00:38:06,890
My experiments in genetics
brought me here to the swamp.

506
00:38:06,891 --> 00:38:10,094
My sister and I had developed
a bio-restorative formula...

507
00:38:10,095 --> 00:38:11,895
that could double
the world's food production.

508
00:38:11,896 --> 00:38:13,764
Arcane stole the serum,

509
00:38:13,765 --> 00:38:17,670
and I was caught in a
terrible explosion and fire.

510
00:38:29,915 --> 00:38:31,749
The flames consumed by body.

511
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,052
But somehow the chemicals
in the formula...

512
00:38:34,053 --> 00:38:36,390
reconstructed my tissue from
the slime in the swamp.

513
00:38:38,992 --> 00:38:42,160
Your stepfather found me,
and I killed him.

514
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:44,797
Or so I thought.

515
00:38:44,798 --> 00:38:48,102
Abby, Arcane is a very evil man.

516
00:38:48,103 --> 00:38:50,002
You must leave immediately.

517
00:38:50,003 --> 00:38:51,737
I can't.

518
00:38:51,738 --> 00:38:53,972
He knows about my mother.

519
00:38:53,973 --> 00:38:56,210
I've gotta find out
what happened to her.

520
00:38:56,211 --> 00:38:57,811
What really happened to her.

521
00:39:01,581 --> 00:39:03,516
If I can't talk you out of this,

522
00:39:03,517 --> 00:39:05,151
I want you to know,

523
00:39:05,152 --> 00:39:06,986
I'll be close by.

524
00:39:08,422 --> 00:39:09,524
Bye, Alec.

525
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,677
Sir, they've just
spotted Swamp Thing out by the marsh.

526
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,250
Turn him into guacamole!

527
00:40:07,251 --> 00:40:09,419
Launch the grenade!

528
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,158
Yeah!

529
00:40:14,492 --> 00:40:17,494
Let's go. Let's clear out, man.

530
00:40:17,495 --> 00:40:20,863
Send a search team
into the marsh immediately.

531
00:40:20,864 --> 00:40:22,165
Yes, sir.

532
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:25,868
And tell them not to come back
without Holland's remains.

533
00:40:25,869 --> 00:40:28,072
We need a piece of the idiot
for the experiment.

534
00:40:29,139 --> 00:40:33,143
Well, sure, Doc.
But, uh, why the bother?

535
00:40:33,144 --> 00:40:37,348
I mean, after that blasting, he's not
gonna be sliming up the works no more.

536
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:41,620
I'd rather be pessimistic.
Just in case.

537
00:41:11,985 --> 00:41:13,519
Where do you think
you're taking me?

538
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,489
I don't have to go
anywhere with you.

539
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:17,690
Keep moving.
Get your mitts off me.

540
00:41:17,691 --> 00:41:19,259
Just keep your hands off
the merchandise.

541
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:22,795
Oh, great!
And this must be the playroom.

542
00:41:22,796 --> 00:41:26,366
I don't thinkany crazed scientist
should be without one.

543
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:28,402
You know, Alec Holland may
have looked like a monster,

544
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,437
but he had the mind
and the feelings of a man.

545
00:41:30,438 --> 00:41:33,440
You didn't have to hunt him down
like a monster. Temper, temper.

546
00:41:33,441 --> 00:41:35,876
We did have to. Your stepfather
was almost dead...

547
00:41:35,877 --> 00:41:37,944
when Dr. Zurrell and I
found him in the bog.

548
00:41:37,945 --> 00:41:40,781
Over a period of months, we were able
to restore him to his present form.

549
00:41:40,782 --> 00:41:43,083
Unfortunately, we still need
a sample of Holland's tissue...

550
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,651
for the locking serum
we're gonna make.

551
00:41:44,652 --> 00:41:46,353
Without the proper ingredients
for the formula,

552
00:41:46,354 --> 00:41:48,222
your stepfather's body
will eventually deteriorate.

553
00:41:48,223 --> 00:41:50,325
Huh. Like his mind.

554
00:41:50,326 --> 00:41:53,194
Abigail, keep cool.
I just have one question to ask you.

555
00:41:53,195 --> 00:41:54,861
How did my mother
fit into all this?

556
00:41:54,862 --> 00:41:56,965
Your mother worked with us.

557
00:41:56,966 --> 00:42:00,568
And her death was the unfortunate
side effect of our mutual experiments.

558
00:42:00,569 --> 00:42:03,371
Her genetic code was perfect.
Just like yours, by the way.

559
00:42:03,372 --> 00:42:06,140
- You're mad!
- I never felt saner.

560
00:42:06,141 --> 00:42:09,277
Take good care
of my stepdaughter, please.

561
00:42:09,278 --> 00:42:11,615
Whatever you say, Doc.

562
00:42:14,383 --> 00:42:17,820
My darling, you know
we're doing everything we can.

563
00:42:17,821 --> 00:42:19,722
Well, not enough, obviously.

564
00:42:19,723 --> 00:42:23,627
But we're so close. Now that we have
your daughter, it's a matter of days.

565
00:42:23,628 --> 00:42:26,862
I'm afraid it's a little more
complicated than that.

566
00:42:26,863 --> 00:42:29,434
I don't mean any harm to Abby.

567
00:42:30,668 --> 00:42:32,236
And yet...

568
00:42:32,936 --> 00:42:34,970
You always seem amused.

569
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:38,508
Even when the consequences
are most deadly.

570
00:42:38,509 --> 00:42:40,546
Laughter is best, isn't it?

571
00:42:47,453 --> 00:42:50,889
- What is it?
- I'm sorry to disturb you, Doctor, but it's urgent.

572
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:53,825
Coming.

573
00:42:58,229 --> 00:43:00,231
Put this on.

574
00:43:06,572 --> 00:43:08,272
Come in.

575
00:43:08,273 --> 00:43:11,609
Good evening, Doctor. Please forgive
the intrusion, but I must speak with you.

576
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:13,379
It's very important. Go ahead.

577
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,446
Um...

578
00:43:14,447 --> 00:43:16,347
My apologies, Dr. Zurrell,

579
00:43:16,348 --> 00:43:19,084
but this is a rather
private matter.

580
00:43:19,085 --> 00:43:20,753
Well, if it concerns
our research,

581
00:43:20,754 --> 00:43:23,020
then it most certainly
is not a private matter.

582
00:43:23,021 --> 00:43:28,728
Lana, you were going to take a bath,
weren't you? So take your bath now.

583
00:44:08,504 --> 00:44:10,839
If we don't act
within the next 72 hours,

584
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,476
the deterioration may become
permanently irreversible.

585
00:44:13,477 --> 00:44:17,112
This antigen you've discovered
in Abigail's blood...

586
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:20,816
could possibly provoke
a fatal immune reaction.

587
00:44:20,817 --> 00:44:22,284
I'm afraid so.

588
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:24,019
Unless we can obtain
a counteragent...

589
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,021
from a subject
with a compatible blood type.

590
00:44:26,022 --> 00:44:28,358
And genetically splice the two.

591
00:44:28,359 --> 00:44:30,260
Exactly.

592
00:44:30,261 --> 00:44:32,662
The process would doubtless
be fatal to the donors,

593
00:44:32,663 --> 00:44:35,599
and there are only two people on
staff with the correct blood type...

594
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,767
The security man, Conklin,

595
00:44:37,768 --> 00:44:40,670
and, uh, Dr. Zurrell.

596
00:44:40,671 --> 00:44:43,140
Do whatever is necessary.
Anything else?

597
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:48,379
May I ask you a rather can did question?
Go ahead.

598
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:52,017
Have you given any thought to that
salary increase we talked about?

599
00:44:53,185 --> 00:44:54,819
Are you comfy?

600
00:44:55,953 --> 00:44:58,825
Yeah, well,
I love you too, baby.

601
00:45:00,358 --> 00:45:03,327
You know, I... I bet you it kind of
reminds you of L.A. in there...

602
00:45:03,328 --> 00:45:06,832
with all that slime and crap.

603
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:10,001
You're never gonna guess
who the last tenant was.

604
00:45:10,002 --> 00:45:11,570
You?

605
00:45:13,807 --> 00:45:16,809
You know,
I really love city girls.

606
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:22,015
They got some kind of, uh,
sense of humor about 'em.

607
00:45:23,617 --> 00:45:26,685
How'd you like out of there
for a while, city girl?

608
00:45:26,686 --> 00:45:29,488
I don't know.
Company's better in here.

609
00:45:29,489 --> 00:45:32,059
That's the wrong answer!

610
00:45:33,961 --> 00:45:36,596
You don't get it, do you?

611
00:45:36,597 --> 00:45:39,265
I'm trying to be nice to you.

612
00:45:39,266 --> 00:45:40,901
My mistake.

613
00:45:42,102 --> 00:45:45,071
Look, you want nice?
I can give you nice.

614
00:45:45,072 --> 00:45:47,374
Just kind of tough
from behind bars.

615
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,094
Do whatever is necessary.

616
00:46:07,095 --> 00:46:09,764
Do whatever is necessary.

617
00:46:09,765 --> 00:46:12,368
Do whatever is necessary.

618
00:46:14,403 --> 00:46:17,373
♪♪

619
00:46:30,353 --> 00:46:32,889
♪♪

620
00:47:10,895 --> 00:47:12,864
♪♪

621
00:47:12,865 --> 00:47:14,666
What is this?

622
00:47:14,667 --> 00:47:16,234
Cute, ain't he?

623
00:47:16,235 --> 00:47:19,604
Now, that's just one of
Arcane's experiments.

624
00:47:19,605 --> 00:47:22,440
You know what? Why don't you,
uh, put your hand in?

625
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:27,445
And I thought you were
up for some fun.

626
00:47:27,446 --> 00:47:30,515
Well, fun's fun, but how about
showing me something else?

627
00:47:31,151 --> 00:47:32,383
Oh.

628
00:47:32,384 --> 00:47:34,485
You want to see something else.

629
00:47:34,486 --> 00:47:35,486
Ah.

630
00:47:37,089 --> 00:47:40,091
I'm gonna show you something else.

631
00:47:40,092 --> 00:47:41,926
Hey, come on.

632
00:47:41,927 --> 00:47:43,928
Come on, baby.

633
00:47:43,929 --> 00:47:46,198
It's time to play doctor.

634
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:49,101
Bet you can't guess
my favorite operation.

635
00:47:49,102 --> 00:47:50,971
What's that, baby? A vasectomy.

636
00:47:54,675 --> 00:47:56,142
I'm gonna kill you!

637
00:47:59,246 --> 00:48:02,349
You're gonna be sorry!

638
00:48:06,187 --> 00:48:08,521
Like that, baby? Huh?

639
00:48:08,522 --> 00:48:10,957
Huh? I said did you like that?

640
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:12,959
Did you like that, baby?

641
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,528
Ten years of training
in Okinawa.

642
00:48:15,529 --> 00:48:17,030
Like that?

643
00:48:17,031 --> 00:48:19,166
Two-day vacation in East L.A.

644
00:48:19,167 --> 00:48:22,502
Where you going?
No! Don't leave me!

645
00:48:22,503 --> 00:48:24,605
We're just starting!

646
00:48:26,374 --> 00:48:28,676
Hurry up. Come on.

647
00:48:40,123 --> 00:48:41,523
Here.

648
00:48:43,792 --> 00:48:45,693
Take it.

649
00:48:45,694 --> 00:48:47,362
It's parked right outside.

650
00:48:55,139 --> 00:48:56,573
Thanks.

651
00:49:35,746 --> 00:49:38,249
That's far enough, Miss Arcane.

652
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:41,252
I figure we better go see your stepfather.
Don't you think?

653
00:49:41,253 --> 00:49:44,654
Sure. As a matter of fact,
I was just on my way up there.

654
00:49:44,655 --> 00:49:47,993
Oh, except I forgot one little thing
in the car. You wouldn't mind if I went...

655
00:49:47,994 --> 00:49:50,996
No, I didn't think you were
going to go for that one.

656
00:49:50,997 --> 00:49:54,766
You know what? When all of this is over,
I really hope we can remain friends.

657
00:49:54,767 --> 00:49:57,836
Because believe it or not,
I have really taken a liking to you two.

658
00:49:57,837 --> 00:49:59,537
No, really, I have.

659
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:00,840
You...

660
00:50:16,824 --> 00:50:18,490
Alec, how did you get here?

661
00:50:18,491 --> 00:50:20,360
Oh, you might say I was piped in.

662
00:50:20,361 --> 00:50:23,363
Now, come on. It's not gonna be easy
running that gauntlet out there.

663
00:50:23,364 --> 00:50:26,366
- Hey, why run? We got wheels.
- What?

664
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:34,241
Damn, I just love it
when guys peel out.

665
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:38,212
Activate the minefield!

666
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,514
Not bad.

667
00:51:30,701 --> 00:51:33,402
The beauty and the beast have fled.

668
00:51:33,403 --> 00:51:36,372
Our two most prized possessions.

669
00:51:39,411 --> 00:51:41,978
Oh, gross.

670
00:51:41,979 --> 00:51:43,579
Hold it.

671
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:45,649
Give me your knife.

672
00:51:49,853 --> 00:51:52,990
Looks like Holland's left us
a calling card, huh, Doc?

673
00:51:59,365 --> 00:52:00,900
Indeed he has.

674
00:52:07,806 --> 00:52:12,243
Hey, Omie, why didn't you want me to
tell those TV men about the monster?

675
00:52:12,244 --> 00:52:13,845
'Cause. 'Cause why?

676
00:52:13,846 --> 00:52:16,148
'Cause we're gonna get
a picture of it first.

677
00:52:16,149 --> 00:52:19,352
Picture? How on earth are we
ever gonna get a picture?

678
00:52:19,353 --> 00:52:23,455
Remember the camera your dad bought when
you were the sugar plum in the Christmas play?

679
00:52:23,456 --> 00:52:25,690
No, no, no, no.

680
00:52:25,691 --> 00:52:27,826
Not my dad's camera.

681
00:52:27,827 --> 00:52:29,428
You wouldn't.

682
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,862
- Good morning.
- Morning.

683
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:05,332
I slept like a baby.

684
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:06,833
Where are we?

685
00:53:07,669 --> 00:53:10,972
My place. Sorry it's so messy.

686
00:53:10,973 --> 00:53:13,174
Is there a Mrs. Swamp Thing?

687
00:53:13,175 --> 00:53:16,743
No. I'm a bachelor.
So what do you do? Order in?

688
00:53:18,379 --> 00:53:21,449
It's been a long time
since I've laughed.

689
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:24,552
Well, I seem to have that effect
on most of my boyfriends.

690
00:53:24,553 --> 00:53:27,022
Me? Your boyfriend?

691
00:53:27,023 --> 00:53:28,823
Why not?

692
00:53:28,824 --> 00:53:31,393
You said it yourself.
I'm a plant.

693
00:53:32,229 --> 00:53:34,463
That's okay. I'm a vegetarian.

694
00:53:40,903 --> 00:53:42,503
Please don't.

695
00:53:42,504 --> 00:53:44,574
This will never work, Abby.

696
00:53:45,908 --> 00:53:48,844
When I look at you,
you know what I see?

697
00:53:48,845 --> 00:53:52,581
I see the soul of
a beautiful human being.

698
00:53:52,582 --> 00:53:56,187
But I can't give you
the kind of love you want.

699
00:53:57,355 --> 00:53:58,889
Would you like to?

700
00:54:01,425 --> 00:54:03,262
What do we do?

701
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:32,355
Was it real?

702
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,691
As real as you want it to be.

703
00:55:45,168 --> 00:55:46,934
Bad news, sir.

704
00:55:46,935 --> 00:55:50,539
We found the vehicle, but there was no
sign of Swamp Thing or your stepdaughter.

705
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:53,175
Well, I'll tell you
the bad news.

706
00:55:53,176 --> 00:55:55,678
If you don't find
Abigail and Holland,

707
00:55:55,679 --> 00:55:58,213
there'll be no sign of you either.

708
00:55:58,214 --> 00:56:01,416
So think fast, and don't come back
until you've found both of them.

709
00:56:01,417 --> 00:56:03,487
Go.Yes, sir.

710
00:56:09,194 --> 00:56:11,694
Gigi.

711
00:56:11,695 --> 00:56:14,130
Am I a fool without a mind?

712
00:56:14,131 --> 00:56:18,701
Or have I merely been too blind to realize
that I'm dealing with two idiots?

713
00:56:18,702 --> 00:56:21,205
Yes, sir.

714
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:41,227
She'd look great with fins.

715
00:56:41,228 --> 00:56:43,994
And maybe flippers.

716
00:56:43,995 --> 00:56:47,366
Yes. Definitely flippers.

717
00:56:53,873 --> 00:56:55,874
Doing a little homework,
are we, Doctor?

718
00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:59,479
Yes, yes, um, always thinking
of the next experiment.

719
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,147
You're working far too hard.

720
00:57:01,148 --> 00:57:02,482
Well, excellence is the...

721
00:57:02,483 --> 00:57:04,917
Is that one of our security men?

722
00:57:04,918 --> 00:57:06,754
Yes. Yes, it is.

723
00:57:06,755 --> 00:57:08,920
An emergency transfusion
for Dr. Arcane.

724
00:57:08,921 --> 00:57:12,459
I have something very special
in mind for Mr. Conklin there.

725
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,827
I've even prepared
a special cage for him.

726
00:57:14,828 --> 00:57:16,897
Really? Yes.

727
00:57:16,898 --> 00:57:20,300
Believe me, it exceeds anything
we've attempted thus far.

728
00:57:20,301 --> 00:57:23,871
I've developed a Pyridoxine
hydrochloric emulsion...

729
00:57:23,872 --> 00:57:26,106
that, when combined with
a human pituitary extract,

730
00:57:26,107 --> 00:57:28,741
will produce a nearly spontaneous
super-developed mutation.

731
00:57:28,742 --> 00:57:31,445
Yes, but aren't you risking
cranial hypertrophy?

732
00:57:31,446 --> 00:57:33,747
Nothing wrong with that.

733
00:57:33,748 --> 00:57:35,483
Mmm. After you.

734
00:57:35,484 --> 00:57:40,721
Now, you'll notice on the inside here,
up at the top, I've, uh...

735
00:57:40,722 --> 00:57:42,956
I've put some additional
support in there.

736
00:57:42,957 --> 00:57:44,959
Hey, hey! What are you doing?

737
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,028
Ow! That hurt.

738
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:08,352
Omie.

739
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,654
Omie?

740
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:14,224
Omie, we gotta stop.

741
00:58:15,092 --> 00:58:18,094
Omie, I gotta stop.

742
00:58:18,095 --> 00:58:20,230
You ain't hungry again, are ya?

743
00:58:20,231 --> 00:58:24,300
Five minutes. Five minutes.
That's all I ask.

744
00:58:24,301 --> 00:58:26,803
Last five minutes
turned into a half an hour.

745
00:58:26,804 --> 00:58:29,973
We gotta move.
We've been moving all day.

746
00:58:29,974 --> 00:58:34,444
Well, we ain't gonna make no $10,000
while you sit around feeding your face.

747
00:58:34,445 --> 00:58:36,447
How do you know
The National Spectator...

748
00:58:36,448 --> 00:58:39,851
is gonna pay 10 bills
for any stupid picture?

749
00:58:39,852 --> 00:58:43,554
Hell, man, I saw where they paid
a dude from Spokane two times that...

750
00:58:43,555 --> 00:58:45,690
for a picture of Bigfoot.

751
00:58:45,691 --> 00:58:49,427
Yeah, but Bigfoot's
more famous than this guy.

752
00:58:50,664 --> 00:58:52,664
Just come on, okay?

753
00:58:56,770 --> 00:59:01,106
Good grief, I could be
home watching cable.

754
00:59:01,807 --> 00:59:03,877
Oops.

755
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:14,752
Once this was a huge plantation
worked by hundreds of slaves.

756
00:59:14,753 --> 00:59:17,890
Some people say their unhappy
ghosts still walk here.

757
00:59:17,891 --> 00:59:21,293
I can't imagine anyone being unhappy
in a beautiful place like this.

758
00:59:22,862 --> 00:59:24,863
For a long time,

759
00:59:24,864 --> 00:59:27,734
I've felt that I would
always be unhappy here.

760
00:59:44,085 --> 00:59:47,287
Give me one of them Ho Ho's
before you eat 'em all up.

761
00:59:47,288 --> 00:59:49,756
Out of Ho Ho's. Twinkies?

762
00:59:49,757 --> 00:59:50,925
Nope.

763
00:59:50,926 --> 00:59:53,226
- Snowballs?
- Nope.

764
00:59:53,227 --> 00:59:55,630
- Ding Dongs?
- Sorry.

765
00:59:55,631 --> 00:59:57,797
- Pudding pies?
- Uh-uh.

766
00:59:57,798 --> 00:59:59,334
What have we got left?

767
01:00:06,307 --> 01:00:07,776
Got two apples.

768
01:00:07,777 --> 01:00:09,678
Apples? Oh, man.

769
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,313
Hey, butt-head.

770
01:00:12,314 --> 01:00:14,515
That's my dad's camera.

771
01:00:14,516 --> 01:00:16,250
What about my dad's
bowling ball?

772
01:00:16,251 --> 01:00:18,085
That was different.

773
01:00:18,086 --> 01:00:20,823
- Oh, yeah? Well, what was so different about it?
- I don't know.

774
01:00:20,824 --> 01:00:22,791
It's just different.

775
01:00:22,792 --> 01:00:24,293
What was that?

776
01:00:24,294 --> 01:00:26,028
I don't know. Neither do I.

777
01:00:26,029 --> 01:00:28,263
- What do you think it was?
- I don't know.

778
01:00:28,264 --> 01:00:29,998
Neither do I.

779
01:00:29,999 --> 01:00:31,700
Better check it out.

780
01:00:31,701 --> 01:00:34,170
I take the pictures,
so you check it out.

781
01:00:34,171 --> 01:00:36,172
I'm not checking it out.

782
01:00:36,173 --> 01:00:38,207
What's the matter?
You chicken or something?

783
01:00:39,809 --> 01:00:41,844
Well, I...

784
01:00:41,845 --> 01:00:44,482
Just check it out.
Check it out. Go on.

785
01:00:44,483 --> 01:00:47,485
Are you sure it's safe?
You never feel safe about anything.

786
01:00:47,486 --> 01:00:49,053
Will you just go?

787
01:00:52,022 --> 01:00:53,823
What if somebody gets me?

788
01:00:53,824 --> 01:00:56,027
Don't worry. I assure you,
nobody wants you.

789
01:00:56,028 --> 01:00:57,427
Now go on.

790
01:00:57,428 --> 01:00:59,063
My mother wants me.

791
01:00:59,764 --> 01:01:00,764
Go.

792
01:01:15,247 --> 01:01:18,650
You jerk. There's no one...

793
01:01:26,926 --> 01:01:29,162
Here.

794
01:01:40,707 --> 01:01:43,876
Oh. I haven't been given a
flower since my senior prom.

795
01:01:43,877 --> 01:01:46,614
It was wilted.

796
01:01:48,882 --> 01:01:50,850
Help! Sounds like children.

797
01:01:50,851 --> 01:01:52,986
Get your hands off me, you big...
Wait here.

798
01:01:52,987 --> 01:01:55,756
Help! You don't own this swamp!

799
01:01:55,757 --> 01:01:58,490
Let go of me, you big gorilla!

800
01:01:58,491 --> 01:02:01,227
Help! Help!

801
01:02:01,228 --> 01:02:04,064
Let me go.

802
01:02:04,065 --> 01:02:07,233
Aha!

803
01:02:07,234 --> 01:02:09,235
Hey, that's
a pretty good apple, kid.

804
01:02:09,236 --> 01:02:11,237
What else you got?

805
01:02:13,241 --> 01:02:15,109
Oh, yeah, man.

806
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:17,077
It's a good camera.
It's expensive too.

807
01:02:17,078 --> 01:02:18,746
You can have it.

808
01:02:18,747 --> 01:02:22,283
No, they can't. It's my dad's.

809
01:02:26,622 --> 01:02:28,155
Now, son,

810
01:02:28,156 --> 01:02:30,125
this was your dad's.

811
01:02:30,126 --> 01:02:32,994
But now it's mine.

812
01:02:32,995 --> 01:02:35,830
So that means
you'll let us go. Right?

813
01:02:35,831 --> 01:02:37,601
Wrong.

814
01:02:38,201 --> 01:02:40,303
- Right.
- What?

815
01:02:41,103 --> 01:02:43,507
Get the camera!

816
01:02:46,844 --> 01:02:49,445
Wow! Swamp Thing's
kicking some butt!

817
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,517
Wow.

818
01:02:55,518 --> 01:02:57,486
Come on!

819
01:03:01,024 --> 01:03:02,626
I believe this is yours.

820
01:03:02,627 --> 01:03:05,629
Hey, big guy.
Mind if we take your picture?

821
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:08,498
It's just for a...
science project.

822
01:03:08,499 --> 01:03:10,466
Yeah, that's the ticket.

823
01:03:10,467 --> 01:03:13,102
All right, but only if your
friend there stands next to me.

824
01:03:13,103 --> 01:03:15,405
Sure. No problem.
Get over there.

825
01:03:15,406 --> 01:03:16,807
Go on. Go.

826
01:03:16,808 --> 01:03:18,542
Me? Yeah, you.

827
01:03:18,543 --> 01:03:20,344
Go on. Get over there. Now.

828
01:03:20,345 --> 01:03:22,680
$10,000.

829
01:03:39,932 --> 01:03:43,168
Okay. Smile.

830
01:03:43,169 --> 01:03:45,737
Uh, you'll need tore
move that lens cap.

831
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:48,909
Oh, yeah. That's why
it was so dark. Okeydokey.

832
01:03:57,318 --> 01:03:58,853
Alec?

833
01:03:59,921 --> 01:04:01,455
Alec?

834
01:04:07,195 --> 01:04:09,896
Hey! Green guy!

835
01:04:09,897 --> 01:04:11,532
Where you going?

836
01:04:13,534 --> 01:04:15,369
Abby?

837
01:04:18,339 --> 01:04:21,442
Come back here.
This is $10,000 to me! Please!

838
01:04:55,011 --> 01:04:56,613
Abby.

839
01:05:10,161 --> 01:05:13,865
We should definitely
expect company.

840
01:05:13,866 --> 01:05:18,501
And we will receive them with
our customary hospitality.

841
01:05:18,502 --> 01:05:20,338
Exactly.

842
01:05:25,476 --> 01:05:29,013
You must have had
a very hectic day.

843
01:05:29,014 --> 01:05:31,015
It wasn't my fault.

844
01:05:31,016 --> 01:05:33,251
We've set up sensors
all around the property.

845
01:05:33,252 --> 01:05:36,254
If anything breaks through those
beams, we're gonna know about it.

846
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:39,657
Good. Have you located
Dr. Rochelle yet?

847
01:05:39,658 --> 01:05:42,861
According to security
he's still on the property.

848
01:05:42,862 --> 01:05:44,863
But no one's seen him yet.

849
01:05:44,864 --> 01:05:46,865
We need him for the operation.

850
01:05:46,866 --> 01:05:49,935
Don't worry, darling. I'm fully capable
of carrying on without the doctor.

851
01:05:49,936 --> 01:05:51,770
Of course you are. Naturally.

852
01:05:51,771 --> 01:05:54,672
Begin the preparations.
I'll join you in a moment.

853
01:05:54,673 --> 01:05:56,242
Certainly.

854
01:05:58,444 --> 01:06:01,014
Find Rochelle.

855
01:06:01,015 --> 01:06:03,383
10-4, Doc.

856
01:06:11,391 --> 01:06:13,725
We're not going to
find Rochelle here.

857
01:06:13,726 --> 01:06:16,896
Let's find him on the TV.
How do you work these gizmos?

858
01:06:16,897 --> 01:06:19,899
Gunn, your ignorance is only
exceeded by your incompetence.

859
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:23,037
Well, thanks, Points.
And I always thought you hated me.

860
01:06:23,038 --> 01:06:25,472
I don't hate you. I despise you.

861
01:06:25,473 --> 01:06:27,474
How can you say that?

862
01:06:27,475 --> 01:06:29,977
I've always been what
you'd call a likable guy...

863
01:06:29,978 --> 01:06:33,080
when I'm not blowing somebody away.

864
01:06:33,081 --> 01:06:36,350
You're supposed to be the head of security
around here, right? Right. Yeah.

865
01:06:36,351 --> 01:06:38,519
Well, great. Let's recap.

866
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:41,055
Where's Swamp Thing?
I don't know.

867
01:06:41,056 --> 01:06:42,690
Where's Arcane's stepdaughter?

868
01:06:42,691 --> 01:06:43,858
Is she missing again?

869
01:06:43,859 --> 01:06:45,725
Where's Dr. Rochelle?

870
01:06:45,726 --> 01:06:47,762
I don't know. Where?

871
01:06:47,763 --> 01:06:49,331
I rest my case.

872
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:56,036
Help me.

873
01:06:56,037 --> 01:06:59,039
Oh, I'm sorry. I can't.
There's nothing I can do.

874
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:00,842
There's simply no escape.

875
01:07:00,843 --> 01:07:03,145
He killed my mother, didn't he?

876
01:07:03,146 --> 01:07:04,881
No. Rochelle did.

877
01:07:04,882 --> 01:07:06,548
I-It was a mistake.

878
01:07:06,549 --> 01:07:08,550
Your mother was to supply
the genetic code...

879
01:07:08,551 --> 01:07:11,019
that your stepfather
needed to cheat death.

880
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:12,255
Did he hate her that much?

881
01:07:12,256 --> 01:07:14,756
No. To the contrary. He worshipped her.

882
01:07:14,757 --> 01:07:17,759
So much so that I couldn't get
close enough to him because...

883
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,331
Because he couldn't
let go of her memory.

884
01:07:25,436 --> 01:07:27,938
Alec will never come after me.

885
01:07:30,241 --> 01:07:32,842
If I'm a judge of character,
he will.

886
01:07:32,843 --> 01:07:36,213
You two get along extremely well.
It's a good thing.

887
01:07:36,214 --> 01:07:39,782
Soon you'll be very close
to each other. Very close indeed.

888
01:07:39,783 --> 01:07:42,819
Let me explain. Genes.
The fundamentals.

889
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:46,724
Yours, Holland's coupled.

890
01:07:46,725 --> 01:07:51,329
And man's oldest dream
may come true.

891
01:07:51,896 --> 01:07:53,364
Immortality.

892
01:07:53,365 --> 01:07:54,832
You're sick.

893
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:57,002
What did you do?
Sell your soul to the devil?

894
01:07:57,003 --> 01:08:00,672
Let's just say he has a lease
with an option to buy.

895
01:08:00,673 --> 01:08:04,308
Hey, hey. Now, wait a second. I got my people
out there tracking 'em down right now.

896
01:08:04,309 --> 01:08:07,312
They're gonna find them,
I'm gonna finish 'em.

897
01:08:07,313 --> 01:08:09,313
No, Gunn, you're the one
who's finished.

898
01:08:09,314 --> 01:08:11,984
By tomorrow, I'll have your job.

899
01:08:11,985 --> 01:08:13,685
No way, Points.

900
01:08:13,686 --> 01:08:17,721
You try to take my job, all you're gonna
get is a scar from there to there.

901
01:08:17,722 --> 01:08:20,125
You don't scare me.

902
01:08:20,126 --> 01:08:24,529
The guy that did this to me?
I got his job too.

903
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:26,299
That's a nasty scar.

904
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:29,035
But that's nothing
compared to this.

905
01:08:29,036 --> 01:08:32,705
Grenada. 1983. Friendly fire.

906
01:08:32,706 --> 01:08:34,174
That's bush compared to this.

907
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:37,343
Falkland Islands, 1982.
Shrapnel.

908
01:08:37,344 --> 01:08:40,214
Nicaragua. Spring break, '86.

909
01:08:40,215 --> 01:08:42,716
Beirut. Summer vacation, '87.

910
01:08:42,717 --> 01:08:45,118
Cindy, 1967.

911
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:47,721
Haight-Ashbury,
the summer of love.

912
01:08:47,722 --> 01:08:51,191
Motley Cru♪♪e tour, 1988.

913
01:08:51,192 --> 01:08:54,262
That kinda turns me on.

914
01:08:55,763 --> 01:08:57,731
Excuse me.

915
01:08:57,732 --> 01:09:02,204
Doesn't anybody knock
around here?

916
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:12,047
Knock-knock.

917
01:09:19,722 --> 01:09:23,994
Lana, put the Holland specimen
in the receptor.

918
01:09:26,030 --> 01:09:27,830
Holland's on his way, sir.

919
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:29,298
Stop him.

920
01:09:29,299 --> 01:09:31,699
Why don't you use those?
They're a by-product of Agent Orange.

921
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,701
Beggin' your pardon, Doc.

922
01:09:33,702 --> 01:09:36,139
This stuff is for nancy boys.

923
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:37,940
Besides...

924
01:09:37,941 --> 01:09:40,677
I got my own toys.

925
01:09:41,845 --> 01:09:44,147
Think about what you're doing.

926
01:09:44,148 --> 01:09:45,549
I am.

927
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:48,984
You're about to experience
a unique feeling.

928
01:09:48,985 --> 01:09:52,756
You're going to be part
of what gives life.

929
01:09:52,757 --> 01:09:54,024
To you.

930
01:09:54,025 --> 01:09:56,525
To me. It's for a good cause.

931
01:10:09,908 --> 01:10:11,443
Psst!

932
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:20,486
Hey, buddy. Got a light?

933
01:10:28,727 --> 01:10:30,261
This is too easy.

934
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:55,188
Good.

935
01:10:56,357 --> 01:10:57,891
Good!

936
01:11:00,261 --> 01:11:01,796
Energy.

937
01:11:02,863 --> 01:11:05,398
Energy.

938
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,680
Increase the dosage.

939
01:11:20,681 --> 01:11:22,284
Increase the dosage!

940
01:11:37,667 --> 01:11:40,135
How beautiful.

941
01:11:40,136 --> 01:11:42,171
Dosage up by 2 cc's.

942
01:11:42,172 --> 01:11:44,673
Temperature holding at 98.2.

943
01:11:44,674 --> 01:11:46,341
Heartbeat at 98.

944
01:11:46,342 --> 01:11:49,245
Patience. Patience!

945
01:12:13,571 --> 01:12:17,007
I've got you now,
Mr. Potato Head!

946
01:12:46,138 --> 01:12:47,640
I like it.

947
01:12:48,608 --> 01:12:50,644
I like it very much.

948
01:12:52,078 --> 01:12:53,446
Not bad.

949
01:12:53,447 --> 01:12:55,313
Enormous improvement.

950
01:12:55,314 --> 01:12:57,615
I... I feel 25.

951
01:12:57,616 --> 01:12:59,053
Not bad at all.

952
01:13:05,191 --> 01:13:06,393
What's that?

953
01:13:17,204 --> 01:13:18,283
311, 459.

954
01:13:22,776 --> 01:13:24,578
You switched the vials.

955
01:13:25,513 --> 01:13:27,582
You switched the vials.

956
01:13:29,650 --> 01:13:31,351
Lana, I'm not mad.

957
01:13:31,352 --> 01:13:33,887
I don't want to get even.

958
01:13:33,888 --> 01:13:36,556
Your life, Abby's life, my life.

959
01:13:36,557 --> 01:13:39,226
It's not important.

960
01:13:39,227 --> 01:13:41,796
Our work is all important.

961
01:13:42,763 --> 01:13:44,266
And you betrayed it.

962
01:13:44,267 --> 01:13:46,934
Hmm?

963
01:13:46,935 --> 01:13:49,803
Lana, you betrayed it.

964
01:13:49,804 --> 01:13:51,973
Lana.

965
01:13:54,542 --> 01:13:57,379
Laughter is best, isn't it?

966
01:14:18,802 --> 01:14:20,839
God will pardon me.

967
01:14:22,373 --> 01:14:24,409
That's his job.

968
01:15:56,940 --> 01:15:59,407
Your attention, please.

969
01:15:59,408 --> 01:16:01,509
Disintegrator on overload.

970
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:04,279
Self-destruct in three minutes.

971
01:16:19,162 --> 01:16:20,864
Abby.

972
01:16:34,178 --> 01:16:36,447
Two minutes till self-destruct.

973
01:16:37,415 --> 01:16:39,516
What's new, Jolly Green Giant?

974
01:16:41,787 --> 01:16:44,454
Time for a little mixed
vegetable plate, huh?

975
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:50,661
Too bad, spinach man.

976
01:16:50,662 --> 01:16:54,464
You'll never get to know her
like me and the boys.

977
01:16:59,338 --> 01:17:02,007
Oh, shit, man.

978
01:17:16,255 --> 01:17:19,459
One minute till self-destruct.

979
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:47,221
Thirty seconds till self-destruct.

980
01:20:08,503 --> 01:20:10,337
Alec.

981
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:13,073
You brought me back, didn't you?

982
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:15,343
I couldn't lose you.

983
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:17,745
How do you feel?

984
01:20:18,813 --> 01:20:20,614
Good as new.

985
01:20:23,719 --> 01:20:24,985
Got it.

986
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:27,386
Come on. Let's get out
of here. Just one more.

987
01:20:27,387 --> 01:20:29,256
Come on.
They're kissin' and stuff.

988
01:20:29,257 --> 01:20:31,693
Besides, the Fotomat
opens in 10 minutes.

989
01:20:31,694 --> 01:20:33,795
I'm gonna get me a Corvette.

990
01:20:33,796 --> 01:20:35,196
What about me?

991
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:37,498
Get your own Corvette. Come on.

992
01:20:39,235 --> 01:20:42,469
You know, Abby,
there may be side effects.

993
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:43,806
Like what?

994
01:20:43,807 --> 01:20:45,273
I don't know yet.

995
01:20:45,274 --> 01:20:48,712
Well, we'll just have to
discover them together.

996
01:20:50,347 --> 01:20:54,315
Or are you firmly attached to
this swinging bachelor lifestyle?

997
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:55,718
Not necessarily.

998
01:22:37,425 --> 01:22:40,261
What do you mean, you didn't
put film in the camera?

999
01:22:40,262 --> 01:22:41,761
Me? You're the photographer.

1000
01:22:41,762 --> 01:22:43,264
Yeah, but it's your camera.

1001
01:22:43,265 --> 01:22:45,599
Who said I had to load it?

1002
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,101
I did! Did not.

1003
01:22:47,102 --> 01:22:50,104
Did too. You probably had a
Twinkie in your ear or somethin'.

1004
01:22:50,105 --> 01:22:51,772
Shut up, Omie. No, you shut up.

1005
01:22:51,773 --> 01:22:53,274
You shut up!

1006
01:22:53,275 --> 01:22:55,009
You wanna make somethin' of it?
Yeah!

1007
01:22:55,010 --> 01:22:57,612
It'll be two hits...
I hit you and you hit the floor.

1008
01:22:57,613 --> 01:23:00,114
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
Come on. I really don't care.

1009
01:23:00,115 --> 01:23:02,784

my friend as it is.
