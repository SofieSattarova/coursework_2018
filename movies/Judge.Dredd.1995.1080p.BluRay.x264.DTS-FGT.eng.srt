1
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,979
Ferguson, Herman.

2
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:18,864
6 month sentence at Aspen served. Welcome
back, citizen. Your living assignment:

3
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:22,492
Y-block, Heavenly Haven, red quad.
Move on! Come on!

4
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,689
Welcome home.

5
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,970
That's it! I think that's Heavenly Haven!

6
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,231
Better than prison.

7
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,359
Jesus Christ!

8
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:04,696
Eat recycled food for a happier life!

9
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,324
Be kind and peaceful to each other.

10
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:14,122
Eat recycled food. It's good
for the environment and OK for you.

11
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,964
Hey, look what I got!

12
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,676
A little cupcake.

13
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:32,057
What have we got here?
You a Judge spy, little man?

14
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:35,352
Me a spy? This guy, he's funny!

15
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,190
No. I live here! I mean I'll live here.

16
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:43,235
If I live. Maybe I should go to a hotel.

17
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,115
No way, man! Don't you hear 'em out there?
It's block war, man!

18
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,331
Block war. Block war!

19
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:26,278
Like an academy simulation, right down
to the cross fire! I lead off, you follow.

20
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:30,449
This is no sim, rookie!
You will stand down and wait for backup!

21
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:36,538
Hershey and Brisco in position!
We're under fire from the upper floors.

22
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,294
Inside Heavenly Haven. Request backup!
Level Y, yellow, repeat! Nearest Judge!

23
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,417
Holly crud!

24
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,670
He knows what he's doing.

25
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,427
I am the law!

26
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,474
Drop your weapons!

27
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:43,313
These blocks are under arrest!

28
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,860
This is your final warning!

29
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,862
Judge Dredd!

30
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:54,449
Hey! You wanna be afraid of somebody?
Be afraid of me!

31
00:08:54,867 --> 00:09:00,163
I got it! Why don't I run down there
and surrender? Sorta throw him off guard?

32
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,835
Bad idea.
- Hey, Dredd! Come and get us!

33
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:15,136
I knew they'd do that.
- Take cover!

34
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:20,100
They're firing 20 millimeter
caseless flechet rounds at 300 meters.

35
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:23,353
The effective lethal range is 200 meters.

36
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,313
You're safe!

37
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,817
What are you doing there, Judge Hershey?

38
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,945
Waiting for backup.

39
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,865
It's here.

40
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:41,413
Move it out! Keep it simple,
single file, standard relay, I'm point.

41
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:42,914
You're last.

42
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,294
Grenade!

43
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:57,178
Meet me on the 40th!
- Hey, get some more ammo!

44
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:01,099
Be kind and peaceful to each other.
Eat recycled food.

45
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,854
Hey, you guys with us?
- Yeah!

46
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,315
All right!
- Move out!

47
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,210
This room has been pacified.
- Next one's mine!

48
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,545
No!

49
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,632
This room is under arrest.

50
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,301
No!

51
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,560
You're under arrest! Throw down
your weapons, be prepared to be judged!

52
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,939
Judge this! Lawgiver man!
- No! Don't, they're booby trapped!

53
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,657
Holy drock!
- Auto rapid fire. Armor piercing!

54
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,130
Drop dead, Dredd!

55
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,676
Double whammy.

56
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:29,312
Mega City Municipal code 2-13,
willful destruction of property. 2 years.

57
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,982
Code 3-10, illegal possession
of assault weapons. 5 years.

58
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,695
Code 4-57, resisting arrest, 20 years!

59
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,706
And code 36-13.
The first degree murder of a Street Judge.

60
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,379
Let me guess. Life.

61
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,718
Death.

62
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,181
Court's adjourned.

63
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,230
53 hospitalized. 5 ofthem children.
19 dead.

64
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:23,158
Damn it!
I'm supposed to be watchin' out for him.

65
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,246
Don't blame yourself, Hershey.
He made the mistake, not you.

66
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,625
Wouldn't it feel good to have an emotion?

67
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,962
Emotions.
There outta be a law against them.

68
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,509
Halt!

69
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:51,186
You have 5 seconds to surrender!
- Dredd, it's just a servadroid.

70
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,731
Five, four, three, two, one!

71
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,946
Boy, am I glad to see you!

72
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:06,117
Mega City Municipal Code 75-92.
Willful sabotage of a public droid.

73
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,329
That's 6 months, citizen. Your Unicard!

74
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,999
Come on, give me a break, Judge Dredd.
Dredd? Holly God!

75
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:20,381
H. Ferguson, hacker. Illegal tampering of
droids, computers, cash machines, taxis.

76
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,967
And not even out of jail for 24 hours.

77
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:28,097
He's habitual. Automatic 5 year sentence. How do you plead?
- No guilty?

78
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,267
I knew you'd say that.
- 5 years?

79
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:36,189
I had no choice! They killed each other!
- You coulda gone out the window.

80
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,399
40 floors? It woulda been suicide!

81
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,486
Maybe! But it's legal.

82
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:46,282
Judges! Five years, Aspen Penitentiary!
Case closed. Take him away!

83
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,911
Don't close the case!
You're misjudging me! Open the case!

84
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:58,211
And if he told the truth? Never heard
ofextenuating circumstances?

85
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,548
I've heard it all, Hershey.

86
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,384
I knew you'd say that.

87
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,433
My fellow Judges,
have we forgotten the lessons of history?

88
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,646
However quickly
these block wars can be contained,

89
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,316
it's clear: They're becoming an epidemic!

90
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:25,655
We should deal with it at once. A tougher
criminal code is the only solution!

91
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:33,538
Our situation gets worse every day.
73 citizen riots in 16 different sectors

92
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:37,709
in the last two months alone!
- Violent crime is rising at 15 percent

93
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:42,839
every quarter! Lfwe don't increase
our resources, they will be inadequate.

94
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:47,093
In less than three years.
- Three years? They are inadequate now!

95
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:52,473
My fellow council members. As a city,
we continue to grow. Growth is painful.

96
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,147
65 million people living in an area
designed for no more than 20!

97
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:05,945
It's not enough that they rely on us
for food, clothes, water, for clean air.

98
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:11,117
Chief Justice. The city is in chaos!
For social order we need tighter reins!

99
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,413
Incarceration didn't work as a deterrent.

100
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,958
I say we expand execution
to include lesser crimes!

101
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:25,840
My fellow Judges. I was barely in my teens
when I put on this badge.

102
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:32,180
When it comes time for me to take it off,
please, let me do so knowing

103
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,392
that it still stands for freedom.
And not for repression.

104
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:43,858
53 hospitalized. 19 dead!
4 ofthem killed by a gang of squatters,

105
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,197
who were themselves killed
in summary executions by Judge Dredd.

106
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:55,286
As my special report continues I take you
behind the scenes ofthe halls ofJustice.

107
00:15:55,371 --> 00:16:00,625
With a probe into these recent riots
and block wars. Coincidence or deliberate?

108
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,130
Dredd?

109
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,647
Joseph.
- Chief Justice Fargo.

110
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,859
You may stand at ease, Joseph.

111
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:38,329
So tell me, seven summary executions?
Were they necessary?

112
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,293
Unavoidable, sir.
- Unavoidable.

113
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:50,091
Life doesn't mean much to some people
any more. You'd see that if you weren'tâ€¦

114
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:53,636
If I weren't what?
- Always at the Academy, sir.

115
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:58,016
Oh, don't you mean
at the Academy wiping cadets' asses?

116
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:06,024
That's what they say in the squad room.
- It's irrelevant. You set the standards.

117
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:10,695
Well, now you do. Well, at least
to many young cadets you're a legend.

118
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,699
Sir.

119
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:20,246
You remember your days as a cadet, Joseph?
- I remember what you taught me, sir.

120
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,875
You were my finest student.

121
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,753
So I got a new assignment for you.

122
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:30,923
Starting tomorrow, you're going to spend
two days a week at the Academy.

123
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:35,094
I'd be honored, sir. Unarmed combat or marksmanship?
- Ethics.

124
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,928
Remain still. Identify yourself.
- Miller. Warden.

125
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,766
Voice sample recognized.
Thank you, Warden.

126
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,646
So why are you here?
You come for another chat?

127
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,316
Just a short one, I'm afraid. Duty calls.

128
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,487
Ah, duty. Feeding these parasites here?
At the public's expense?

129
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,369
Yeah. You especially.

130
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,915
I don't cost anything! I'm a ghost.

131
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,838
And we're both prisoners here.

132
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:55,174
You're behind your desk.
And I'm behind this.

133
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:01,806
What a clever reward from Fargo.
I mean considering the services.

134
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:09,605
When you started killing innocent people,
Rico, you went beyond service.

135
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:15,820
The innocent exist only until inevitably
they become perpetrators. Like you.

136
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,868
Guilt and innocence is a matter oftiming.

137
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,999
Your, our mysterious benefactor
has sent you a package.

138
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,927
Deactivate shield. Auto guns only.

139
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,859
What is that?
- That's an ancient puzzle

140
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,821
that contains the meaning of life.

141
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,247
So tell me, Rico.
What is the meaning of life?

142
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,921
It ends!

143
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,763
Activate alarm!

144
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:28,017
Voice not recognized. Guns are training.

145
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,853
No!

146
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,527
Secure good! Three, one, two. Come on!

147
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:02,760
Kevlar-9-helmet and body armor.
Yours when you graduate.

148
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:11,936
Lawgiver 2. 25 rounds of side arm
with variable voice programmed ammunition.

149
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,898
Signal flare! Yours if you graduate.

150
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:26,033
Mark-4-Lawmaster, improved model.
With dual on-board laser canons,

151
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:31,914
vertical take-off and landing flight
capabilities. Range: 500 kilometers. Men?

152
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,042
Yes, sir.

153
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:50,182
Yours if you can ever get it to work.

154
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,938
All ofthese things you see here are toys.

155
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,608
At the end ofthe day.
When you're all alone in the dark.

156
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,487
The only thing that counts is this.

157
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,866
The law.

158
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:11,037
And you will be alone
when you swear to uphold these ideals.

159
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,417
For most of us is death on the streets.

160
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:21,922
For the few of us who survived to old age.
The proud loneliness ofthe Long Walk.

161
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,928
A walk that every Judge must take
outside these city walls.

162
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:34,435
Into the unknown ofthe Cursed Earth.
And these spend your last remaining days

163
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,025
taking law to the lawless.
This is what it means to be a Judge.

164
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,990
This is the commitment I expect.

165
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,412
Class dismissed.

166
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,807
I can hear you thinking.

167
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:17,686
I caught your lecture today. You think
the cadets really need to hear that?

168
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,981
I told them the truth.
- Your truth maybe.

169
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,776
You made it sound like our lives are over!

170
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,987
Don't you think ours are, Hershey?

171
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,198
I have a personal life. I have friends.

172
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:34,286
You're the smartest one ofthe new breed.
You've only been on the street a year.

173
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:37,623
You haven't gotten use
to the isolation yet.

174
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,753
No. I don't think that's right.

175
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,257
No one is supposed to be always alone.

176
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:51,929
Is that really been what it's been
like for you? Have you never had a friend?

177
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,726
Yes. One.

178
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,189
What happened?

179
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,945
Dredd! Wait. I want to know.
What happened?

180
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,868
I judged him.

181
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:28,132
2 loads from the prison factory in hold 1.

182
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,918
We're closed for the night.

183
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:51,423
You're holding a package for me.
The code name is Lazarus.

184
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:55,135
I'll just be a second.

185
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,809
You got a nice place.

186
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,520
Yeah. A lot ofthis is antiques.

187
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:09,650
That's funny. I thought they destroyed
all these ABC Warriors during the war?

188
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:13,904
Well, you can still collect 'em.
As long as they're non-functioning.

189
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,156
Like my wife.

190
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:19,660
Yeah, these must be 50 or 60 years old.
Anyway.

191
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,040
There you go.

192
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,259
Hey, wait a second! Don't touch it!

193
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,928
Why is that?
- Why it's a Lawgiver.

194
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:43,058
That's programmed to only recognize
a Judge's hand. It'll take your arm off!

195
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:49,023
Gee. How do you like that?
I must be a Judge.

196
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,726
Happy Birthday.

197
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,199
Status?

198
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,665
How 'bout bodyguard.

199
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,668
Commander?
- Rico.

200
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:54,296
Mission?
- Mission?

201
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:57,466
We're going to war.

202
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,551
War.

203
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:07,434
I followed up some grumblings
confirming a suspicion of mine.

204
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:13,273
The cancer of oppression goes far deeper.
- You're going to say that over the air?

205
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,860
It's the truth.
- Vardis, you're insane. I'm a reporter.

206
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:21,990
They'll never let this get on to the air.
This could bring down the Council.

207
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:28,122
Maybe it should. The whole system
is the problem. Not just Judge Dredd? No!

208
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:53,522
OK, baby, up we go.
OK, hang on to your seat, cuz here we go!

209
00:28:56,192 --> 00:29:00,154
Step outta the car, please.
- What the hell's the problem now?

210
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,365
Get outta the car! Unicard, please!

211
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,829
Did you hear me? Unicard!

212
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:16,420
Mr. Susa. You have a suspended license.
3 counts of driving under the influence.

213
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:21,425
Hey! You better listen! I suggest
you walk away and bother somebody else!

214
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:24,720
I have powerful friends, I mean powerful!

215
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:28,974
Are we having a problem here, Hershey?
- Not at all. Nothing that I can't handle.

216
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:33,687
Suspended license. Three DUls.
- That's getting boring. What's the tab?

217
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,609
How much? You name your price.

218
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,447
Hershey, call control for an H-wagon.
- What? You're gonna tow me?

219
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:49,745
Towing iffor a first violation. That's
your 4th, bar breath. How do you plead?

220
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:52,998
Not guilty.
- I knew you'd say that.

221
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,710
Hey, wait a second. What are you doing?
- Grenade. - No!

222
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:05,803
Happy motoring.

223
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,058
Subtle.

224
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,478
Judge Joseph Dredd!

225
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:20,734
Dredd. You're under arrest.
- What's the charge?

226
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,403
Murder.

227
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:45,425
Joseph.
- Sir?

228
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,847
Is it true?
- I'm innocent.

229
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:55,853
The Council's said to have irrefutable proof.
- You believe that?

230
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,773
Let there be a full tribunal.

231
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:03,485
Do you believe that, sir?

232
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:14,413
I just needed to look into your eyes
for myself. I'm sorry I asked.

233
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:19,543
I would never do anything to disgrace you.

234
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:23,255
I'll use every resource to find out.

235
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:31,346
Have you selected someone to defend you?
- Judge Hershey. - Why Hershey?

236
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:36,560
At the Academy she was at the top
of her class in interpretation ofthe law.

237
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:39,354
And I trust her.

238
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:44,568
The facts will come out at the tribunal.
I'll personally make sure ofthat.

239
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,862
Sir?

240
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,074
I'm sorry about this.

241
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,340
Dredd? No!

242
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,760
Dredd? No!

243
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,311
Stop video.

244
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:24,441
The video is prima facia evidence
that the defendant is guilty as charged.

245
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,820
Mark it peoples' exhibit A.
- Objection, your Honor.

246
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:34,618
This video is inadmissible as evidence.
If I may begin in a moment to explain.

247
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,329
Please do.

248
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:42,125
I have an affidavit from Nathan Olmeyer,
currently a junior at the Academy.

249
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,296
He has been acknowledged by every one
of his instructors to be an expert

250
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:49,257
in digital and video graphics.

251
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:54,388
The surveillance video, as his affidavit
states, is of such low definition.

252
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:58,642
No positive identification can be made
ofthe killer.

253
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,646
The uniform of a Judge can be counterfeit.

254
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:05,273
And the badge can be duplicated.

255
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:10,404
Neither the video nor the audio
in this presentation identify the accused.

256
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:15,742
I repeat my objection to this video
being allowed as evidence in this case.

257
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,829
And I ask for a ruling.

258
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,925
Objection sustained.
The video is inadmissible.

259
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,762
Yes!

260
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:42,561
Admit it, Dredd.
- What? You're impressed.

261
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,398
Very.
- You owe me.

262
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:50,402
I have to move to technical information
of a criminal nature.

263
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:58,368
I will need the court's permission
to access top secret documentation

264
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:02,289
with the help of Central Computer Bank.
- You may proceed.

265
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:06,460
Central, are you on line?
- On line, Judge McGruder.

266
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:10,213
I wish you to access weapons schematic.

267
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:14,760
Please describe the working of
the standard Judge's sidearm, Lawgiver 2.

268
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:19,514
Model 2 is coded to the personal DNA
ofthe Judge using the weapon.

269
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,518
By the skin's contact with the grip.

270
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,688
Did you know it? - No.
- The DNA is

271
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:31,902
from my medical files and upgraded
automatically when the weapon is reloaded.

272
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:37,074
When a round is chambered, the projectile
is tagged with that relevant DNA.

273
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:41,745
The defense was not made aware ofthis.

274
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,707
Judge Hershey! The prosecution
must be given time to finish.

275
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:54,132
Central, were the bullets recovered
from the bodies ofVardis and Lily Hammond

276
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,844
so DNA coded?

277
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,348
Yes, Judge McGruder.
It could not be otherwise.

278
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:07,687
What was the result ofthe computer check
ofthe DNA on those bullets?

279
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:12,484
The DNA's a perfect match for Judge Dredd.

280
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:16,321
A lie! The evidence has been falsified!
It's impossible!

281
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:20,200
I never broke the law! I am the law!

282
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,954
We have no case!
- You've gotta believe me!

283
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:28,041
You have to believe me! Say it!

284
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,294
Your Honor, the prosecution rests.

285
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,929
The tribunal needs to confer.

286
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:50,313
What have I done?
How could I have been so wrong!

287
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:56,820
Dredd! Both ofthem homicidal! This time
it will be impossible to cover up!

288
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:04,411
Chief Justice. We carefully buried
the Janus project. Nine years ago.

289
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:11,960
Along with Rico and all his victims.
No one'll ever learn ofyour involvement.

290
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:15,630
The media knows how close I am to Dredd.

291
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:21,011
They'll find the truth. The best excuse
to ruin what government we have left.

292
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:27,475
Your motives are pure. You thought Dredd
was different, that's why you spared him.

293
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,021
A mistake which may bring down
the Judicial System.

294
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:42,365
There is a way out, Chief Justice.
Lfyou'll forgive me.

295
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,995
The Long Walk.

296
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:52,626
That's a death sentence, Judge Griffin.
Mine.

297
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,547
Your retirement grants you the power
to save Dredd's life!

298
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:03,678
This gesture may also allow Janus
to remain a secret.

299
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:17,150
In the charge of premeditated murder,

300
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:20,904
this tribunal finds Joseph Dredd guilty!
As charged.

301
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:32,874
Joseph Dredd, you're aware ofthe law
allows only one punishment for your crime.

302
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:38,672
Death. However,
it has long been our custom

303
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:44,010
to carry out the last order
of a retiring senior Judge.

304
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,683
And soâ€¦

305
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:58,525
I step down. - No!
- I can't believe it.

306
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:06,032
As I leave to take my long walk
into the Cursed Earth

307
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:10,745
I ask that this court honor my last order.

308
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:18,878
Be lenient with Judge Dredd.
In gratitude for his years ofservice.

309
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,550
We will so honor this one, Judge Fargo.

310
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,391
Dredd! Step forward!

311
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:39,399
The sentence shall be life imprisonment!
At Aspen. To be carried out immediately!

312
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,112
As it is written!
- Justice Griffin!

313
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:47,073
The trial was a farce! I demand an appeal!

314
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,702
You will accept the court's decision,
Judge Hershey!

315
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,635
Dredd, I'm so sorry. I let you down.

316
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,267
You did your best, Hershey. Thank you.

317
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,897
Let the betrayer ofthe law
be taken from our courts!

318
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:24,778
Let his armor be taken from him.
And all his garb ofjustice.

319
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:31,034
Let him be stricken from our hearts
and our memories for ever!

320
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:46,049
Let his name be recorded
in every place of honor.

321
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:54,349
Let him take the law he served so well
to those who have it not.

322
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:02,732
Let him be written. In our hearts.

323
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:07,112
And our memories forever.

324
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:02,167
Judge Hershey.

325
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:20,727
Ah, there's gotta be some.

326
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:31,821
What's this?

327
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:35,867
Baby Dredd?
Ah, I can't believe you were ever a baby.

328
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,665
Who's this?

329
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:03,269
Chief Justice Griffin.

330
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:13,488
It's got a nice ring to it.
- We were supposed to meet a place safe!

331
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:24,958
What's not safe?
Your reporter's dead, right?

332
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:30,380
Fargo's on his walk. Dredd's in Aspen.

333
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:35,885
So what's not safe?
- It's unfortunate

334
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:41,349
Hammond had to be silenced.
He'd find out about Janus.

335
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,521
But I coulda used Dredd.
- Forget Dredd! There is no Dredd!

336
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:54,821
Let me tell you what Dredd worships.
He worships the law! He'da blow you away!

337
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:59,367
The minute he found out
how much you're pissin' on it!

338
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:05,081
Yeah. Let him see what it's like
to freeze his ass off in Aspen!

339
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:09,085
Let him see what it's like to be me!

340
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,338
There's a lot ofwork to be done.

341
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,425
Janus? Well, where is it?

342
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:19,804
You'll see it!
- When? Soon enough!

343
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:31,065
In the meantime, I want chaos, Rico.

344
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,986
That block war was just the beginning!

345
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:38,281
Now I want fear
racing through every street!

346
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:43,369
Then the Counsel will have to turn to me.
And to Janus!

347
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:47,790
You want fear? I'm fear.

348
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:52,587
You want chaos? I'm the chaos!
You want a new beginning?

349
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:56,341
Here! I am the new beginning!

350
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:37,548
Dredd? Don't hit me! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Don't hurt me.

351
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,927
What are you doing here?

352
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:44,222
I was convicted of a crime.
Wrongly convicted.

353
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:51,854
Really? That's kinda weird.
What are the odds?

354
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:56,567
Two wrongly convicted guys?
Sitting right next to each other!

355
00:44:57,611 --> 00:45:00,697
You got the sentence the law required.

356
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:03,950
Five years? Just for saving my own ass?

357
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:09,163
That was a mistake.
- The law doesn't make mistakes.

358
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:14,544
Really? Then how do you explain
what happened to you?

359
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:22,051
You can't, can you?

360
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:26,472
Great! Mister "I-am-the-law" can't!

361
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:30,768
So maybe this is some kinda typo?

362
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:34,397
Maybe it's a glitch?
Or maybe it's poeticjustice!

363
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:48,745
So someone's comin', Pa!

364
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:58,087
Praise the Lord
for bringing us this generous bounty.

365
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,382
My sons.

366
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,552
Gather the harvest.

367
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:10,558
So maybe you're here
as some sorta field trip?

368
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:15,938
Yeah. Maybe this is
as some sorta surprise party?

369
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,527
Gonna catch me some city boy!

370
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:24,363
Knife! Knife!

371
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:29,368
It's payback time, Dredd!

372
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:51,140
Dredd! What's happening?

373
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:58,064
By a blast of God they parish!

374
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:01,984
And by a breath of his nostrils
are they consumed.

375
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,531
Hallelujah!

376
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:19,210
Central, I need you to access database.
I want you to run an ID on this man.

377
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:23,673
Scanning for identity. Unknown male.

378
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:28,511
Approximately 200 centimeters tall.
Skin tone three. Ten, nine, eight.

379
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:34,308
Central. Hello?

380
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:38,354
This terminal has been disconnected
from the main system.

381
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:06,591
This is Capture Team. No sign of Dredd.
He appears to have survived the crash.

382
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:10,761
You are in error, Capture Team.
No one survived the shuttle wreck.

383
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,349
The pilot, sir. He's alive.

384
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:19,979
No one survived the shuttle wreck! Do I make myself clear?
- Yes, sir!

385
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:39,540
Am I dead? Am I dead? I'm dead.

386
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:51,677
Awake? Good! We're running outta sinners!

387
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,934
Oh my God!

388
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,610
Dredd! Do something!
- Dredd?

389
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,988
You talk too much.

390
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,324
Can it be?

391
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:30,424
The great man ofthe law himself.

392
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:39,183
Oh Lord, you have blessed us indeed!
Judge. Rat. Dredd.

393
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:49,485
You creeps are under arrest.
- Is that so? Let me crush him, Pa.

394
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:54,907
Excuse me, we're not together.

395
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:59,996
Allow me to introduce you to my family.
There's Link, my oldest.

396
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:04,041
Bite me.
- Hi!

397
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:07,378
My youngest, Junior. - Howdy.
- Hi!

398
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:14,635
And this here is Mean. We had to make
some alterations when he was a child.

399
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:19,098
Well, the Cursed Earth's a tough place
on young folks.

400
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:22,268
I now have him set on one.

401
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:25,479
I don't suggest you make him angry.

402
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:29,316
The legendary Angel family.

403
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:33,195
Cursed Earth pirates,
murderers, scavengers.

404
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:40,119
And of course, scumbags!
- Oh, how to win 'em over!

405
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:43,039
Did I leave something out, Pa?

406
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:46,709
Let me kill him, Pa. I want his ears.
- I want his teeth!

407
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:56,761
Does that come with a fork handsome?

408
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:08,689
Hallelujah, brother!
- Wait a minute!

409
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:14,612
Can it be? Can it be that from the City
ofthe Fallen we have one ofthe faithful?

410
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:18,365
Amen, brother! Praise the Lord!
I'm a believer!

411
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:24,580
We have a believer in the gallery?
- Yes!

412
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:28,292
Cut him down!
- Go tell it on the mountain! - Fergie!

413
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,007
You're making a big mistake.

414
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:40,137
Well, maybe the law doesn't make mistakes,
but I'm free, and you're toast.

415
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:44,016
Actually, you're toast!

416
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:47,645
I forgot to mention it:
Your new friends they're cannibals.

417
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:56,904
You're cute!
- Fresh meat! Prepare the supplicant for sacrifice!

418
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:02,409
Wait! You can't eat me! I've got eczema!
I've got warts! I've had gonorrhea!

419
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,163
Eat Dredd, he works out!

420
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:11,418
It's been fun. Law man.

421
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:15,381
Mean? Finish Dredd.

422
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:20,594
My pleasure, Pa.
- Come on!

423
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,562
Kill him!
- Come on, Junior!

424
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,192
Guilty!

425
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,914
Dredd! Look out!

426
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,256
Dredd!

427
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:12,104
Get up!

428
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:46,263
Well, we did it. We got 'em all!

429
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:50,100
Pussies! Is that all you got?
They are dead, right?

430
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:56,398
Have you been crying?
- No! I've got something in my eye!

431
00:53:56,942 --> 00:54:00,152
Have you ever had allergies?
Dredd! Look out!

432
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:13,582
Chief Justice?
- Joseph. Together again.

433
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:18,295
Together again, sir.

434
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,801
No!

435
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,601
God! Not again!

436
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,900
You've got three strikes, lawman.
Strike one!

437
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:45,614
Strike two!

438
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:52,079
Strike three!

439
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:55,165
Lawman, you're too late!

440
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:59,378
You killed Junior! You got Link!
He who killed my Pa!

441
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:09,722
Mega City Municipal Code 47-22.
Illegal use of city electricity.

442
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:15,060
How do you plead?

443
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:18,147
I knew you'd say that!

444
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:25,821
Graphics analysis, now.

445
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:28,991
Olmeyer, you stupid futz! I can'tâ€¦

446
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:32,703
You analyzed the wrong viewie. This one!

447
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:36,165
I don't believe it!
You just wasted three hours!

448
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:41,170
Lfthis is the wrong picture,
why is it a fake?

449
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:46,008
What?
- Look!

450
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:49,511
It's full of anomalies,
really clever ones, too!

451
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:53,807
Somebody must have used
a CGI terminal and a scan quad

452
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:57,936
to make this state ofthe art.
20 years ago.

453
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:00,856
Are you saying that this isn't real?

454
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:04,443
Yeah. Look.
I'll drop out all the artificial pixels.

455
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,071
Dad. Mom.

456
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:11,784
Foreground. Background.

457
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:16,038
All fake.
The only thing that's real is the baby.

458
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,347
The blind lady.

459
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:37,393
Who is she?
- Justice before your time.

460
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:43,273
We should have never taken Justice
out oftheir hands.

461
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:48,737
You put order to chaos, sir.
- Yeah. That we did. Solved many problems.

462
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:52,950
And created many more!

463
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:58,288
Being a Judge, Joseph, you unite perhaps
too much power in one person's hands.

464
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:04,044
We once tried to compensate.
Created the perfect Judge.

465
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,841
We called it Janus.

466
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:13,595
Four decades ago, DNA samples
were taken from the original Council.

467
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,308
One was chosen: Mine.

468
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:21,645
We altered it
to enhance the best qualities.

469
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:26,066
And to screen out the worst weaknesses.
Frailties.

470
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:32,656
We created you.

471
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:36,869
You didn't create me, sir.

472
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:39,746
I have a family.
- No.

473
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:44,877
At the Academy you said they were killed when I was very young.
- I lied.

474
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:52,092
I have a picture ofthem.
- They're a fake. We lied to both ofyou.

475
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:55,304
Both?

476
00:57:55,388 --> 00:58:00,434
In that experiment another infant
was created. But something went wrong.

477
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:05,063
Genetically mutated
to the perfect criminal.

478
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:09,735
I have a brother?
- You were best friends at the Academy.

479
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,447
Star pupil, and then he turned.

480
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,867
And for his crimes, you judged him.

481
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:20,037
Rico?

482
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,249
Rico!

483
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:28,879
You let me judge my own brother?

484
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:32,758
You never told me, sir.
- I couldn't!

485
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:38,555
You were like a son to me.

486
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,099
A son?

487
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:45,771
My whole life is a lie.

488
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:50,484
Rico had to be executed.
To protect you. To protect the city.

489
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,779
Rico.

490
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,282
Rico.

491
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:00,577
He's alive!

492
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:04,164
No. I signed the order myself.
I saw the report.

493
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:08,502
I didn't kill Hammond. It was him!

494
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:12,089
It was his DNA that convicted me.

495
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:15,175
Griffin. It was Griffin!

496
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:19,513
Griffin, yes.
- We've both been deceived. I'm so sorry.

497
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:24,101
Rico's killed me and destroyed you.

498
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:27,104
Find them, Joseph!

499
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:30,732
Don't die.

500
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:20,866
What do we do? What do we do?

501
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:25,287
Find Rico.

502
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:34,504
Welcome to Janus.

503
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:39,009
Ah, Rico, I think you know Dr. Hayden.

504
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:41,094
I remember you.

505
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:46,224
Justified in front ofthe Council
that I was insane. And therefore innocent.

506
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:49,144
I tried to save you.
- You insulted me!

507
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:52,814
Because I knew exactly what I was doing!
Then and now.

508
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:10,666
Miss Hayden has been a loyal supporter
ofthis project for a long time.

509
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:15,837
She's kept it alive for me. I'm sure
you'll find her expertise invaluable.

510
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:20,634
Excuse me? That's useless if you can't get
into Central's Janus files

511
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:26,264
because the Counsel has 'em locked!
- Leave it to me! Meanwhile, you've work.

512
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:31,061
On the streets. Ilsa will help you.
- I don't need to help. Thank you.

513
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:37,401
I thought you said he was created here
by the finest scientists of Mega City?

514
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:40,195
A bold experiment.

515
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:44,825
A patchwork child.

516
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:48,412
Let's not bicker!
We're all committed to do the same thing!

517
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:52,332
An ordered society.

518
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:57,796
You'll have your new order.

519
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:02,426
Attention, all Judges! Reporting unrest.
Code D 9-2-4.

520
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:07,389
Downtown sector twelve. Backup requested!

521
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,236
My boy.

522
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:12,579
Dredd, there's no way in!

523
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:15,999
Hello? Have you been listening to me?

524
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:20,962
We can'tjust knock on the wall and say,
"Hello, Cursed Earth pizza."

525
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:25,133
There is a way in. Six years ago,
two refugees figured it out.

526
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:29,888
The vent to the city's incinerator.
There's a burst twice a minute.

527
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:35,477
That means you could run through that tube
and have 30 secs before it flames again.

528
01:03:36,437 --> 01:03:39,606
And these refugees made it through, right?

529
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:43,735
Actually, they were roasted.
But the theory's sound.

530
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:49,658
Maybe we should consider other theories?

531
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:56,414
I'm in green quad 4-11. Need a pick-up!

532
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:59,793
Copy, Hershey. I have Central for you.

533
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:02,879
Patch it to my Lawmaster.

534
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:14,933
Oh my God!

535
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:20,730
The latest report: 96 Judges assassinated!

536
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:26,278
Someone knows our procedures, our security
measures, even our scrambled frequencies!

537
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:29,531
No Judges on the streets riots break out.

538
01:04:29,782 --> 01:04:32,117
We can't replace those Judges!

539
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:35,412
Even ifwe put the cadets on the streets!

540
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:38,331
There is a solution.

541
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:42,961
Project Janus.

542
01:04:43,087 --> 01:04:45,547
The Council tried to play God once before.

543
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:50,677
Lfthis wholesale slaughter of Judges
continues, there won't be a Council!

544
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:53,805
Janus could.
- Janus could what?

545
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:58,226
A new bath oftest tube babies won't solve
this crisis! We don't need reliable Judges

546
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:00,312
20 years from now. We needed them today!

547
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:03,940
Accelerated growth incubators
are more developed now.

548
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:09,696
We could create adult subjects.

549
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:16,953
I'm only asking to unlock the Janus files.
That way we at least have an option!

550
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:21,374
Lfthe Council decides not to go forward,

551
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:25,170
I'll accept that decision. And resign.

552
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:38,099
You ready, kid?
- No! Now what's wrong?

553
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:43,480
What's wrong? Did this helmet compress
your brain? You're going to get me killed!

554
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:48,944
There's a maniac loose in the city!
- What a coincidence! One's out here, too!

555
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:51,363
Oh!
- Great time I'm having!

556
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:56,701
The shuttle crash! The Cursed Earth!
Cannibals! And now a fireball up my ass!

557
01:05:56,994 --> 01:06:00,538
All your fault! - My fault? Yes!
- You care to explain that?

558
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:05,377
Lfyou hadn't arrested me,
I wouldn't be here in the first place!

559
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:08,630
Hey Dredd, why don't you just kill me now?

560
01:06:10,174 --> 01:06:15,220
That's it! I'm through schlepping!
I'm going to stay here until I'm caught.

561
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:18,473
Or until you apologize!
- The law can't!

562
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:23,603
That's just it! You're not the law
anymore! Now apologize! I deserve that!

563
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:28,233
I've never apologized.

564
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:34,990
Now run!

565
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:38,368
30, 29, 28, 27!

566
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:42,038
Run!
- 25, 24, 23,

567
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:45,625
22, 21, 20, 19!

568
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:50,588
Dredd! Dredd!

569
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:54,259
Dredd! No!

570
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:57,971
Run!

571
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:21,953
I'm alive! I'm alive!

572
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:26,041
Oh, so are you.

573
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:33,673
Esposito, Carlos. Council Judge.
Authorize access to file. Code name Janus.

574
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:39,471
Acknowledged.

575
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:43,058
McGruder, Evelyn.
Authorize access to file. Code name Janus.

576
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:47,729
Acknowledged.

577
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:51,316
Silver, Gerald.
Authorized access to file code name Janus.

578
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:58,031
Removing security blocks now. Awaiting
password command from Chief Justice.

579
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:00,784
Password: "origin".

580
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:03,620
Janus file open.

581
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:19,969
I'm lost. Is this the bathroom?
- Hey.

582
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:27,018
Now you have to admit, I helped out
on that one. I mean that was all me, baby.

583
01:08:36,737 --> 01:08:36,820
Central, using current technology,

584
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:39,823
Central, using current technology,

585
01:08:41,408 --> 01:08:45,912
how long would it take for Janus
to produce a fully grown adult subject?

586
01:08:45,996 --> 01:08:50,083
Using genetic engineering,
an adult subject could be incubated

587
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:54,838
in approximately 8 hours.
- We could replace our losses in a day!

588
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:57,006
Madness!

589
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:01,094
Dredd. - Silence!
Dredd.

590
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:05,181
Dredd!
- Silence!

591
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:11,312
It's inhuman.
It's not for this Counsel to play God!

592
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:14,732
No, Griffin, restore the security blocks.

593
01:09:15,025 --> 01:09:19,654
It seems none of you have the force
ofwill that these times require.

594
01:09:20,781 --> 01:09:23,783
Central. Leave Janus unlocked!

595
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:27,620
Griffin, this is treason!
You have just sealed your fate.

596
01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:31,499
No! You have just sealed yours!

597
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,252
Rico!

598
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:49,767
Who says politics is boring?

599
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:52,478
Hey, Dredd. I thought it was you!

600
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:55,523
That's right! Cover your ears!

601
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:03,031
Joseph!

602
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:12,457
Get outta here! Now!

603
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:15,919
Oh, you son of aâ€¦
- No!

604
01:10:18,797 --> 01:10:21,883
You're under arrest, Griffin.
- Really?

605
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:31,226
Stop him! He killed the entire Counsel!

606
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:34,562
Move it out!
- Dredd, tell them I'm innocent!

607
01:10:49,453 --> 01:10:52,455
Come on, Fergie! Come on!

608
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:56,501
You're a lot offun to be with, Dredd,
you know that?

609
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:04,884
What do you do? Now what so we do?

610
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:07,762
Hope it works!

611
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:16,771
Shit!
- Work!

612
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:49,095
Dredd, you may want to wash this seat
after we get offthe bike.

613
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:52,598
Sorry. Dredd!

614
01:12:12,786 --> 01:12:15,621
Cover the rear!
- I never fired a gun!

615
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:19,042
What kinda criminal are you?
- A nice criminal.

616
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:25,590
Nothing's happening!
- You got to cock it first, moron!

617
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:29,010
You didn't say anything about cocking!

618
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:23,040
She'll not get her cleaning deposit back!
I mean that's for sure!

619
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:27,545
It doesn't pay to be one ofyour friends.
Sorry!

620
01:14:40,934 --> 01:14:44,145
Hands against the wall!
You know the drill.

621
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:49,775
Who are you? - Dredd saidâ€¦
- Shut up!

622
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:52,778
What happened?
- Why don't you tell me?

623
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:56,073
We're dying out there!
148 Judges in 48 hours!

624
01:14:57,034 --> 01:14:59,994
What the hell is going on?

625
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:04,415
Do you think I'm part ofthis?
- I don't know who or what you are!

626
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:16,427
I would never do anything to her.
Nothin'.

627
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:26,020
All right.

628
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:29,774
You tell me about him.

629
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:33,402
You make me believe in you
like I did when I defended you!

630
01:15:33,904 --> 01:15:37,031
His name is Rico. And he's my brother.

631
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:43,955
The DNA sample has been taken out of
frozen stasis. Ready for cloning process.

632
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:47,166
We got a slight change of plans here.

633
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:51,587
I want to take the existing DNA sample
right now and trash it.

634
01:15:52,756 --> 01:15:55,883
Activate this DNA sampling counsel.

635
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:59,512
What are you doing?
- Central! Take this DNA sample!

636
01:16:02,015 --> 01:16:05,142
Now!
- This wasn't part of our plan!

637
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:09,188
Griffin would have never authorized this!

638
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:13,442
Griffin got to be my keeper
by putting me behind bars.

639
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:20,157
What's your excuse?

640
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:24,036
He said I had no feelings and no emotions.

641
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:28,833
Now you know why.
- Dredd.

642
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:32,044
Look at me.

643
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:37,091
The Janus Project didn't do that to you.
You did that to yourself.

644
01:16:39,219 --> 01:16:44,473
Sorry, guys, I'm getting nowhere with
your terminal! But I fixed the microwave.

645
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:48,394
Is this a bad time?

646
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:52,565
Hey, look, I tried dialing everything
I could think ofto find this Janus thing.

647
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:55,943
It isn't in the program! Nowhere! Nothing!

648
01:16:56,278 --> 01:17:00,364
They won't put it on the computer network,
but they need power.

649
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:04,619
They've to steal it. So check every sector
for blackouts and sudden power surges.

650
01:17:04,703 --> 01:17:07,872
Let's stay here longer!
- Wait a second!

651
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:12,126
There was a big power surge just before
they blew up my Lawmaster in sector 4!

652
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:15,796
Three blocks wide!
The last time I felt something like that

653
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:20,426
they shut down the whole power grid.
- But they moved the statue of Liberty

654
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:23,638
and put it on top of it.
- Could we go?

655
01:17:24,389 --> 01:17:27,516
Dredd? That's twice you owe me.

656
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:35,816
Rico! Dredd got away from the hunters.

657
01:17:36,693 --> 01:17:40,237
He's about to be seriously outnumbered.
Right, Central?

658
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:44,533
Affirmative.
The new DNA samples have been multiplexed.

659
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:48,245
And the gametes are already diving.
- New sample?

660
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:53,834
You left that DNA there for over 30 years.
Somebody has to clean out the fridge.

661
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:58,547
We made the sample from the best specimens
on the Council of Judges!

662
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:01,676
What did you replace it with?

663
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:04,387
No. My God.

664
01:18:04,471 --> 01:18:08,557
You know you should congratulate me
because I'm about to become a daddy.

665
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:10,893
And you're being very rude!

666
01:18:10,977 --> 01:18:15,064
You don't know what you're doing!
- The next batch of Janus Judges

667
01:18:15,148 --> 01:18:18,234
are going to be my brothers and sisters!

668
01:18:18,318 --> 01:18:21,487
And mine to control!
- Just stop all this!

669
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:33,082
Central! Help me!

670
01:18:33,917 --> 01:18:38,337
I'm sorry, Chief Justice, the ABC robot
is not tied into my main processors.

671
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:42,508
That's right, Griff. You know
you got to get with this high-tech stuff?

672
01:18:42,592 --> 01:18:45,720
- Robot! Rip his arms and legs off.
- No!

673
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:50,141
And you save his head for last!
I don't want him to miss anything!

674
01:18:55,313 --> 01:18:57,982
You stay here.
- I wanta go with you.

675
01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:00,067
You need me to shut down the Janus system.

676
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:03,612
We're a team! We could use some work,
but we're still a team.

677
01:19:04,114 --> 01:19:07,241
I'll handle it.
- I bring you luck!

678
01:19:07,367 --> 01:19:08,617
Luck?

679
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:11,829
You are still alive, Dredd.
- Hm.

680
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:32,600
I'm getting a signal.

681
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:39,064
Jesus Christ!

682
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:41,025
Get back!

683
01:19:48,074 --> 01:19:49,950
Dredd!

684
01:19:58,043 --> 01:20:00,753
Drop the gun.

685
01:20:02,547 --> 01:20:06,091
Robot? On the count ofthree,
break her neck. One, two.

686
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:08,886
No!

687
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:15,351
Hershey.

688
01:20:15,435 --> 01:20:17,603
I'm still here.

689
01:20:17,687 --> 01:20:20,231
How romantic.

690
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:22,983
Step inside.

691
01:20:33,203 --> 01:20:35,246
He looks a lot like you.

692
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:38,499
He is a lot like me.
- I'm nothing like you.

693
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:41,710
The only difference about us is:

694
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:45,047
You destroyed your life
to embrace the law.

695
01:20:46,299 --> 01:20:49,426
And I destroy the law to embrace life.

696
01:20:52,138 --> 01:20:54,431
And speaking of life.

697
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:57,226
Send in the clones.

698
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:03,566
Behold.

699
01:21:19,249 --> 01:21:22,626
This is where you were born.
You feel that magic?

700
01:21:24,671 --> 01:21:27,798
You must have known. All along.

701
01:21:29,175 --> 01:21:31,802
You were different.

702
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:36,223
Fergie?

703
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:40,561
Are you still alive?
- Technically yes.

704
01:21:47,652 --> 01:21:51,280
Your brother and your sister
will be born in two hours.

705
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:54,950
One big, endless supply of perfection!

706
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:00,706
We have a choice. We can stand here

707
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:05,878
and create a whole race of goddamn
brainwashed morons. And call them Judges!

708
01:22:06,296 --> 01:22:09,089
Or create some free-thinking people?

709
01:22:09,174 --> 01:22:12,176
We'll call them human.

710
01:22:13,219 --> 01:22:15,095
Human.

711
01:22:17,390 --> 01:22:20,517
You could never control yourself.

712
01:22:20,852 --> 01:22:24,355
What makes you think
you can control these things?

713
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:27,942
Because you're in control.

714
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:31,403
You'll be head ofthe Counsel. You choose.

715
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:35,115
And you choose quickly, too.

716
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:38,410
I shall put you down myself. Personally.

717
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:44,416
You know, I never understood that!
Why did you judge me?

718
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:47,795
Why?
- You killed innocent people!

719
01:22:47,879 --> 01:22:49,880
The means to an end!
- A massacre!

720
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:52,341
A revolution!
- You betrayed the law!

721
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:55,135
No! I betrayed this!

722
01:22:57,055 --> 01:23:00,516
You are Counsel's experiment which failed!
In you!

723
01:23:02,686 --> 01:23:05,813
I was your brother, blood and friend!

724
01:23:06,356 --> 01:23:11,402
Who betrayed who? When will you stop
being the goddamn slave and grow up!

725
01:23:11,903 --> 01:23:17,241
That's your birth right, your family!
I'm your family! The only family you had!

726
01:23:19,035 --> 01:23:21,787
Now choose!

727
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:28,377
The best thing that you can do: Kill me.

728
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:30,462
Why?

729
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:33,549
Because it's your only chance,

730
01:23:34,634 --> 01:23:36,552
brother!

731
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:39,054
Fido!

732
01:23:41,474 --> 01:23:44,309
Rip this bitche's arms and legs off!

733
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:47,354
Save her head for my brother!
- No!

734
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:49,106
Halt!

735
01:23:50,066 --> 01:23:53,318
Rip his head off instead! Give it to her!

736
01:23:57,699 --> 01:24:00,576
What's a matter with you?

737
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:02,369
Rico!

738
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:08,584
Boy, is he pissed!
- Fergie!

739
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:12,129
Dredd!

740
01:24:21,639 --> 01:24:24,391
Hack you, asshole!

741
01:24:25,643 --> 01:24:27,352
Rico!

742
01:24:28,605 --> 01:24:33,025
Central, hatch the first set of clones!
- The process is not finished.

743
01:24:33,109 --> 01:24:35,569
The clones will be only 60% complete.

744
01:24:35,695 --> 01:24:39,239
I need reinforcements!
Hatch the goddamn clones! Now!

745
01:24:51,795 --> 01:24:54,797
Fight girls much? Do ya?

746
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:34,128
Bitch!

747
01:25:34,879 --> 01:25:37,631
Judge Bitch!

748
01:26:25,555 --> 01:26:28,098
I'm the only one who never lied to you.

749
01:26:28,224 --> 01:26:31,185
I'll be the Judge ofthat!

750
01:26:57,212 --> 01:27:00,380
Now, Joseph Dredd, I herebyjudge you.

751
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:05,677
The charge: Betraying your flesh.

752
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:10,390
Guilty! And the charge of being human!
When we coulda been Gods!

753
01:27:12,268 --> 01:27:14,144
Guilty.

754
01:27:15,313 --> 01:27:18,482
The sentence is death.
- Don't miss.

755
01:27:19,442 --> 01:27:22,402
Lethal rounds exhausted.

756
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:27,866
Phaser flare!

757
01:27:30,119 --> 01:27:32,829
Court's adjourned.

758
01:27:46,177 --> 01:27:48,053
Dredd!

759
01:28:03,194 --> 01:28:05,904
Give me your hand.

760
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:23,839
Stand back, Hershey.

761
01:28:26,884 --> 01:28:28,885
Am I under arrest?

762
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:30,971
That won't be necessary.

763
01:28:31,055 --> 01:28:35,892
Central broadcasted Janus plan after
Griffin's death. They all know the truth.

764
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:39,396
Judge Dredd.
We have to reconstitute the Counsel.

765
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:44,234
We would like you to consider
the first position of Chief Justice.

766
01:28:45,903 --> 01:28:48,572
I'm a Street Judge.

767
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:50,615
Mr. Olmeyer.

768
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:53,910
I'm dying. I'm too young toâ€¦ Excuse me!

769
01:28:55,788 --> 01:28:58,415
Oh, that's great, he's the number one!

770
01:28:58,541 --> 01:29:00,334
Dredd?

771
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:02,669
I told him everything he knows.

772
01:29:02,754 --> 01:29:05,380
Dredd? That's it?

773
01:29:07,383 --> 01:29:11,011
A mere death experience and no goodbye?
- Goodbye, Hershey.

774
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:22,064
It goes without saying that I kiss better.

775
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:25,317
Ow! Come on, guys, let's get going!

776
01:29:36,329 --> 01:29:38,538
Feels good to be human, don't you
think?

777
01:29:38,623 --> 01:29:41,625
I knew you'd say that.
