1
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,745
After nearly five years
of appeals...

2
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:45,040
Dino Moretti, reputed lieutenant
of the Franco crime family...

3
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:48,627
was released from prison today,
and acquitted of all charges...

4
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:51,547
in connection with the murders
of police officer Frank Castle...

5
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,882
and his family.

6
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:55,426
Moretti has long maintained
his innocence...

7
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,928
claims he has no idea
who is responsible...

8
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:01,724
for the 125 mysterious
gangland murders...

9
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:05,186
often attributed to a shadowy figure
known as the "Punisher"...

10
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:08,147
which have occurred in this city
over the last half decade.

11
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:13,027
- Laurie Silvers has this on the scene report.
- Mr. Moretti?

12
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,113
- How does it feel to be finally acquitted?
- It feels great.

13
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:17,364
Just great.

14
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:20,075
The government says
it's going to appeal.

15
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,870
Let them appeal a hundred times.
I'll still win.

16
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,121
This is America.

17
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:26,707
If a man is innocent,
justice prevails.

18
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,294
Are you worried about
the Punisher?

19
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:34,006
Let me tell you something about
this "Punisher", whoever he is.

20
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:38,177
If he ever shows up
within 1,000 yards of me...

21
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,722
he'll find out what the word "punished"
really means.

22
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,600
Now, if you'll excuse me.

23
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,311
And there you have it.

24
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,981
The clapper Don, Allegedly head
of the powerful Franco crime family...

25
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:53,984
once again shrugging off
any fear of the Punisher...

26
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:57,947
despite the fact that
over 125 organized crime figures...

27
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,076
have been murdered by the self-styled
vigilante in the last five years.

28
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,704
This is Laurie Silvers
for Channel 8 News.

29
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:13,837
Hey, what do you think?
Maybe I got a future in politics.

30
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,965
Okay. Enough of the jokes.
Let's break out the champagne.

31
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:18,175
- I'll get it, boss.
- No. First things first.

32
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,302
- You check the house. I'll get the champagne.
- Sure.

33
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:23,222
Hey Mikey!
Start the music around here.

34
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,654
What the fuck?

35
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,736
Jesus!
Joey!

36
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,373
Come on, you guys,
party time.

37
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,544
Joey...

38
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:37,838
<i>YUM!</i>

39
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,133
- Switch on those cameras!
- Keep them rolling!

40
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,676
- Come on, GUYS!
- Okay.

41
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,094
- Move it!
- Okay.

42
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:50,100
Keep it rolling!
Keep it rolling!

43
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,400
Look, there's somebody there.

44
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:00,694
I got the tight shot.

45
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:04,365
- I got it covered. I covered this!
- Who is that?

46
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,159
- Holy shit! The Punisher!
- It's him!

47
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:10,662
- Move in for a close-up! Get a close-up!
- I got it!

48
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,623
Are you getting it?

49
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,461
Out of the way!

50
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,885
Are you getting it?

51
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:28,847
- I got shit all over the place!
- Keep them going!

52
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,563
Come on, God.

53
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:38,565
Answer me.

54
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:42,611
It's years I'm asking you why.
Why are the innocent dead...

55
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:46,156
and the guilty alive?
Where is justice?

56
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,659
Where is punishment?

57
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:52,913
Or have you already answered?
Have you already said to the world:

58
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:57,167
"Here is justice,
here is punishment."

59
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,086
Here...

60
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,130
in me?

61
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,509
Mommy, aren't we going
to wait for daddy?

62
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:10,347
Daddy's working.
We'll meet him at grandma's. Okay?

63
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:17,813
Julie!

64
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,232
Julie!

65
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,289
Lieutenant,
are you being pressured...

66
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,124
to resign as the head
of the "Punisher task force"?

67
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,585
- No comment.
- Lieutenant, do you have leads?

68
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,254
- No comment.
- Lieutenant, do you still think...

69
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,882
that Frank Castle and the Punisher
are the same person?

70
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,342
- Absolutely.
- Despite the fact that the official police...

71
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,970
Don't you people have anything
better to do with your time?

72
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:54,475
It's 2:00 in the Goddamn morning,
for Christ's sake.

73
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:58,187
Hey, give me a break.

74
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:04,026
- Now, that was smart. Very smart.
- The chief of detectives.

75
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,820
It must be something very important
to bring you out at 2 a.m.

76
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:07,738
- It is.
- Yeah?

77
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,740
I have a message
from the mayor.

78
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,826
I quote: "Frank Castle is dead."

79
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,871
No more talk about him
being otherwise.

80
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,790
You tow the line
or you get the boot.

81
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:20,792
You'd go along with that, too.

82
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,879
Jake, we cannot let the public think
there's some psychotic ex-cop...

83
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,965
whacking off wise guys
like he's got a hunting license.

84
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,760
Why not?
Why not?

85
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:33,680
Berkowitz, it's late.
I'm tired.

86
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:36,058
You're warned.

87
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:41,188
What the hell
ever happened to you?

88
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,366
Okay, Graham,
I'm gonna shoot an update.

89
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,368
- Excuse me, Lieutenant Berkowitz?
- Yeah.

90
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,162
- I'm detective Sam Leary.
- Sam?

91
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,580
Samantha.

92
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:00,707
I worked with you once
five years ago.

93
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:05,671
Did the Moretti heroin bust.
It was my first assignment plain-clothes.

94
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,215
- I was the hooker!
- Oh, right.

95
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,842
What can I do for you,
detective?

96
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:13,470
I'd like at shot
at being your partner.

97
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,014
- I don't work with a partner.
- But you used to.

98
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:18,684
Right, used to.
Past tense.

99
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:24,314
I'm not after a free ride.
I can carry my share of the load.

100
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:25,691
I'm sure you can.

101
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,986
No, you're not.
You're not even listening.

102
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,863
That's right.
I'm not even listening.

103
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,824
- Why?
- 'Cause I work with the best.

104
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,702
Anything else
is a waste of my time.

105
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,246
Besides, so you think
you're the first to apply?

106
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:42,624
- No, but I'm the most qualified.
- What makes you think that?

107
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,377
I graduated first in
my class at the academy.

108
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,589
I scored in the top 1%
in the target range.

109
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:53,010
I made detective first time up, the second
youngest on the force to do that.

110
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,429
It must make
your parents proud.

111
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:58,599
But why should it make you
my partner?

112
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:04,187
I believe that
Frank Castle's the Punisher.

113
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:09,151
Know where my office is?

114
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,861
Yeah.

115
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:14,948
You be there at 9:00 sharp.

116
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,834
Mr. Franco, how does it feel
to be back home?

117
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,712
In the 30 minutes since I've landed:
So far, so good.

118
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,632
- Have you come to take over, sir?
- Come on, fellas, it was a long flight.

119
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,926
- The man's tired. Give him a break.
- Aren't you afraid of the Punisher?

120
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,345
- The Punisher?
- Yeah.

121
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:39,014
In Europe, they think you made it up
to sell newspapers.

122
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,474
There is no Punisher.

123
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:43,143
What's been killing your
associates for five years?

124
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,729
Too much stress, I guess.
Thanks for coming.

125
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,273
Come on. Vanish!

126
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:50,150
Just a second.

127
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,613
Can I help you, detective?

128
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:59,493
- Oh, you already have, Franco.
- Really? How?

129
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:03,246
Kind of like a worm
helps a fisherman.

130
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,667
I'm glad you finally
came home, Gianni.

131
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,671
I was running out of bait.
I'll see you around.

132
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:14,591
Too much stress, huh?

133
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:17,094
That's funny.

134
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:21,890
- How'd you like it there, Tommy?
- It was okay.

135
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,059
Learn good stuff
in those fancy schools?

136
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:27,104
- Come on, show him something you learned, son.
- You got a quarter?

137
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,314
Sure.

138
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:32,192
- Here you go.
- Watch him.

139
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,738
Hey, that's great!

140
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:42,160
- I can do it with $10.
- That's expensive for me.

141
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:45,622
Give this to Louie in the kitchen
with my compliments.

142
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:48,875
Ask him to give you
more cheesecake.

143
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,544
Lose something?

144
00:11:56,967 --> 00:12:00,262
Okay, so tell me.
How bad is it?

145
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,972
How bad?

146
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,935
If you didn't come home,
I would be head of the family.

147
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:11,106
It's not going to be
families anymore.

148
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:14,151
That's old thinking.
It's clad thinking.

149
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,779
There'll be no more wars,
no more territories.

150
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,949
How are you going to
convince anyone?

151
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:24,077
With an act of good faith
so generous...

152
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:27,247
that even Freddy Deleo
will see the light.

153
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,790
A week from now,
I've arranged...

154
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:33,587
- for 600 kilos of pure junk to come in.
- 600 Ks?

155
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,424
$500 million worth.
Everyone gets their share.

156
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:40,802
Provided they work together
to make it happen.

157
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,388
One group on security,
one at receiving...

158
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:46,641
one in collecting,
one in distribution..

159
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,852
That wouldn't be too hard,
would it?

160
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,856
And what do we do
about the Punisher?

161
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,567
One thing at a time, Jim.

162
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,445
First we consolidate.

163
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,615
And then we obliterate.

164
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,175
Excuse me, kind sir...

165
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:24,679
but I can't help but see in you
a man far luckier than me.

166
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:25,764
What?

167
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,642
Whatever you can spare
will be sufficient.

168
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,561
And this old thespian...

169
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:37,359
- What the hell's a thespian?
- An actor, sir.

170
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,069
Oh, sure.

171
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,490
- Thank you.
- Hey!

172
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:46,368
What'd I tell you about
bugging the customers?

173
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:49,579
Richie.
Throw this trash out of here.

174
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,960
- Alright, let's go.
- You can't treat me like this.

175
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,003
- Come on!
- I demand some respect!

176
00:13:57,087 --> 00:14:00,340
I'm not trash!
I'm a man!

177
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:07,264
Maybe I should have tried
some Eugene O'Neill.

178
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,851
Hi there.

179
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:56,354
Nice weather we are having
for this time of year.

180
00:14:56,438 --> 00:15:01,818
You were supposed
to meet me here four hours ago.

181
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,779
I know. I know all about it.
I've been hearing it all my life.

182
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:07,282
Checks, responsibility...

183
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:12,412
- Can't keep an appointment.
- Where is the dope coming into?

184
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,456
The dope?

185
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:20,170
The dope...
Oh, that. Pier 30.

186
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,303
But the location's
not the big story.

187
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,347
But who'll be there is.

188
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,767
- Who'll be there?
- Everyone.

189
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,852
They're all working together now.

190
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,687
One big, happy family...

191
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:42,442
under the fatherly wing
of your old friend Gianni Franco.

192
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:47,822
Mr. P!

193
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:49,824
Happy hunting!

194
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,673
Allez, vite. lls rapprochent.

195
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:13,056
I can't get
this frigging thing to work.

196
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:21,106
- Very difficult...
- Well, fuck you.

197
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:23,274
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

198
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:26,611
Hey, there's $500 million
out there, assholes.

199
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:29,531
Cool out!
Here, check the perimeter.

200
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,366
Get With it!

201
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,496
Hello, Red 1?
Come in.

202
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,874
Red 1,
will you get off your ass?

203
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,711
- What?
- Everything's Okay?

204
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,212
Yeah!

205
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,806
- Red 2, what have you got?
- Bad kidneys. I got to pee.

206
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,267
So pee.
Everything's okay?

207
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,394
Yeah. It's dead here.

208
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,779
The U.S. Coast guard!
Cut your engines.

209
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:15,577
- What are you doing here?
- We had to pull into clock.

210
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,705
Our hull is leaking.
Down there. Have a look.

211
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:50,612
- 15 minutes late.
- Jesus Christ...

212
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:55,450
- Fucking faggot frenchmen.
- Here they come. Here they come!

213
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:36,741
You're 15 minutes late,
you stupid dickhead.

214
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:38,701
What's the big idea?

215
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,647
He)', guys, get back there!

216
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:34,651
600 kilos of dope.
Seven dead wise guys.

217
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,778
All from different families.

218
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,823
Guess it's a drug deal gone bad.

219
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,332
Guess again.

220
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:48,433
Idiko Tanaka.
She's single, in her early 40s.

221
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:49,976
She has one daughter.

222
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,271
A mute american girl
she adopted at birth..

223
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,523
Who never leaves her sight.

224
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,900
She's a graduate from
Harvard business school...

225
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:01,487
and the first female
ever to head the Yakuza.

226
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,531
Yaku... what?

227
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,783
Yakuza.
Japanese mafia.

228
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:08,995
- This is a long fucking way from Japan.
- It is.

229
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:11,539
- What are they doing here?
- I don't know.

230
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:13,624
We are about to find out.

231
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,168
Okay.

232
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:28,056
- Lady Tanaka.
- Mr. Franco.

233
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:31,893
It is an honor.
Your reputation precedes you.

234
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,062
As does yours.

235
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:36,397
- Please sit down.
- No, thank you.

236
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:39,650
What I have to say will be brief.

237
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:44,530
We have been tracking your organization
for quite some time.

238
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:50,328
Your leadership is decimated.
Your soldiers are inexperienced.

239
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:55,333
Our little demonstration on Pier 30
was ample proof of that.

240
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:59,545
You're weak, Mr. Franco.

241
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:01,381
Vulnerable.

242
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,841
And we are not.

243
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:12,392
We could cripple all your operations -
legal, as well as illegal - very easily.

244
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:19,399
- But we don't want that.
- With all clue respect, Miss Tanaka...

245
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:22,485
let's cut through
the bullshit.

246
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,946
What do you want?

247
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:27,698
- A partnership.
- Define the term.

248
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:32,870
You will manage and oversee
all your business on a day-to-day basis.

249
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:40,795
We will assume the duties of executive
administration, investments, financial services.

250
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:43,840
- Come on!
- I'm not through.

251
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:55,017
- What do you propose as a split?
- 75% for us.

252
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,727
25% for you.

253
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:01,899
No fucking way am I going to be
a salary boy to some bunch of nips.

254
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:03,943
I don't know about
the rest of you guys...

255
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:07,572
but the Deleo family gives up shit.
We don't work for nobody.

256
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:09,991
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

257
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:12,577
We are Yakuza.

258
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:18,040
When your ancestors were still shepherds
screwing sheep on the mediterranean coast...

259
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:21,377
ours were
the crime lords of Asia.

260
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:26,215
I'm not offering terms, Mr. Franco,
I'm making demands.

261
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:29,177
And what if we choose
not to comply?

262
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,681
Steps are now being taken
to ensure that you will.

263
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:37,643
You Americans
have a great capacity for violence.

264
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:41,564
But it's wild, unfocused.

265
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,608
You will learn.

266
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:51,115
Good clay, gentlemen.

267
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:55,786
What do we do?

268
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:59,207
Only one thing we can.

269
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,627
We go to war.

270
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:18,476
What do you think you're going to do with that?
Play Ms. Pac-Man or something?

271
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,895
- Hopefully find Castle.
- No shit.

272
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,730
No shit.

273
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:25,858
How are we going to accomplish
this little miracle?

274
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:28,819
I've accessed
into all available data banks...

275
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:30,780
with information on him...

276
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,241
and programmed the computer
to form an analysis...

277
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:36,619
- Of probable locations.
- Oh, wow.

278
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,205
Even the Punisher
has to live somewhere.

279
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:50,758
Hey.

280
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:54,095
- You see this board here?
- Yeah.

281
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:58,057
I've been living with it for five years.
Every time he kills somebody...

282
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,559
I put a pin in it.

283
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:04,188
I fine-tooth every building,
every alley, in this city.

284
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:07,316
The only thing
that I've got to show for it...

285
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,236
is these
little calling cards here...

286
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:12,989
and a whole bunch of these.

287
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:18,286
I've already been
through this city.

288
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:22,039
I've been in it, around it,
on top of it.

289
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:24,458
You name it.

290
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:28,170
How about under it?

291
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:41,017
- I get the red. I hate yellow.
- The red's gross, Jenny.

292
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,686
I think it's totally hot.

293
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:49,233
Hi. I'm Peter bear.
I really care.

294
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:53,529
And to show you it's true,
I have some things to teach you.

295
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:55,114
Like what, Peter?

296
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:08,002
- Come on!
- Wait up!

297
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,381
Hey, hold it!

298
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:16,093
Roger?

299
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:17,803
Roger?

300
00:27:26,354 --> 00:27:27,855
Hello?

301
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:29,857
Hello?

302
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:32,151
Come out.

303
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,904
Come out, wherever you are.

304
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:41,494
Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble,
I better get out of here on the double.

305
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:50,252
With your flair for entrances...

306
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:54,215
you should consider
a career in the theater.

307
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:56,592
I'll think about it.

308
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:58,803
What are you doing here?

309
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:04,266
What would I be doing, tramping around
the sewers of this great metropolis?

310
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,687
- Sightseeing.
- Very funny.

311
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:12,066
I bring you news,
you give me grief.

312
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:15,653
You know,
they all think you're dead.

313
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:18,864
They'll kill each other now.

314
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:21,659
Turn the lights off
when you leave.

315
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,370
Very clever.

316
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:27,248
And what will you do
While the carnage ensues?

317
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:28,749
Take a vacation.

318
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:33,379
Yes, I hear the sewers of Paris
are lovely this time of year.

319
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:36,048
And what about the children?

320
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:39,051
- What children?
- The children of the new bosses...

321
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:41,470
are now counted
among their losses.

322
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:45,141
They're being held for ransom
by the japanese.

323
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,686
So the bosses
will have to pay up.

324
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:50,521
Pay they will
and all for naught.

325
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:54,358
The children will be sold by the slave trade.
They've been bought.

326
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:56,152
My God, man, don't you see?

327
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:59,405
This is the result
of your five-year killing spree.

328
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,657
You weakened the fathers
to such degrees...

329
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:04,660
they couldn't protect
their own families.

330
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:08,247
I punish the guilty.

331
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:11,917
And as a result,
the innocent now suffer.

332
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:19,008
You must do something!

333
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:22,344
You must do something.

334
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:28,768
Enough of this
fucking brainstorming.

335
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:30,936
Let's snatch her daughter,
take her to the meeting...

336
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,313
with this in her mouth,
then we talk.

337
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:35,483
Freddy, before you go snatching anybody,
let me tell you a story...

338
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:37,902
about our Miss Tanaka.

339
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:44,408
The only person she was ever close to
was her twin brother.

340
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:47,411
They grew up in a Tokyo orphanage
after the second world war.

341
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:51,582
They were inseparable.
They lived together their whole lives.

342
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,084
One clay he stuck the Yakuza
for a lot of money...

343
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:57,546
which he had no intention
of paying back.

344
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,800
Nothing happened to him
because of her.

345
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:04,720
Then other people started
getting the same idea.

346
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:08,224
Before she could become
head of the organization...

347
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:12,436
the other leaders demanded
an act of absolute loyalty.

348
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:15,648
You know what she did?

349
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:19,109
She went home...

350
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:23,072
cooked her brother
a beautiful meal...

351
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:26,033
waited until he had finished...

352
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:29,078
and then slit his throat.

353
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,163
- Jesus.
- What are you saying?

354
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:34,875
- We don't deal with her?
- We can't deal with her.

355
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:37,962
You're saying there's nothing
that can save our kids.

356
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:41,674
There is, but it's lying
at the bottom of the harbor.

357
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:49,682
- Well, I'm going to the meeting.
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm going, too.

358
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,394
I'm not.

359
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:18,312
Good.
The money for the children.

360
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:21,815
The slave business
is very profitable.

361
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:26,320
Come on. Don't cry.
We're going to be okay.

362
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:29,573
We're not going to be okay.
It's because of my father I'm here.

363
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:30,866
That's not true.

364
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,202
Then why are we here,
Mr. Know-It-All?

365
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:36,455
- I don't know.
- We're being held for ransom...

366
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,457
because our fathers
are rich gangsters.

367
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,335
So why am I here?
My father's not a gangster.

368
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:43,170
Are you kidding?

369
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,673
Your father's the biggest gangster
and a coward.

370
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:49,301
My dad said if he didn't run from
his responsibilities, there wouldn't be this mess.

371
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:51,428
- Bullshit!
- You're bullshit!

372
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:55,349
Hey, stop!

373
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,985
Why are you fighting?

374
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:09,655
Everything is going to be
all right.

375
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:12,032
I want to go home.

376
00:33:12,116 --> 00:33:14,410
- And you will.
- When?

377
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,120
Soon.

378
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:25,087
Here, here...
No more tears.

379
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,174
Here.

380
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:34,805
- Come with me.
- Leave her alone!

381
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:24,772
- Come in.
- Thank you.

382
00:35:01,183 --> 00:35:03,018
Here's your usual.

383
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:12,129
Every clay the children are gone,
it's going to cost you money.

384
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:19,970
Take that message
to your people.

385
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:13,899
Take the money. Run.
Go! Go!

386
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:43,679
Hold it. Hold it.
Who are these two happy campers?

387
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:46,139
Don't ask me.
I can't get a word out of them.

388
00:37:46,223 --> 00:37:49,851
Be still.
I said, be still.

389
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:53,605
You'd think he was hiding
something under there.

390
00:37:53,689 --> 00:37:56,191
- May I?
- Be my guest.

391
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:03,615
What the hell is this?

392
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:05,701
Trouble.

393
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,537
Get him out of here.

394
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,165
- I'll get it.
- Okay.

395
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:13,917
Lieutenant?

396
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:30,559
- You're not gonna believe this.
- Try me.

397
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,645
The kids of all the new family heads
have been snatched.

398
00:38:33,729 --> 00:38:36,857
They've named the Punisher
as the prime suspect.

399
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:41,194
They're wrong.

400
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:44,823
- It makes sense.
- I know it does. But they're wrong.

401
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:49,911
- Do you have a reason for saying that?
- I've got two reasons for saying that.

402
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:21,026
My contacts tell me
the kids are here.

403
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:25,113
- You sure this is it?
- I'd stake my reputation on it.

404
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:27,532
If I had one.

405
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:29,910
Do You got a spare?

406
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,412
- What?
- One of those.

407
00:39:33,372 --> 00:39:36,666
If they're holding the kids here,
it's with a fucking arsenal.

408
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:40,045
You move left instead of right,
you're dead.

409
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:43,840
The critics said the same
thing about my Hamlet.

410
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:46,134
Stay here.

411
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:48,136
Watch your back.

412
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:40,577
That was
a very expensive question...

413
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:43,913
you asked at our place
the other night.

414
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:52,213
It cost us nearly
2 million dollars in cash.

415
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:01,598
How much pain
do you think that buys?

416
00:44:03,183 --> 00:44:07,187
Is the question true/false
or multiple choice?

417
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,273
Neither.

418
00:44:26,373 --> 00:44:28,333
Who sent you?

419
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:31,211
Batman.

420
00:44:43,765 --> 00:44:47,394
Do you get the impression
I don't believe you?

421
00:44:47,477 --> 00:44:50,063
Do you think I give a shit?

422
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:09,624
You handle your pain very well.

423
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:19,217
Let's see how well
you handle the pain of others.

424
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:46,911
Now will you tell me?

425
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:52,041
You're a very stubborn man.

426
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:54,794
I have an appointment.

427
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:58,339
I will leave you in the hands
of Mr. Ito.

428
00:46:02,886 --> 00:46:08,224
He will keep you alive
much longer than you care to be.

429
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:10,143
Goodbye.

430
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:15,023
Hey.

431
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:19,360
Have a nice clay.

432
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:45,720
Wait.

433
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:49,140
Come here.

434
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:52,018
I've got something to say.

435
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:58,149
Sayonara.

436
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,746
I don't want to stretch this out,
so why don't you tell me where the kids are.

437
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:13,748
Deserted warehouse.
Avenue "A".

438
00:47:13,832 --> 00:47:16,626
Take care of the little ones.

439
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:20,880
Thank you for your cooperation.

440
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:29,055
You could spend your whole life
down here...

441
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:31,224
and not find one damn clue.

442
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:34,519
- Yeah, we could get lucky.
- The eternal optimist, huh?

443
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:37,397
Look who's talking.
Five years with no leads.

444
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,359
Now you're tramping around the sewers
on a computer's hunch.

445
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:43,736
- How come?
- How come what?

446
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:46,406
How come you never gave up?

447
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:49,951
I know what it's like
to be given up on.

448
00:47:50,827 --> 00:47:54,163
- Who gave up on you?
- Everybody.

449
00:47:54,831 --> 00:47:58,042
- Except him, right?
- That's right.

450
00:47:58,668 --> 00:48:00,712
So, what happened?

451
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:05,091
You know how you go out
for a drink after work?

452
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:07,594
In my case
it was the drink before work...

453
00:48:07,677 --> 00:48:13,141
the drink during work,
and finally the drink instead of work.

454
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:16,436
Then it became a problem.
Nobody wanted to deal with it.

455
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:18,479
Especially me.

456
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:22,400
Before I knew it, I was busted down
to collecting empty shell casings...

457
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:25,236
on the firing range.

458
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,363
Out of sight, out of mind.

459
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:31,743
Then along comes Frank Castle
with a shiny new detective badge...

460
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:35,830
and he says he wants to learn
from the guy who wrote the book...

461
00:48:35,914 --> 00:48:38,750
on busting bad guys.
Me.

462
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:43,046
He took me into his life,
Helped me get my act together...

463
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:45,298
and showed me
how to be a cop again.

464
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:48,718
So I'm thinking: "What's a little
sewer shit for a friend?"

465
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:55,642
You know, when we get our kids back, I'll rip
her fucking heart out with my bare hands.

466
00:48:55,725 --> 00:48:57,518
I swear.

467
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:01,773
None for me.
I'm on medication.

468
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:03,483
Hey, salud.

469
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:05,443
Here's to the safe return
of our children.

470
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:06,945
- Salud.
- Salud.

471
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:13,117
Here we go.

472
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:21,125
So, Mr. Franco
decided not to attend.

473
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,505
- A wise decision.
- What are you talking about?

474
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:41,521
You fucking bitch!

475
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:53,700
Come on! What are you waiting for?
You're going to kill us, do it!

476
00:49:53,783 --> 00:49:56,119
I already have.

477
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,999
Champagner.

478
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:05,670
The glasses.

479
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:36,075
Thirsty, Mr. Deleo?

480
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:51,549
Since you have refused
the drink...

481
00:50:52,884 --> 00:50:57,305
please, accept the chaser.

482
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:02,810
Black coffee, Ed.

483
00:51:02,894 --> 00:51:04,145
Thanks.

484
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:09,901
Hey, that's my bus!
Hey!

485
00:51:11,444 --> 00:51:13,738
Hey, that's my stop!

486
00:51:18,034 --> 00:51:19,327
Hey!

487
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:22,789
Hey!
You missed my stop.

488
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:24,540
Sorry.

489
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:29,337
Thank you.

490
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:33,549
Don't mention it.

491
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:15,299
The kid's ready.
The boat sails in an hour.

492
00:52:15,383 --> 00:52:18,010
Hey, I want you to meet Jimmy.

493
00:52:28,855 --> 00:52:30,690
Wake UP!

494
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:51,335
It's all right.
Don't be afraid.

495
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:58,426
I'm here to take you home.

496
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,399
Come on. Let's go.

497
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,570
Let's go.

498
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:21,407
Come on. Run. Run.
Into the bus.

499
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:23,242
Move it. Move it.

500
00:53:23,326 --> 00:53:25,119
- They took Tommy away.
- What?

501
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:27,997
- Down the corridor.
- Cathy! Where's Cathy?

502
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:31,292
Get in the bus.
Come on.

503
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:35,213
Stay in the bus, okay?
Stay here.

504
00:54:03,783 --> 00:54:05,576
Tommy.

505
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:08,788
- Where's Cathy?
I don't know.

506
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:10,706
Come on.

507
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:23,427
I came down for my dolly.

508
00:54:25,638 --> 00:54:27,598
Run to the bus, Cathy.

509
00:54:32,687 --> 00:54:34,063
Let him go!

510
00:54:37,984 --> 00:54:39,068
Shoot him!

511
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:55,084
- Get down!
- Where's Tommy?

512
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:57,461
They've got him.
I'll get him back.

513
00:55:08,514 --> 00:55:10,975
- All right. Let's go.
- Go! Go!

514
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:34,623
Hold on!

515
00:55:46,302 --> 00:55:48,721
- Stay down!
- I'm scared!

516
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,572
Shit! Cops!

517
00:57:35,703 --> 00:57:36,787
Hold on!

518
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:00,394
Hold your fire!

519
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:03,689
- Come on, kids. Come on. Over here.
- Hurry. Hurry.

520
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:05,691
Is my mommy here?

521
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:07,276
Hurry!

522
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:08,277
It's okay!

523
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,991
Hello, Frank.

524
00:58:57,409 --> 00:58:59,495
How you been?

525
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:06,001
- Busy.
- Oh, I know.

526
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:12,883
I know you have been.

527
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:17,513
I'm in charge
of the body count.

528
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:25,604
- What the hell happened, Frank?
- Frank is dead.

529
00:59:25,688 --> 00:59:27,690
All right?

530
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:29,567
Oh, I see.

531
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:34,822
So you decided everybody else
had to be dead, too.

532
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:36,699
- Is that it?
- Nah.

533
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:40,578
If you're guilty, you're dead.

534
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:48,252
Courts decide who's guilty,
not cops.

535
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:51,088
"They hereby swear
to uphold the law."

536
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:53,048
Remember?

537
00:59:58,387 --> 01:00:01,515
I've been looking for you
for five years, man.

538
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:07,771
Why the hell
didn't you come to me for help?

539
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:12,818
- I didn't need your help.
- You're sick. You know that, don't you?

540
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:22,036
- No, I'm not.
- What do you call 125 murders in 5 years?

541
01:00:23,746 --> 01:00:27,041
- Work in progress.
- God damn you! Look!

542
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:29,585
It's no fucking joke here.

543
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:32,004
They are going to
electrocute you...

544
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:34,131
and there's nothing
I can do anything about.

545
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:38,010
Talk to me, man.
Let me in! Let me in!

546
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:41,221
They were my fuckin' family, too, Frank.
They were my family, too.

547
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:44,808
Let me in, God damn it!
Let me in!

548
01:00:47,436 --> 01:00:50,731
I see.
You want to die. Is that it?

549
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:52,858
Well, fuck you.
Go ahead and die.

550
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:56,445
The Frank I knew
died five years ago.

551
01:00:56,528 --> 01:00:58,530
Fuck you!

552
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:05,454
Open this door!

553
01:01:23,806 --> 01:01:25,849
No! Please don't!

554
01:01:32,231 --> 01:01:35,025
<i>In a few moments,
Frank Castle, the ex-police officer...</i>

555
01:01:35,109 --> 01:01:39,363
<i>who's waged a one-Man war against
organized crime for the past five years...</i>

556
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:45,494
<i>will be escorted to court to face an
unprecedented 125 first-degree murder charges.</i>

557
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:48,831
<i>There's still no news
as to the whereabouts of Tommy Franco...</i>

558
01:01:48,914 --> 01:01:52,376
<i>the son of crime boss
Gianni Franco.</i>

559
01:02:03,137 --> 01:02:05,347
Where's Berkowitz?

560
01:02:05,431 --> 01:02:07,057
Hurting.

561
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,436
- What happened between you two?
- What the fuck do you care?

562
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:14,398
Hey, I care.
I'm his partner.

563
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:18,026
He carried the burden
for a long time by himself.

564
01:02:18,861 --> 01:02:22,281
He needed help,
and you weren't there.

565
01:02:22,364 --> 01:02:24,908
I was the next best thing.

566
01:02:24,992 --> 01:02:27,536
He resigned from the force
after seeing you.

567
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:29,997
He lived for the clay
he found you.

568
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:34,126
That's all he had,
and now you've taken that away.

569
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:36,295
He's your best friend.

570
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:39,548
Why do you want
to take him down with you?

571
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:43,051
You were his life
before this ever happened...

572
01:02:43,135 --> 01:02:47,848
and you've been his life ever since,
and you fucking well know that!

573
01:02:49,391 --> 01:02:53,729
How long do you think someone can live
after you've cut out their heart?

574
01:02:54,688 --> 01:02:57,149
A long time.

575
01:02:57,232 --> 01:03:00,611
Like you?
Is that what you want for Jake?

576
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:03,155
To live like you?

577
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:08,118
- Call him.
- What?

578
01:03:08,202 --> 01:03:10,537
I said, call him.

579
01:03:40,192 --> 01:03:42,903
Nighty-Night, asshole.

580
01:03:57,835 --> 01:03:59,795
Let him be.

581
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:06,677
What happened to your family
wasn't supposed to.

582
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:10,013
If I could undo it, I would,
but I can't.

583
01:04:10,097 --> 01:04:14,810
I swear this on the life
of my son Thomas Anthony.

584
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:19,022
I want him back.

585
01:04:20,232 --> 01:04:24,319
I can't do it myself,
or I would.

586
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:27,990
I need you, Castle.

587
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:32,578
I'll give you anything you want.
I'll do anything you wish.

588
01:04:34,746 --> 01:04:36,874
Say something.

589
01:04:36,957 --> 01:04:39,209
Fuck you.

590
01:04:40,586 --> 01:04:43,005
Let me put it another way.

591
01:04:55,893 --> 01:04:57,853
A life for a life.

592
01:04:57,936 --> 01:05:01,189
I'm not going
to ask you twice, Castle.

593
01:05:04,693 --> 01:05:05,944
Well?

594
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:18,206
Okay.
Okay, I'll do it.

595
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:20,375
But understand...

596
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:24,296
When this is over, you're dead.

597
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:38,727
The elevator stops at 40.
They're on 41.

598
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:42,314
We need a key to get there,
which the lobby guard has in the lobby.

599
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:44,566
Five minutes.
Push the first button.

600
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:46,652
What's that going to do?

601
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:53,408
- Blow out the lights.
Sir, just in case,

602
01:05:53,492 --> 01:05:56,620
It's been an honor
to have known you.

603
01:05:57,746 --> 01:05:59,706
Likewise.

604
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:02,626
Castle, here's some
body armor for you.

605
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:04,419
Just in case.

606
01:06:04,503 --> 01:06:06,672
Here. Just in case.

607
01:06:07,506 --> 01:06:09,591
Have it your way.

608
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:13,011
15 minutes.

609
01:06:13,095 --> 01:06:16,974
- You hit the second button.
- What's that going to blow out?

610
01:06:17,057 --> 01:06:19,017
Everything else.

611
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:27,776
Hey.

612
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:32,489
- I got to take a leak.
- Be my guest.

613
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:34,241
That's fine.

614
01:06:35,826 --> 01:06:39,955
I don't know what the boss will say
about a yellow stain on the seat.

615
01:06:46,795 --> 01:06:51,049
Hey, hey, man!
That's skin back there. Take it easy.

616
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:53,385
What?

617
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:58,181
Are you going to handle
the equipment for me?

618
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:04,813
In front.

619
01:07:04,896 --> 01:07:07,190
- Can I ask you a question?
- What?

620
01:07:07,274 --> 01:07:09,359
Is an IQ test
required for this job?

621
01:07:09,443 --> 01:07:10,652
No.

622
01:07:13,739 --> 01:07:15,782
I didn't think so.

623
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:19,453
Hey, man, I got the pizza.

624
01:08:56,925 --> 01:08:59,136
Can I ask you a question?

625
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:03,181
What's the reason behind
you killing all those guys?

626
01:09:04,266 --> 01:09:06,434
There's a limit to revenge.

627
01:09:06,518 --> 01:09:09,187
Well, I guess,
I haven't reached mine yet.

628
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:52,606
Which way?

629
01:09:55,025 --> 01:09:56,151
Not that way.

630
01:11:21,152 --> 01:11:22,988
You go that way.

631
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:05,358
You all right?

632
01:14:05,442 --> 01:14:07,986
Don't worry
about this poor, old slob.

633
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:09,988
Get on the case.
Do the job.

634
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:11,656
Hey,hey,
Take care of this guy.

635
01:14:11,739 --> 01:14:15,034
I'll operate under my own steam.
Thank you.

636
01:14:27,881 --> 01:14:29,507
Here. Hold this.

637
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:47,942
-
<i>'</i> Dad!

638
01:14:49,486 --> 01:14:50,653
Tommy!

639
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:56,493
How long is it gonna take
to get an elevator?

640
01:14:56,576 --> 01:14:57,869
It's hard to say.

641
01:14:57,952 --> 01:14:59,829
Elevators are
very temperamental things.

642
01:14:59,913 --> 01:15:02,081
So are cops who don't like being jerked around.
Now how long?

643
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:05,251
- 10 minutes.
- How long? Hey, how long?

644
01:15:05,335 --> 01:15:07,003
Uh, five minutes?

645
01:15:08,922 --> 01:15:11,257
Ah, Mr. Franco.

646
01:15:11,341 --> 01:15:13,968
How nice to see you again.

647
01:15:14,052 --> 01:15:16,012
Let him go.

648
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:19,933
You've gotten everything
you wanted.

649
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:23,061
Not quite yet.

650
01:16:52,275 --> 01:16:55,153
Take another step, Mr. Franco.

651
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:57,113
Well, you can't win here.

652
01:16:57,196 --> 01:17:00,908
- You kill him, I kill you.
- And who loses more?

653
01:17:00,992 --> 01:17:03,453
Certainly not me.

654
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:15,715
- What do you want?
- On your knees.

655
01:17:17,467 --> 01:17:19,552
On your knees!

656
01:17:24,265 --> 01:17:26,726
Put the gun in your mouth.

657
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:32,649
You have my word he will live.

658
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:36,986
- How do I know you'll keep it?
- You don't.

659
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:39,822
But some chance is better
than no chance.

660
01:17:46,746 --> 01:17:51,334
All the way in.
Pull that trigger, Mr. Franco.

661
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:52,794
NOW! Now!

662
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:55,922
This is part of your education.
You watch.

663
01:17:56,881 --> 01:17:58,966
Goodbye, Mr. Franco.

664
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:20,947
All right, guys. Let's go.

665
01:18:23,783 --> 01:18:25,785
Tommy?

666
01:18:25,868 --> 01:18:26,661
Dad!

667
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:29,080
Tommy!

668
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:32,834
Let me have a look at you.
Care to walk?

669
01:18:32,917 --> 01:18:35,378
- Yeah.
- Okay. Come on.

670
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:46,431
Wait outside, my son.

671
01:18:46,514 --> 01:18:48,349
Come on.
I'll see to him.

672
01:18:48,433 --> 01:18:51,144
- I can help him.
- Wait outside, Tommy.

673
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:07,618
I must compliment you, Castle.

674
01:19:07,702 --> 01:19:10,538
You've clone something
I never dreamed possible.

675
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:13,291
You've wiped out
the competition.

676
01:19:13,374 --> 01:19:16,335
Thanks to you,
there's only me.

677
01:19:16,419 --> 01:19:19,005
In five years' time,
my new organization...

678
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:22,759
will be the most powerful
crime syndicate on earth...

679
01:19:22,842 --> 01:19:27,680
and that boy whose life you saved
will inherit all of it.

680
01:19:28,431 --> 01:19:31,476
And the only thing
he will have to fear...

681
01:19:31,559 --> 01:19:34,145
I'm about to eliminate.

682
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:40,276
You gave me back my son.
Thank you very much.

683
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:42,820
I'm in your debt.

684
01:19:43,988 --> 01:19:46,741
- See you in hell, Castle.
- Dad!

685
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:48,910
Tommy!

686
01:20:41,629 --> 01:20:43,005
Dad, Stop!

687
01:20:43,589 --> 01:20:45,383
<i>Swap'-!</i>

688
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:49,887
Dad, get off him!

689
01:21:33,139 --> 01:21:34,515
Dad?

690
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:36,183
Dad...

691
01:21:53,576 --> 01:21:55,536
I'm going to kill you.

692
01:22:01,876 --> 01:22:02,793
Good.

693
01:22:04,211 --> 01:22:07,131
Maybe if you get it
over with now...

694
01:22:07,798 --> 01:22:10,801
you won't grow up
to be like him.

695
01:22:20,937 --> 01:22:22,688
Come on.

696
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:25,024
Do it.

697
01:22:25,608 --> 01:22:27,318
Do it.

698
01:22:30,321 --> 01:22:32,073
Do it.

699
01:22:46,712 --> 01:22:48,130
What the hell?

700
01:22:48,214 --> 01:22:49,090
Whoa...

701
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:51,467
All right. Split up.

702
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:52,635
Frank?

703
01:22:53,344 --> 01:22:55,054
Frank?

704
01:23:04,355 --> 01:23:06,732
You're a good boy, Tommy.

705
01:23:07,775 --> 01:23:10,528
Grow up to be a good man.

706
01:23:18,703 --> 01:23:20,788
Because if not...

707
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:23,499
I'll be waiting.

708
01:23:39,181 --> 01:23:41,225
Are you all right?

709
01:23:42,184 --> 01:23:44,603
Which way did he go?

710
01:24:08,544 --> 01:24:09,754
Frank!

711
01:24:14,717 --> 01:24:16,469
Frank!

712
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:29,023
I still talk to God sometimes.

713
01:24:29,106 --> 01:24:33,277
I ask him if what I'm doing
is right or wrong.

714
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,447
I'm still waiting for an answer.

715
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:39,700
And until I get one,
I'll be out here.

716
01:24:39,784 --> 01:24:42,953
Waiting.
Watching.

717
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:46,624
The guilty will be punished.
