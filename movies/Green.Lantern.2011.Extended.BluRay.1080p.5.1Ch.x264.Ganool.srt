
1
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,242
Billions of years ago...

2
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:40,039
...a race of immortals harnessed
the most powerful force in existence:

3
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,667
The emerald energy of willpower.

4
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,253
These immortals,
the Guardians of the Universe...

5
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,798
...built a world from where they could
watch over all of existence:

6
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,343
The planet Oa.

7
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:57,431
They divided the universe
into 3600 sectors.

8
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:03,103
A ring powered by the energy of will
was sent to every sector to select a recruit.

9
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:08,650
In order to be chosen by the ring,
it was said one must be without fear.

10
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,779
Together, these 3600 recruits...

11
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:17,910
...formed the intergalactic peacekeepers
known as the Green Lantern Corps.

12
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,630
Of all the threats the Corps ever faced...

13
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:33,967
...the gravest was an entity of fear
known as Parallax.

14
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,679
Only the Iegendary Green Lantern
Abin Sur...

15
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:40,182
...was capable of capturing
and imprisoning this beast...

16
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,144
...which he did on the Iost planet of Ryut.

17
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:08,043
COMMANDER :

18
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,610
You are afraid.

19
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,737
Good.

20
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,825
- I mean, we go into this every time.
- It"s not every time.

21
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:48,787
No, honey. Think back.
Think back. Think back.

22
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,458
I was fine the Iast time. I"m usually fine.
I"m fine with your work.

23
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,462
- Can I just tell you something?
- Of course you can.

24
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:01,175
- I"m scared, honey.
- Shh, shh.

25
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,326
Is everything okay?

26
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:31,205
Oh, you know how Mom gets
the night before a test flight.

27
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,542
But you"re not scared, are you, Dad?

28
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,798
Let"s just say it"s my job not to be.

29
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,470
Good night, son.

30
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,602
Hal, you"re gonna be Iate.

31
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,897
Good morning, Mom. Gotta go.

32
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,104
Dad! Dad! Dad!

33
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:27,321
- You think she"II break mach 3?
- We"II find out soon enough.

34
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,573
Hey, shouldn"t you be in school?

35
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,701
Mr. Ferris raised the rear stabilizer.

36
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:34,995
Yes, he did.

37
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,248
The yaw rate gyros are calibrated,
but the pitch is off 2 degrees.

38
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,418
- I can Iive with that. How about the INS?
- Good to go.

39
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,795
- Okay.
- Johnny.

40
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,464
- Be sure to check the ignition sequences.
- No problem.

41
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,049
- We did, Carl, twice.
- Right.

42
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:50,511
And, uh, the gyros?
Did we do the gyro calibrations?

43
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,687
Hey, Carl.

44
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,898
Maybe Hal would Iike to join Carol
up in your office.

45
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:07,736
- The two of them can watch together.
- Come on, young man. Let"s go find Carol.

46
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,029
Hal.

47
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,495
Keep it warm for me.

48
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:23,335
- Hi.
- Oh, hey, Hector.

49
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:27,631
Hey. So, um, I have this book.

50
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,217
It"s about the possibility
of Iife on other planets.

51
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,263
- Cool.
- Well, it almost has to exist, but--

52
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,765
- Hal!
- Hey, Carol.

53
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,643
Hector. You still wanna
trade Hot Wheels?

54
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,228
Sure.

55
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,524
Well, Iook who"s here.
Our future test pilot.

56
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,359
Jacket suits you, son.

57
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:48,902
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey.

58
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,114
I keep telling Hector, books are fun,
but every once in a while...

59
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,576
...it"s not such a bad idea to get
out in the world, right, Hal?

60
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,287
- Hey, Bob.
- The man of the hour.

61
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,373
Nothing Iike a first flight
to get the blood boiling, eh, Carl?

62
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,542
Dad, can we watch
from down in the field?

63
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,377
- Sure.
- Yes!

64
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,672
You kids be careful.
Stay with the engineers.

65
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,799
Go on, son. See it up close.

66
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:14,136
That"s okay, Dad. I"II be fine.

67
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,307
Ferris Tower, Sabre One,
ready for take-off.

68
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,310
Request unrestricted climb,
flight Ievel 450.

69
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,526
Yes! Yes!

70
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,029
Sabre One,
unrestricted climb approved.

71
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,782
On passing 10,000 feet,
contact Ferris Departure.

72
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,951
You"re cleared for take-off.
Good Iuck, Sabre.

73
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,405
Whoo! Yeah, Dad!

74
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:57,776
Sinestro, I"m traveling at maximum velocity.
Tell Fentara I should--

75
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,403
Fentara is dead.

76
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,949
The planet"s inhabitants?

77
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,577
Your mission to evacuate them
is no Ionger necessary.

78
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,204
It"s just as it was on Talok.

79
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,624
Every Iife form destroyed
and their essence absorbed.

80
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:14,960
Traces of yellow power everywhere.

81
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,462
And the Guardians?

82
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,089
The Guardians are silent.

83
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,300
I"ve demanded an audience with them.

84
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,436
Abin Sur.

85
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:25,614
I"m badly wounded.

86
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:30,661
Heading to the nearest inhabited planet
for the selection process.

87
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:34,498
Tell the Guardians it"s Parallax.

88
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,682
No. No.

89
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,357
Sorry, I gotta run.
Make yourself at home, okay?

90
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,276
There"s, uh, water in the tap.

91
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:28,635
No!

92
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,471
Yup.

93
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:37,019
Asshole.

94
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:43,692
The Ferris Sabre I I I is state-of-the-art
of artificial-intelligence fighter planes.

95
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,696
It has all of the flying and combat
capability of a human pilot...

96
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,991
...but with none of the human error
that comes with it.

97
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:54,161
Carl isn"t just blowing smoke
to get a contract, general.

98
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,372
Your staff, these contractors, my office...

99
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,916
...we"ve all been part of this
from the ground up.

100
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,918
Well, I appreciate that, senator.

101
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:03,170
But today the rubber meets the road.

102
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:08,342
We have a simulated combat situation.
Two Sabres against Carl"s two best pilots.

103
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,945
Carol. Was gonna do a Iittle flying today.
What do you think?

104
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:29,363
I think you"re Iate.

105
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,615
Yes, but that"s only because I slept in.

106
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,784
I used to sleep in. Then I turned 11.

107
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,828
Let me give you a Iittle heads-up.

108
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,415
I"ve gone up against these Sabres all week
and they smoked me every time.

109
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,960
There isn"t anything you can do that
they can"t do better, faster...

110
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,421
...and without disappointing women
everywhere.

111
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,965
I, uh, think we both know that"s not true.

112
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:51,552
This is exactly why I didn"t want you
for this. My father did.

113
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,137
I would"ve gone with Jensen.

114
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:56,974
I"d have too, but unfortunately
he"s busy not being good enough.

115
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:58,684
At Ieast he shows up.

116
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,352
Hal...

117
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,479
...this test today, it"s important.

118
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:05,482
I"m gonna make you Iook good up there.
Don"t worry, okay?

119
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,278
Now Iet"s get these pants off
and fly some planes.

120
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,158
Highball, weapon check now.

121
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,659
Roger that.

122
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,789
- Good morning, Mr. Ferris.
- Morning, everybody.

123
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
Gentlemen.

124
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:28,005
- We about ready, Tom?
- Yes, Mr. Ferris. We are go for test.

125
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,175
Sapphire, cleared weapons hot
at the merge.

126
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:33,969
Ferris Test, Sapphire. Weapons are hot.

127
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,929
Fly safe, Highball.

128
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,182
Um, no.

129
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,862
Goddamn it!
Tom, what the hell you feed those things?

130
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,697
F-35s, what else?

131
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,831
Wakey, wakey, Sapphire.

132
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,000
You got a shot,
now would be a great time.

133
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:08,087
Easy, Highball. Just Iining it up.

134
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,228
There"s no way
we"re taking these out solo.

135
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:26,647
Get over here.
Let"s figure something out.

136
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:29,149
On my way, Highball.

137
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:36,824
Now stay right there and Iook real pretty.

138
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:02,516
Highball, did you just use your wingman
as a decoy?

139
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:28,625
Highball, those Sabres headed up your 6
can fly anywhere you can.

140
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,711
Then Iet"s go somewhere I can"t fly.

141
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,717
What the hell is he up to?

142
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,260
Coffin corner.

143
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:43,140
Highball, rules of engagement
set ceiling at 50,000 feet.

144
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:46,602
Yeah, because the Sabres will stall
if they go any higher, right, Tom?

145
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,978
And so will you.

146
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,320
Compressor stall. Compressor stall.

147
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:35,359
Yes!

148
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:43,200
Um, I mean, damn it, Hal.

149
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:45,994
Your boy certainly
takes his job seriously.

150
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:49,623
Ailerons, Hal. Side to side.

151
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,833
I got it.

152
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:56,296
Hal.

153
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,220
Keep it warm for me.

154
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,016
Going through 25,000.

155
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,393
Hey, you okay, Highball?

156
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:12,229
Yeah, just taking my victory Iap.

157
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:22,573
- Going through 20,000.
- Okay, Highball, give me some roll.

158
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,373
Yeah, Dad!

159
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:34,043
Hal, do you read me?

160
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:46,764
Highball, you"re approaching
minimum ejection altitude.

161
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,605
Highball, you"re below 10,000 AGL.
Spin is unrecoverable.

162
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:57,191
Eject, eject, eject!

163
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,361
You"re not scared, are you, Dad?

164
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:03,364
Let"s just say it"s my job not to be.

165
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:10,454
Dad!

166
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:15,376
Dad!

167
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,980
You stupid son of a bitch. You--

168
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:39,191
Stand down, Bob. It doesn"t matter now.

169
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,526
It does matter.

170
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:43,612
Never mind that you crashed
a brand-new F-35.

171
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,657
You broke the rules of engagement.
You sacrificed your wingman.

172
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:49,451
And you blew the contract
this company was depending on.

173
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,578
I"m sorry. I thought this was a dogfight.

174
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:54,248
I was under the impression
the objective was to win.

175
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,501
No, the objective was to show
what the Sabres could do in combat.

176
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:00,629
And in combat,
no pilot is gonna crater his own plane.

177
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:02,464
I did.

178
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:07,011
Now you know you gotta boost the ceiling.
I showed you what they can"t do.

179
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:09,847
You didn"t have to make that point
in front ofAir Force Acquisitions.

180
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:11,265
That"s enough, Carol.

181
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:16,979
Since I"m gonna have to Iay off most of
my company anyway, you"re fired, Hal.

182
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:18,272
It"s too Iate. I quit.

183
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,065
He"s not fired and you don"t quit.

184
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,860
You"re grounded,
pending the results of an investigation.

185
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:32,036
Watch your back.

186
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:33,662
That"s impossible, Bob.

187
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:43,047
- Tell me what happened.
- Controls Iocked up.

188
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:46,633
Don"t give me that, Hal. You had a
window when you could"ve recovered.

189
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:48,344
Did you choke?

190
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:50,637
You wouldn"t be the first,
but I need to know.

191
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:53,515
My controls Iocked up.
What the hell is all this, anyway?

192
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:55,184
What"s with the ridiculous suit?

193
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:59,104
- I know your dad"s been bucking for you--
- The merits of my career choices--

194
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:03,484
You"re a pilot, and a good one.
Giving that up to fly a desk is bullshit.

195
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:04,985
I Iike it and I"m good at it.

196
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:08,864
Doesn"t mean I"II never get in a cockpit
again. It isn"t one way or the other.

197
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:12,451
That"s the way a child Iooks at things,
and we aren"t children anymore.

198
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:15,496
At Ieast....

199
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:22,670
I just don"t wanna see
someone I care about getting hurt.

200
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:25,422
Least of all you.

201
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:05,754
Choose well.

202
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,157
A test pilot"s daring maneuvers
almost ended in tragedy.

203
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:37,786
Witnesses say pilot Hal Jordan
ejected at the Iast possible second...

204
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:40,039
...before his jet crashed
in the open desert.

205
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:42,124
He"s the son of the Iate Martin Jordan...

206
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:45,336
...who was killed in his own
ill-fated test flight back in 1993.

207
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:48,047
We are told that Hal Jordan
is doing fine right now...

208
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:51,050
...though we have yet to hear
an official statement.

209
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:52,259
Hey, guys.

210
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:56,013
The incident has been a blow
to a new high-tech aircraft program....

211
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:57,598
Hey. How was work?

212
00:25:57,766 --> 00:26:00,351
Oh. It was amazing, Jack.
Thank you for asking. Hey, Janice.

213
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:03,645
Just help me out here, because
I"m really trying to understand this.

214
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:05,689
- Mm-hm.
- Do you wanna be Iike him so bad?

215
00:26:05,857 --> 00:26:08,108
- You just assume it"s my fault.
- I talked to Carl.

216
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:10,402
- Oh. Heh, heh.
- You pushed the plane past its Iimits--

217
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,364
That"s my job. It was an accident.
Everybody walked away.

218
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:17,034
Like your motorcycle accident
that put you in the hospital for a month?

219
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:19,912
I miss all this quality family time.
Good talk, Jack.

220
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:33,759
Where"s Jason?

221
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:35,886
In his room.

222
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:37,596
Why?

223
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:41,934
Hey, it"s Uncle Hal.

224
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:44,186
What"s up there, ace?

225
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:48,107
This is the worst 11th birthday party
I"ve ever been to.

226
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,693
No dancing girls?
What"s going on--? Hey.

227
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:53,195
Hey.

228
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:55,656
I"m fine.

229
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:58,200
I guess I got a Iittle freaked out
or something.

230
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:00,244
It happens.

231
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:01,495
Not to you.

232
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:03,414
Look...

233
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:06,291
...you don"t have anything
to worry about.

234
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:07,501
You wanna know why?

235
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,505
Yeah, I may be a total screw-up
in every other part of my Iife...

236
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:15,718
...but the one thing I do know
how to do is fly.

237
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:20,139
You know, I used to know this kid.

238
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:22,766
Was a funny-Iooking Iittle bastard.

239
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:26,854
One day, he"s standing on the mound,
and he throws a perfect game.

240
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:30,024
That-- That was me.

241
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,067
That was you?

242
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:36,447
Thought you Iooked familiar.

243
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:42,119
You were totally in the zone that day.
Remember?

244
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:46,874
- I still dream about it.
- I bet.

245
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:49,626
Take it.

246
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:51,587
Close your eyes.

247
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:54,131
Go on.

248
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:01,138
Now...

249
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,433
...can you remember
exactly how you felt that day?

250
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:09,813
That"s how I feel when I"m flying.

251
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:12,441
Like that plane is a part of me.

252
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:16,820
No, it"s Iike,
no matter how bad things get...

253
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,492
...there"s something good out there...

254
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,994
...just over the horizon.

255
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,876
I could really feel it.

256
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:33,962
Yeah.

257
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,548
Me too.

258
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:48,977
Hey, got you something, birthday boy.
Wrapped it myself.

259
00:28:54,526 --> 00:28:56,360
Cool. It"s an X-1, right?

260
00:28:56,528 --> 00:28:59,613
It"s a Starfighter. My dad gave me that.

261
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:01,448
Let"s put it up.

262
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,285
What happened today?

263
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:07,121
I mean, when you crashed.

264
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:09,206
Not really sure, exactly.

265
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:12,626
Were you scared?

266
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:16,463
It"s my job not to be.

267
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:21,969
You know, you"re totally missing
your super-Iame birthday party.

268
00:29:22,137 --> 00:29:25,723
Beat it. Go, go, go!

269
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:30,144
I"m glad you"re okay.

270
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:35,566
Me too, ace.

271
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:51,081
Get off! No!

272
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:55,669
Aah! No!

273
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:01,193
Come on, stay with me. Stay with me.
I"m gonna get you some help.

274
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:04,863
You"re gonna be okay.
You"re gonna be okay. Okay, hold on.

275
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:07,324
Your name. Your name.

276
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:10,160
It"s Hal. Hal Jordan.

277
00:31:10,328 --> 00:31:15,249
Hal Jordan, I am Abin Sur,
protector of Sector 2814.

278
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:16,667
Okay, hey, Iisten.

279
00:31:16,835 --> 00:31:22,297
We"re gonna get you to a hospital, okay?
Okay? One that carries purple blood.

280
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:24,883
The ring...

281
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:26,552
...it chose you.

282
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,220
Take it!

283
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:32,641
Place the ring in the Iantern.

284
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:35,394
Place the ring, speak the oath....

285
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:38,022
- What?
- Great honor, responsibility....

286
00:31:38,189 --> 00:31:40,774
I don"t understand.
Breathe. You gotta breathe, okay?

287
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:43,402
AII you gotta do is breathe.
Just breathe, okay?

288
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:46,071
Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no.
Hey, hey.

289
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:50,075
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, man.
No, no, no, don"t do that.

290
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:54,038
Hey, now, don"t do that.

291
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:56,915
Oh, come on.

292
00:32:09,304 --> 00:32:12,598
X-97 systems check complete.

293
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:19,271
Yo.

294
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:22,858
Come again?

295
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:41,960
Hmm.

296
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,088
Is that a spaceship?

297
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:45,798
Yeah.

298
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:48,467
Is it real?

299
00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:50,803
It"s real.

300
00:32:51,304 --> 00:32:53,806
Did you see what kind of power source
this thing uses?

301
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:55,766
- Do you understand--?
- We can"t stay.

302
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:57,184
- We can"t stay here.
- What?

303
00:32:57,352 --> 00:32:59,228
- Gotta go.
- What?

304
00:32:59,938 --> 00:33:00,979
Pilot.

305
00:33:01,314 --> 00:33:04,233
He wore a uniform.
I think he was a soldier.

306
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:06,235
He gave me this.

307
00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:07,945
He proposed?

308
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,744
We"re gone. We"re gone, now!

309
00:33:31,261 --> 00:33:34,763
They"re gonna know someone was there.
Alien pilots don"t bury themselves.

310
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:36,515
I couldn"t just Ieave him there.

311
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:39,309
I hope this thing isn"t radioactive.

312
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:42,521
- Yeah, well, you"re the genius. You-- Aah!
- Aah!

313
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:44,356
- Jesus!
- Aah! Whoa!

314
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:48,944
Got it!

315
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:53,657
He said that the ring chose me.

316
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:57,202
He said it was a great honor.
Responsibility.

317
00:33:57,662 --> 00:33:58,704
Responsibility?

318
00:33:58,872 --> 00:33:59,872
- Yeah.
- You?

319
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:06,211
Well, maybe on their planet
""responsibility"" just means ""asshole.""

320
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:08,547
Let"s hope so.

321
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:24,730
A great Iight has gone out
in the universe.

322
00:34:25,315 --> 00:34:27,316
Abin Sur is dead.

323
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:32,988
Four of my Lantern brothers killed.

324
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:37,576
The inhabitants of two worlds
annihilated by an unknown enemy.

325
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:40,871
An enemy that possesses
the yellow power of fear.

326
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:48,796
We know it originated from
within the Lost Sector.

327
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:52,383
We know it grows more powerful
with each encounter.

328
00:34:53,343 --> 00:34:57,763
According to Abin Sur"s Iast transmission,
he seemed to know what it was.

329
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,850
His only words were, ""It"s Parallax.""

330
00:35:08,483 --> 00:35:12,403
We are aware of the threat.
We are assessing the situation.

331
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:17,241
While you assess,
innocent Iives will be Iost.

332
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:19,284
Let me take the fight to this enemy.

333
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:22,955
There is much of which
you are not aware, Sinestro.

334
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:25,874
If the danger is as great as we suspect--

335
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:27,793
What are you saying?

336
00:35:28,628 --> 00:35:31,255
You believe this enemy can defeat us?

337
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:44,643
Guardians, if your faith in our power
has faltered, Iet me renew it.

338
00:35:45,103 --> 00:35:48,439
Let me take a squadron of my strongest
Lanterns against this enemy...

339
00:35:48,606 --> 00:35:52,568
...and I"II prove to you
our best days are not behind us.

340
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:34,735
Dr. Hammond?

341
00:36:35,904 --> 00:36:37,363
Dr. Hector Hammond?

342
00:36:38,365 --> 00:36:40,532
We need to ask you to come with us.

343
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:45,496
Did Adam put you up to this?

344
00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:03,055
Get out of the car, please.

345
00:37:33,044 --> 00:37:34,420
Whoa.

346
00:37:49,894 --> 00:37:51,103
Dr. Hammond?

347
00:37:51,521 --> 00:37:52,688
Dr. Amanda Waller.

348
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:57,568
I must apologize for the theatrics,
but the government does Iike its protocols.

349
00:37:57,736 --> 00:37:59,528
Please, follow me.

350
00:38:21,468 --> 00:38:23,677
Is that what I think it is?

351
00:38:23,845 --> 00:38:26,472
An alien Iife form, doctor.

352
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:29,099
The first that mankind
has ever encountered...

353
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:32,686
...despite what the conspiracy theorists
would have you believe.

354
00:38:32,854 --> 00:38:36,565
We want you to do the initial assessment
of its physiology.

355
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:38,609
My God.

356
00:38:41,654 --> 00:38:42,946
Why me?

357
00:38:43,114 --> 00:38:46,575
As a xenobiologist, your skills are
specifically suited to the task.

358
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:47,826
Beyond that...

359
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:49,745
...I"m not at Iiberty to tell you.

360
00:38:52,165 --> 00:38:53,791
Hello.

361
00:39:25,073 --> 00:39:30,369
The eyes, nose, ears and mouth
are humanoid.

362
00:39:30,537 --> 00:39:34,832
In the Ieft anterior thoracic region
is a 1 0-centimeter wound...

363
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,627
...with jagged edges containing attached
cyanotic-colored coagulum.

364
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:40,546
Okay, all right.

365
00:39:40,714 --> 00:39:43,382
Place the ring, then speak the oath.

366
00:39:46,052 --> 00:39:47,553
The oath.

367
00:39:47,846 --> 00:39:50,055
Because everybody knows the oath.

368
00:39:50,473 --> 00:39:52,891
Used to sing it in camp.

369
00:39:55,895 --> 00:39:59,565
I, Hal Jordan...

370
00:40:00,108 --> 00:40:02,359
...do solemnly swear...

371
00:40:02,527 --> 00:40:05,404
...to pledge allegiance...

372
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:07,322
...to a Iantern...

373
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:11,326
...that I got from a dying purple alien...

374
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:13,495
...in a swamp.

375
00:40:13,663 --> 00:40:15,581
The epidermis is magenta.

376
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:18,625
It appears transparent
and is extremely thin...

377
00:40:18,793 --> 00:40:24,048
...allowing visualization of muscles
and individual muscle fibers.

378
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:28,218
""To infinity and beyond.""

379
00:40:28,553 --> 00:40:31,096
""By the power of Grayskull.""

380
00:40:31,264 --> 00:40:32,765
What the hell?!

381
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:36,602
If you can fly me 100 miles in the middle
of nowhere, you"d think that you--

382
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,771
No!

383
00:40:50,408 --> 00:40:54,703
In brightest day, in blackest night...

384
00:40:55,038 --> 00:40:57,998
...no evil shall escape my sight.

385
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:01,627
Let those who worship evil"s might...

386
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:08,634
...beware my power:

387
00:41:09,594 --> 00:41:10,803
Green Lantern"s Iight.

388
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:31,824
Carol.

389
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:35,077
- Everything okay in there?
- It"s fine.

390
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:36,912
Well, can I come in?

391
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,163
No.

392
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:40,916
Yeah, no, because we"re--
Uh, do you wanna get a drink?

393
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:43,127
- Can we talk?
- Yeah.

394
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:45,921
We can talk and drink.

395
00:41:57,017 --> 00:41:58,892
- My initial analysis.
- Thank you, doctor.

396
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:04,648
I don"t need to tell you that the mere fact
that it"s humanoid is extraordinary.

397
00:42:04,816 --> 00:42:09,820
It"s indicating a convergent evolution,
or perhaps a common ancestry...

398
00:42:09,988 --> 00:42:13,365
...and the implications of that
are staggering.

399
00:42:13,533 --> 00:42:16,118
I mean, where did it come from?

400
00:42:16,286 --> 00:42:19,538
This could completely change the way
that the world views itself.

401
00:42:19,706 --> 00:42:22,791
You imagine the way that the public
will react to this?

402
00:42:23,543 --> 00:42:26,628
Um, but I know that
that won"t happen. I do.

403
00:42:26,796 --> 00:42:29,798
Like yourself, doctor,
I"m a seeker of truth.

404
00:42:29,966 --> 00:42:32,509
But the people who pay for facilities
Iike this...

405
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:35,387
...have other priorities
and the power to enforce them.

406
00:42:35,555 --> 00:42:37,389
So I keep it a secret.

407
00:42:37,557 --> 00:42:40,225
People Iike us have to work
within the system, doctor.

408
00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:43,020
We do the best we can.

409
00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:46,231
Right.

410
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,778
Pick that up.

411
00:42:53,448 --> 00:42:55,074
I, um...

412
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:57,159
I"m really sorry.

413
00:42:57,911 --> 00:42:59,953
Did you just apologize?

414
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:03,832
You haven"t been replaced by an alien
or something?

415
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:05,668
No.

416
00:43:06,252 --> 00:43:07,336
I"m good.

417
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:10,089
Ah. I"m good.

418
00:43:10,423 --> 00:43:13,092
I"m good, totally good. Uh...

419
00:43:16,429 --> 00:43:17,763
Do you think I"m irresponsible?

420
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,062
No need to answer. That"s fine.

421
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:27,481
Hal. Ha, ha.

422
00:43:32,153 --> 00:43:33,904
You Iook pretty.

423
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:40,619
And we haven"t been in this place
together since...

424
00:43:41,621 --> 00:43:42,746
...that night.

425
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:46,458
- You forgot it was my birthday.
- Did I?

426
00:43:46,626 --> 00:43:47,960
Mm.

427
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:51,797
That was also the night--
The first time that we ever...

428
00:43:53,299 --> 00:43:54,925
...flew together.

429
00:43:57,637 --> 00:44:00,889
You"ve been flying ever since
with anyone who"d get in the plane.

430
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:09,481
Oh, yeah.

431
00:44:09,941 --> 00:44:11,316
- Oh, no.
- Come on.

432
00:44:11,484 --> 00:44:12,985
- No, yeah, Iet"s go.
- Mm-mm.

433
00:44:13,153 --> 00:44:15,654
- Dance with me.
- No.

434
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:24,246
No.

435
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:26,331
Hal. No.

436
00:44:29,919 --> 00:44:30,961
No.

437
00:44:36,468 --> 00:44:38,344
I really am sorry.

438
00:44:38,511 --> 00:44:42,389
Oh. It"s okay.
The contract isn"t quite dead yet.

439
00:44:42,557 --> 00:44:43,974
I told you I was good at this.

440
00:44:44,142 --> 00:44:46,685
I wasn"t talking about the contract.

441
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:54,276
I would"ve screwed this up. You know?

442
00:44:55,111 --> 00:44:57,488
Even if I didn"t go to the Air Force...

443
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:00,824
...I would"ve found some way to. ...

444
00:45:01,826 --> 00:45:04,620
- You and me, I would"ve blown it.
- Yeah, is that what you tell yourself?

445
00:45:04,788 --> 00:45:06,997
Mm. What do you tell yourself?

446
00:45:10,627 --> 00:45:13,337
That you were scared
I was getting too close.

447
00:45:16,883 --> 00:45:19,468
You know what I spent
my afternoon doing?

448
00:45:19,636 --> 00:45:21,095
What?

449
00:45:21,429 --> 00:45:23,430
Worrying about you.

450
00:45:25,058 --> 00:45:29,853
I went over every inch of the flight data.
There was nothing wrong with the plane.

451
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:33,524
- What happened up there?
- Thanks for the dance.

452
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:04,096
I told you to watch your back.

453
00:46:04,514 --> 00:46:07,558
You cost us all ourjobs,
you son of a bitch.

454
00:46:26,953 --> 00:46:28,454
Pathetic.

455
00:46:28,913 --> 00:46:32,458
Bastard"s been Iiving off his old man"s
reputation his whole Iife.

456
00:46:38,506 --> 00:46:39,965
Hey.

457
00:46:40,884 --> 00:46:42,384
Hey!

458
00:46:43,636 --> 00:46:45,554
My face is just getting warmed up.

459
00:50:34,868 --> 00:50:36,827
Whoa.

460
00:50:54,387 --> 00:50:56,805
Have you concluded admiring yourself?

461
00:50:56,973 --> 00:50:58,474
Uh. ...

462
00:50:58,641 --> 00:50:59,808
Yeah.

463
00:50:59,976 --> 00:51:03,771
Well, your ring translator
is functioning properly.

464
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:07,149
Your mask will appear when protection
of your identity is required.

465
00:51:07,317 --> 00:51:09,026
There is no need for it on Oa.

466
00:51:09,444 --> 00:51:11,070
A talking fish.

467
00:51:11,237 --> 00:51:12,905
Actually, my race is Xudarian.

468
00:51:13,073 --> 00:51:16,575
Our DNA does somewhat resemble
your own ichthyological species.

469
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:20,996
I am Tomar-Re, protector of Sector 2813
and home to--

470
00:51:21,164 --> 00:51:25,668
80,012 galaxies,
2.34 million sentient species.

471
00:51:26,544 --> 00:51:27,628
How do I know that?

472
00:51:27,796 --> 00:51:29,421
The induction process.

473
00:51:29,589 --> 00:51:34,051
It activates the ring"s higher functions,
including a working knowledge base.

474
00:51:34,219 --> 00:51:35,427
In truth, we were curious.

475
00:51:35,595 --> 00:51:40,099
The process had never been attempted on
a species as young as humans before.

476
00:51:42,227 --> 00:51:47,272
As you are the first to be chosen,
I"ve been sent to welcome you here.

477
00:51:48,566 --> 00:51:50,984
And here is?

478
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:57,032
Welcome to Oa.

479
00:52:01,413 --> 00:52:04,957
This planet has been our home
for countless millennia.

480
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:08,127
It was created for us by the Guardians.

481
00:52:08,294 --> 00:52:09,962
Guardians?

482
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:11,922
There stands their Citadel.

483
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:15,718
They are immortals,
among the most ancient of races.

484
00:52:15,885 --> 00:52:20,139
They made all you see
and are responsible for all we are and do.

485
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:23,308
Since time immemorial,
the Green Lantern Corps...

486
00:52:23,476 --> 00:52:28,313
...has served as the keepers of peace,
order and justice throughout the universe.

487
00:52:28,732 --> 00:52:32,568
To be chosen to join its ranks
is the highest of honors...

488
00:52:32,736 --> 00:52:35,070
...and the greatest of responsibilities.

489
00:52:35,238 --> 00:52:37,740
Yeah. Yeah, that part I heard about.

490
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:39,742
We"re going to fly now.

491
00:52:41,995 --> 00:52:44,121
- Fly?
- Absolutely.

492
00:52:45,248 --> 00:52:46,915
AII right.

493
00:52:47,625 --> 00:52:49,668
I can do that.

494
00:52:54,674 --> 00:52:56,133
Join me.

495
00:52:57,802 --> 00:52:59,678
I can do that.

496
00:53:11,775 --> 00:53:13,442
Yeah!

497
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:17,738
Whoa!

498
00:53:48,853 --> 00:53:50,270
What is that?

499
00:53:50,438 --> 00:53:53,357
It"s the energy
that"s generated from the Central Battery.

500
00:53:53,525 --> 00:53:57,027
Its power comes from the will
of every Iiving creature in the universe.

501
00:53:57,445 --> 00:54:02,408
It, in turn, charges your Iantern,
which, in turn, charges your ring.

502
00:54:02,575 --> 00:54:05,994
Even your suit is comprised
entirely of energy.

503
00:54:06,413 --> 00:54:07,746
What"s with all the green?

504
00:54:07,914 --> 00:54:09,373
Green is the color of will.

505
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:11,083
The Guardians harnessed will...

506
00:54:11,251 --> 00:54:14,545
...because it"s the strongest
source of energy in the universe.

507
00:54:18,758 --> 00:54:20,426
There"s so many.

508
00:54:20,593 --> 00:54:24,221
The stars you can see from
your home planet on the clearest night...

509
00:54:24,389 --> 00:54:26,432
...your sector is a thousand times Iarger.

510
00:54:27,809 --> 00:54:32,730
And 3600 Lanterns,
each with a sectorjust as vast.

511
00:54:56,713 --> 00:55:00,090
Lanterns, I"ve called you here
to this unprecedented gathering...

512
00:55:00,258 --> 00:55:03,552
...because we face
an unprecedented danger.

513
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:09,558
Our four Lantern brothers
were killed by an enemy called Parallax.

514
00:55:10,727 --> 00:55:14,146
An enemy we don"t yet fully understand.

515
00:55:14,606 --> 00:55:19,276
We do know it"s powerful enough
to destroy entire civilizations.

516
00:55:20,653 --> 00:55:24,615
Powerful enough
to defeat even Abin Sur...

517
00:55:25,075 --> 00:55:27,201
...our finest warrior...

518
00:55:28,661 --> 00:55:30,788
...whose Iight can never be replaced.

519
00:55:36,169 --> 00:55:39,588
The Guardians have charged me
to Iead a squadron of Lanterns...

520
00:55:39,756 --> 00:55:41,507
...in an assault on Parallax.

521
00:55:41,675 --> 00:55:45,386
We will seek out and find this enemy.

522
00:55:46,805 --> 00:55:49,014
And we will destroy it.

523
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:53,519
Alone, we are now vulnerable.

524
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:57,272
United, we are still invincible.

525
00:55:58,024 --> 00:55:59,858
We have never been defeated.

526
00:56:00,276 --> 00:56:02,152
Will we be defeated now?

527
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,487
No!

528
00:56:04,447 --> 00:56:08,992
It was for this moment
that we were created.

529
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:12,287
But I don"t need to tell you your duty.

530
00:56:12,455 --> 00:56:15,457
I don"t need to tell you who we are.

531
00:56:19,045 --> 00:56:22,881
We are the Corps! We are the Corps!

532
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:28,178
We are the Corps! We are the Corps!

533
00:56:31,933 --> 00:56:35,394
Your will turns thought into reality.

534
00:56:35,895 --> 00:56:38,564
To master the ring,
you must Iearn to focus your will...

535
00:56:38,732 --> 00:56:41,775
...and create what you see in your mind.

536
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:47,656
The ring"s Iimits
are only what you can imagine.

537
00:56:52,996 --> 00:56:54,329
Do that again.

538
00:56:54,497 --> 00:56:55,748
Now you try.

539
00:56:58,001 --> 00:56:59,168
Concentrate.

540
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:18,771
The ring will inform you
where there is an imminent threat.

541
00:57:22,192 --> 00:57:25,027
This particular threat"s name is Kilowog.

542
00:57:25,195 --> 00:57:27,696
He"II be your combat training officer.

543
00:57:28,031 --> 00:57:31,617
- Whoa!
- Never Iet your guard down, poozer.

544
00:57:32,452 --> 00:57:34,620
Welcome to Ring Slinging 101.

545
00:57:34,788 --> 00:57:36,372
Or as I Iike to call it:

546
00:57:36,539 --> 00:57:39,416
The worst day of your worthless Iife.

547
00:57:41,961 --> 00:57:44,922
The human. Ain"t never seen one before.

548
00:57:47,509 --> 00:57:49,468
- You smell funny.
- Ugh.

549
00:57:49,969 --> 00:57:51,011
I smell funny?

550
00:57:51,179 --> 00:57:54,973
Yeah, I heard about humans.
Think you"re the center of the universe.

551
00:57:55,141 --> 00:57:56,183
You want to be a Lantern?

552
00:57:56,726 --> 00:57:58,769
You gotta commit to the Corps.

553
00:58:01,439 --> 00:58:03,899
AII right, poozer.
Let"s see what you"ve got.

554
00:58:17,163 --> 00:58:20,666
Your constructs are only gonna be
as strong as your will.

555
00:58:20,834 --> 00:58:22,334
And your will is pathetic.

556
00:58:27,173 --> 00:58:29,383
I"m gonna work you
and I"m gonna hit you...

557
00:58:29,551 --> 00:58:33,012
...until your will is strong enough
to be worthy of the Corps.

558
00:58:46,026 --> 00:58:47,359
Next Iesson.

559
00:58:50,363 --> 00:58:52,531
Ha, ha. Feel that?

560
00:58:52,699 --> 00:58:55,325
It"s the gravitational pull
of your average sun.

561
00:58:55,493 --> 00:58:58,954
Makes flying through space
very dangerous.

562
00:58:59,122 --> 00:59:02,291
The bigger you are,
the quicker you burn.

563
00:59:04,836 --> 00:59:06,879
Gravity"s a bitch.

564
00:59:09,632 --> 00:59:11,842
Here, Iet me help you.

565
00:59:14,554 --> 00:59:19,391
Remember, your enemy,
he"s not gonna play fair.

566
00:59:25,899 --> 00:59:28,859
Well, that"s good advice.
Thanks, gorgeous.

567
00:59:29,027 --> 00:59:30,486
So...

568
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:33,822
...this is the human.

569
00:59:34,574 --> 00:59:37,076
When I Iearned Abin Sur"s ring
had chosen you...

570
00:59:37,243 --> 00:59:38,744
...I said there had to be a mistake.

571
00:59:41,414 --> 00:59:43,874
I see nothing to change my mind.

572
00:59:44,501 --> 00:59:46,210
I"II take it from here, Kilowog.

573
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:50,589
The Corps is only as strong
as its weakest Iink.

574
00:59:51,257 --> 00:59:53,842
And I will tolerate no weak Iinks.

575
00:59:54,344 --> 00:59:55,719
You understand me?

576
00:59:57,555 --> 01:00:00,224
Are you afraid, human?

577
01:00:02,936 --> 01:00:04,186
Are you afraid?

578
01:00:04,354 --> 01:00:05,396
Don"t.

579
01:00:07,524 --> 01:00:09,233
Don"t do that.

580
01:00:13,655 --> 01:00:14,947
Shall we?

581
01:00:17,784 --> 01:00:19,118
Sure.

582
01:00:20,161 --> 01:00:21,870
A sword?

583
01:00:22,038 --> 01:00:23,872
How human.

584
01:00:33,967 --> 01:00:36,510
I do believe I smell fear.

585
01:00:41,725 --> 01:00:43,642
I"m a Green Lantern.

586
01:00:45,729 --> 01:00:47,730
I fear nothing.

587
01:00:49,816 --> 01:00:51,900
Fear is the enemy of will.

588
01:00:52,068 --> 01:00:53,902
Will is what makes you take action.

589
01:00:57,449 --> 01:01:01,076
Fear is what stops you
and makes you weak.

590
01:01:06,916 --> 01:01:08,917
Makes your constructs feeble.

591
01:01:19,179 --> 01:01:22,264
You must ignore your fear.
When you"re afraid, you can"t act.

592
01:01:22,432 --> 01:01:25,976
When you can"t act, you can"t defend.
If you can"t defend, you die.

593
01:01:31,024 --> 01:01:33,025
You reek of fear, Hal Jordan.

594
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:35,277
Abin Sur was a great warrior.

595
01:01:35,737 --> 01:01:37,529
My mentor.

596
01:01:37,822 --> 01:01:39,406
My friend.

597
01:01:39,991 --> 01:01:44,078
You insult his memory
by wearing his ring.

598
01:02:01,888 --> 01:02:05,516
I"m done. He"s right. I"m only human.
We"re not ready to defend the universe.

599
01:02:05,684 --> 01:02:08,727
A few days ago, we thought we were
the only ones in the universe.

600
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:12,564
The ring chose you. It wouldn"t have
if it hadn"t seen something in you.

601
01:02:12,732 --> 01:02:13,774
Oh, yeah?

602
01:02:13,942 --> 01:02:16,151
Something you yourself don"t yet see.

603
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,237
The ring never makes a mistake.

604
01:02:19,364 --> 01:02:20,906
This time it did.

605
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:11,415
--that until recently, we didn"t realize...

606
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:16,462
...that many of these Iittle critters that we"ve
been calling bacteria weren"t bacteria at all.

607
01:03:16,629 --> 01:03:21,467
They were an entirely different type
of primitive prokaryotic cell.

608
01:03:21,634 --> 01:03:25,596
These Iittle buggers, called archaeans,
are still poorly understood.

609
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:29,516
Um....

610
01:03:29,684 --> 01:03:32,728
But might turn out to be
different from bacteria--

611
01:03:36,066 --> 01:03:40,277
But might turn out to be as different
from bacteria as bacteria is from us.

612
01:03:40,445 --> 01:03:41,653
Some call them extremophiles...

613
01:03:43,156 --> 01:03:46,617
...because they Iive in the most extreme
environments on Earth, such as...

614
01:03:46,785 --> 01:03:48,911
God, he"s so boring.

615
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:50,746
...the boiling waters of a geyser.

616
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:52,331
What a Ioser.

617
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:55,125
- Michael!
- Huh?

618
01:03:56,086 --> 01:03:57,127
What did you say?

619
01:03:58,004 --> 01:03:59,171
I didn"t say anything.

620
01:04:02,342 --> 01:04:03,926
Did you just call me a Ioser?

621
01:04:04,094 --> 01:04:06,178
What kind of freak is this guy?

622
01:04:06,346 --> 01:04:07,971
""Freak""?!

623
01:04:26,533 --> 01:04:28,200
Class dismissed.

624
01:05:10,577 --> 01:05:12,411
So how you been?

625
01:05:12,829 --> 01:05:14,580
Been a while.

626
01:05:15,832 --> 01:05:18,917
So you had a rough night Iast night.
Did you get her name, huh?

627
01:05:21,963 --> 01:05:24,465
You need to get some sleep, son.

628
01:05:25,008 --> 01:05:28,010
- Have a seat.
- What can I do for you, Dad?

629
01:05:28,178 --> 01:05:30,596
Well, actually, you"ve already done it.

630
01:05:31,181 --> 01:05:32,931
For me and for your country.

631
01:05:33,433 --> 01:05:34,933
What are you talking about?

632
01:05:35,101 --> 01:05:40,272
I"m talking about you impressing
a whole Iot of very important people.

633
01:05:42,609 --> 01:05:44,234
Where did you get that?

634
01:05:44,402 --> 01:05:47,946
I"m on a subcommittee
overseeing the agencies involved.

635
01:05:48,114 --> 01:05:53,118
- Top-secret, of course.
- It was you. That"s why they chose me.

636
01:05:53,453 --> 01:05:57,373
Because of this, we"re gonna be able
to get you a top post on the inside now...

637
01:05:57,540 --> 01:05:59,208
...helping to oversee the operation.

638
01:05:59,376 --> 01:06:03,962
There are scientists
that worked their whole Iives for this.

639
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:06,131
- Mm-hm.
- People more qualified.

640
01:06:06,299 --> 01:06:07,591
And Iess connected.

641
01:06:07,759 --> 01:06:11,387
Don"t be naive, son.
It"s the way the world works.

642
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:15,057
You have to seize an opportunity
when it presents itself.

643
01:06:17,811 --> 01:06:19,603
He"II never get it.

644
01:06:19,771 --> 01:06:20,813
Just wasting his Iife away.

645
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:23,649
What an embarrassment.

646
01:06:25,485 --> 01:06:28,821
Bill! Ha. How are you?

647
01:06:28,988 --> 01:06:30,656
I"m terrific.

648
01:06:30,824 --> 01:06:34,743
No, no, no. Just finishing up a meeting.
Got plenty of time.

649
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:38,307
With my own eyes I saw this
creature induce fear in our finest warriors...

650
01:07:38,475 --> 01:07:40,601
...and then feed on that fear.

651
01:07:41,394 --> 01:07:42,811
There"s more.

652
01:07:42,979 --> 01:07:46,982
We"ve tracked its trajectory.
Parallax is headed for Oa.

653
01:07:47,484 --> 01:07:49,818
Never before has an enemy
dared attack us here.

654
01:07:49,986 --> 01:07:52,237
You must tell me what you know.

655
01:07:54,741 --> 01:07:57,159
Will has always been our sole weapon...

656
01:07:57,327 --> 01:08:00,037
...against the forces of darkness
in the universe.

657
01:08:00,538 --> 01:08:04,083
But as that power began to seem
insufficient...

658
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:06,752
...a great debate arose among us.

659
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,338
Should we exploit
another source of power...

660
01:08:09,673 --> 01:08:13,676
...one we had Iong since sworn
should never be used?

661
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:15,761
Fear.

662
01:08:15,929 --> 01:08:19,598
But the power of fear
was too unpredictable.

663
01:08:19,766 --> 01:08:22,434
The chance of corruption too great.

664
01:08:22,602 --> 01:08:25,020
And so we decided against it.

665
01:08:25,188 --> 01:08:29,191
AII of us, that is, except one.

666
01:08:29,901 --> 01:08:33,654
Alone, this Guardian
entered the forbidden chamber.

667
01:08:33,822 --> 01:08:37,783
He wanted to prove the Iight of fear
could be mastered.

668
01:08:37,951 --> 01:08:40,786
His intentions were pure...

669
01:08:40,954 --> 01:08:44,039
...but his hopes were naive.

670
01:08:44,874 --> 01:08:47,751
Consumed by the yellow power of fear...

671
01:08:47,919 --> 01:08:52,464
...the Guardian became the very evil
he had wished to destroy.

672
01:08:52,632 --> 01:08:54,717
He became Parallax.

673
01:09:02,308 --> 01:09:05,227
For the universe"s safety and his own...

674
01:09:05,395 --> 01:09:09,648
...Abin Sur was charged with
imprisoning Parallax in the Lost Sector.

675
01:09:09,816 --> 01:09:11,191
But he escaped.

676
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:15,320
Feeding on the fear of others,
he grew Iarger, more powerful.

677
01:09:15,488 --> 01:09:16,655
And is now headed here...

678
01:09:16,823 --> 01:09:20,159
...to take his revenge on you
and destroy the Corps.

679
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,168
Then we have no choice.

680
01:09:29,836 --> 01:09:33,589
We must prepare to harness the power
of our enemy and fight fear with fear.

681
01:09:33,757 --> 01:09:36,925
To protect our sectors,
we must be able to defend ourselves.

682
01:09:38,136 --> 01:09:40,888
We must forge a yellow ring.

683
01:09:49,689 --> 01:09:50,689
Watch your step.

684
01:09:50,857 --> 01:09:52,524
- Senator.
- Senator.

685
01:09:52,692 --> 01:09:55,611
Don"t have to worry about me no more

686
01:09:55,779 --> 01:09:58,989
I"m gone

687
01:09:59,741 --> 01:10:03,786
I"m gone, I"m gone

688
01:10:06,331 --> 01:10:07,373
Hello.

689
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:08,791
Hi.

690
01:10:13,713 --> 01:10:16,340
Everybody get on your feet

691
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:19,802
You make me nervous
When you"re in your seat

692
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:22,054
Rough night, huh?

693
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:25,140
Hector.

694
01:10:26,226 --> 01:10:28,060
How you doing?
What have you been up to?

695
01:10:28,228 --> 01:10:30,854
- Same old, same old.
- Yeah. Me too.

696
01:10:31,022 --> 01:10:35,901
Hal Jordan. Worst pilot I"ve ever seen.
Or the best. Not quite sure.

697
01:10:36,069 --> 01:10:37,236
I"ve been called both.

698
01:10:37,404 --> 01:10:40,906
- Glad you could make it, son.
- I was a Iittle surprised I got the invite.

699
01:10:41,074 --> 01:10:42,241
No, you"re family, Hal.

700
01:10:42,409 --> 01:10:45,119
There are thinkers in this world
and there are doers.

701
01:10:45,286 --> 01:10:47,079
And you are one of the doers.

702
01:10:48,873 --> 01:10:51,375
Yeah, but the thinkers
make what I do possible.

703
01:10:51,543 --> 01:10:53,919
Wouldn"t have a plane
unless someone thought it up.

704
01:10:54,087 --> 01:10:55,462
Of course.

705
01:10:55,672 --> 01:10:57,589
Excuse me, I need a drink.

706
01:10:59,259 --> 01:11:02,094
- I gotta get back to work. This is work.
- Yes, sir.

707
01:11:02,262 --> 01:11:04,930
- Nice to see you, son.
- You too. You too.

708
01:11:11,563 --> 01:11:13,397
Nice.

709
01:11:15,275 --> 01:11:18,152
Yeah, my dad used to train in it.

710
01:11:19,112 --> 01:11:21,864
I was talking about your dress.

711
01:11:24,284 --> 01:11:26,076
Nice jacket.

712
01:11:26,244 --> 01:11:28,412
Last time I checked,
you didn"t even own one.

713
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:31,290
Yeah, I"ve been shaking up
the wardrobe Iately.

714
01:11:31,458 --> 01:11:34,960
Congratulations on the contract.
How"d you manage to pull that off?

715
01:11:35,128 --> 01:11:38,464
I pointed out you only won because you
broke the rules of engagement.

716
01:11:38,673 --> 01:11:41,800
And Tom figured out
how to give the Sabres more altitude.

717
01:11:41,968 --> 01:11:45,262
So I guess in a way,
without even meaning to...

718
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:47,139
...you actually did us a favor.

719
01:11:48,933 --> 01:11:50,309
Look...

720
01:11:51,478 --> 01:11:53,520
...I"m uncomfortable
with the word ""hero.""

721
01:11:53,688 --> 01:11:55,314
Hey

722
01:12:02,197 --> 01:12:04,490
Thank you. Thank you all forjoining us.

723
01:12:04,657 --> 01:12:05,824
Great evening.

724
01:12:05,992 --> 01:12:10,245
Somebody very special I"d Iike to thank
for helping us to nail this contract:

725
01:12:10,955 --> 01:12:13,332
My daughter, Carol Ferris.

726
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:14,500
Come on!

727
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:26,053
Congratulations, Carol.

728
01:12:26,221 --> 01:12:28,305
I take one Iook at you, young Iady...

729
01:12:28,473 --> 01:12:30,849
...or at Hal Jordan over there,
spitting image of his dad...

730
01:12:31,017 --> 01:12:33,018
- Whoo!
- You give us hope.

731
01:12:33,436 --> 01:12:35,187
A toast to our future.

732
01:12:35,355 --> 01:12:37,189
- Hear, hear!
- To the future!

733
01:12:37,357 --> 01:12:38,440
We"re in good hands.

734
01:12:54,916 --> 01:12:57,710
Hector! Oh, my God! Hey!

735
01:13:03,008 --> 01:13:05,551
- Congratulations. Um...
- Thank you.

736
01:13:05,719 --> 01:13:09,304
Here"s to you and Hal, the future.

737
01:13:10,056 --> 01:13:13,350
Yeah, heh, I"m sorry.

738
01:13:13,768 --> 01:13:17,479
I know it couldn"t have been easy
growing up with your dad.

739
01:13:17,647 --> 01:13:20,649
But, hey, you"re doing great, so-- Ha, ha.

740
01:13:20,817 --> 01:13:22,568
I am. I"m doing great. Ha, ha.

741
01:13:22,736 --> 01:13:25,404
- He"s right, though. I"m not a doer.
- Ha, ha.

742
01:13:25,572 --> 01:13:28,240
Although I did get to examine
an alien body recently.

743
01:13:28,408 --> 01:13:29,950
That was very cool.

744
01:13:30,118 --> 01:13:33,704
I can"t tell anyone about it,
but, hey, you can"t have everything.

745
01:13:33,872 --> 01:13:36,123
Hector telling you another
of his science-fiction stories?

746
01:13:36,291 --> 01:13:38,292
What the hell"s wrong with him?

747
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:40,252
Can"t keep his mouth shut.

748
01:13:40,837 --> 01:13:43,255
You really do have
a creative imagination.

749
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:44,757
Bye.

750
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:46,091
Senator.

751
01:13:46,593 --> 01:13:49,261
I apologize. We really must go.

752
01:13:50,263 --> 01:13:52,348
- Good night, Carol.
- Good night.

753
01:13:55,935 --> 01:13:56,935
Senator!

754
01:13:57,270 --> 01:13:58,812
Hey.

755
01:13:59,647 --> 01:14:00,773
Thanks for everything.

756
01:14:11,284 --> 01:14:13,077
Bye, senator!

757
01:14:38,937 --> 01:14:42,314
Get the crash crew here.
Our helicopter"s going down.

758
01:14:52,617 --> 01:14:53,742
Oh, my God.

759
01:16:01,853 --> 01:16:04,313
What is that? What is that?

760
01:17:27,814 --> 01:17:30,816
What happened tonight took place
in just a matter of seconds...

761
01:17:30,984 --> 01:17:33,652
...but people will be talking about it
for years to come.

762
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:37,740
A helicopter careening out of control,
headed toward certain tragedy...

763
01:17:37,907 --> 01:17:42,077
...when all of a sudden, a mystery man,
a hero, saves the day...

764
01:17:42,245 --> 01:17:45,831
...incredibly diverting the helicopter
from destroying innocent people...

765
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:50,336
...and miraculously rescuing Carol Ferris.

766
01:17:50,795 --> 01:17:56,008
The real question tonight is who is this
amazing hero and where is he now?

767
01:18:06,353 --> 01:18:08,395
Start talking.

768
01:18:09,564 --> 01:18:11,023
- A racetrack?
- Yeah.

769
01:18:11,191 --> 01:18:12,608
Hmm.

770
01:18:12,776 --> 01:18:16,195
That"s the best you could come up with
for your first big appearance? Racetrack.

771
01:18:16,363 --> 01:18:18,530
Oh, I"m sorry. Did I disappoint you?

772
01:18:18,698 --> 01:18:23,327
I materialized a track out of pure energy,
saving hundreds, and you"re disappointed.

773
01:18:23,495 --> 01:18:24,620
I"m sorry about that.

774
01:18:24,788 --> 01:18:26,497
No, I wanna see this stuff. Show me.

775
01:18:26,664 --> 01:18:28,207
I don"t think that"s a good idea.

776
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:29,917
Come on, I wanna see this stuff.

777
01:18:30,085 --> 01:18:32,711
I wanna see the outfit, the flying--
You gotta show me.

778
01:18:32,879 --> 01:18:34,755
Hal, being your best friend"s no picnic.

779
01:18:34,923 --> 01:18:37,174
- It"s for emergencies!
- You owe me!

780
01:18:37,967 --> 01:18:40,636
Hal, I wanna see it.

781
01:18:41,846 --> 01:18:42,888
Fine.

782
01:18:44,224 --> 01:18:45,683
Hold on to your glasses.

783
01:18:48,395 --> 01:18:49,645
AII right.

784
01:18:49,813 --> 01:18:51,313
Question:

785
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:55,150
- You ready to have your mind blown?
- Yeah.

786
01:18:56,069 --> 01:18:57,277
Ring.

787
01:18:57,445 --> 01:18:59,029
Finger.

788
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:10,708
Here we go.

789
01:19:18,258 --> 01:19:21,468
- Did you break it already?
- I didn"t break it, okay? It"s just....

790
01:19:21,636 --> 01:19:24,388
It"s out ofjuice. I have to recharge it.

791
01:19:34,649 --> 01:19:36,483
Now pay attention.

792
01:19:39,779 --> 01:19:41,447
Aah! Green!

793
01:19:44,117 --> 01:19:46,618
- Wow.
- I know, right?!

794
01:19:49,456 --> 01:19:50,956
Whoo!

795
01:19:54,085 --> 01:19:55,252
Not bad, huh?

796
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:57,588
You"re a superhero.

797
01:20:05,889 --> 01:20:07,806
Don"t they always get the girl?

798
01:20:36,795 --> 01:20:38,420
Evening, ma"am.

799
01:20:39,089 --> 01:20:41,715
Didn"t get a chance to say goodbye.

800
01:20:42,342 --> 01:20:44,051
Are you okay?

801
01:20:44,219 --> 01:20:47,680
Uh, yeah, no,
I"m glad to have a chance to thank you.

802
01:20:47,847 --> 01:20:50,599
Just doing my job.
No thanks necessary, miss.

803
01:20:51,017 --> 01:20:52,851
No, it is.

804
01:20:53,603 --> 01:20:55,479
You saved my Iife.

805
01:20:55,855 --> 01:20:59,024
You saved all of our Iives.
That was a very....

806
01:21:06,282 --> 01:21:07,449
Hal?

807
01:21:07,867 --> 01:21:09,034
Miss?

808
01:21:09,202 --> 01:21:10,619
Hal?!

809
01:21:11,371 --> 01:21:14,039
Oh, my Go-- Oh, my God!

810
01:21:14,249 --> 01:21:16,875
- Oh, my God! Hal!
- How did you know it was me?

811
01:21:17,043 --> 01:21:19,795
What? I"ve known you my whole Iife!
I"ve seen you naked!

812
01:21:19,963 --> 01:21:22,881
You don"t think I would recognize you
because I can"t see your cheekbones?!

813
01:21:23,049 --> 01:21:26,802
What is this?! Why is your skin green?
Why are you glowing?

814
01:21:26,970 --> 01:21:28,679
What the hell is with that mask?!

815
01:21:29,264 --> 01:21:30,389
It came with the outfit.

816
01:21:32,726 --> 01:21:34,018
Cool, huh?

817
01:21:35,353 --> 01:21:38,564
So it all works
because of this magic ring? Ha, ha.

818
01:21:38,732 --> 01:21:41,400
No, there"s no such thing as magic.

819
01:21:41,568 --> 01:21:44,194
Intergalactic green peacekeepers,
thousands of them.

820
01:21:44,362 --> 01:21:46,655
- Ha, ha.
- But, no.

821
01:21:46,906 --> 01:21:48,032
I"m not making it up.

822
01:21:50,577 --> 01:21:53,037
I mean, when we were kids,
who"d have thought?

823
01:21:53,663 --> 01:21:57,166
- I did, actually. I called this early on.
- Ha-ha-ha.

824
01:21:57,334 --> 01:22:01,378
I said, ""One day I"II be a green space cop.""
Here I am.

825
01:22:03,173 --> 01:22:06,592
Okay, so at the party, how did you
make that big green ramp thing?

826
01:22:07,344 --> 01:22:10,679
Anything I see in my mind, I can create.
I just have to focus.

827
01:22:11,348 --> 01:22:12,431
Anything?

828
01:22:13,433 --> 01:22:14,683
Anything.

829
01:22:29,908 --> 01:22:33,035
Happy birthday. Better Iate than never.

830
01:22:34,245 --> 01:22:35,287
Um....

831
01:22:36,289 --> 01:22:37,956
Okay, so how does it work?

832
01:22:38,124 --> 01:22:43,420
They just, um, call you on your cell,
""Cat in a tree, downtown Milky Way""?

833
01:22:43,588 --> 01:22:46,632
No. I don"t think it works
exactly Iike that.

834
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,385
Well, technically speaking, um...

835
01:22:49,636 --> 01:22:51,804
...I actually sort of, uh...

836
01:22:52,847 --> 01:22:54,098
...quit.

837
01:22:54,265 --> 01:22:55,474
What do you mean? How?

838
01:22:55,642 --> 01:22:59,144
Well, I mean, it"s a Iot Iike quitting
anything else, really.

839
01:22:59,771 --> 01:23:00,979
I don"t understand.

840
01:23:01,147 --> 01:23:03,440
How do you walk away
from something Iike that?

841
01:23:03,608 --> 01:23:04,817
Is that even possible?

842
01:23:04,984 --> 01:23:08,445
Oh, I think we both know
I"m pretty good at walking away.

843
01:23:13,368 --> 01:23:16,829
If for once you didn"t quit something
you cared about...

844
01:23:16,996 --> 01:23:19,248
...what"s the worst that could happen?

845
01:23:36,641 --> 01:23:38,851
Well, thank you.
This has been really something.

846
01:23:39,019 --> 01:23:42,396
- I know I"ve made a Iot of mistakes--
- Look, Hal, I"m not mad at you.

847
01:23:43,314 --> 01:23:45,524
I feel bad for you, really.

848
01:23:45,859 --> 01:23:48,694
You"ve been given so much so often.

849
01:23:49,529 --> 01:23:51,030
And you just...

850
01:23:55,368 --> 01:23:56,243
Good night.

851
01:24:49,464 --> 01:24:50,506
Dr. Hammond?

852
01:24:52,842 --> 01:24:55,719
There is something I"d Iike to show you.

853
01:24:55,887 --> 01:24:59,306
Something I"m fairly certain
you"II want to see.

854
01:25:07,607 --> 01:25:08,899
See you Iater, Mom.

855
01:25:09,067 --> 01:25:10,734
- I Iove you.
- Bye, baby.

856
01:25:12,487 --> 01:25:14,363
No!

857
01:25:17,450 --> 01:25:21,787
Physical contact
accesses mnemonic data.

858
01:25:22,455 --> 01:25:25,207
I can see your memories.

859
01:26:01,619 --> 01:26:02,661
Dad.

860
01:26:04,330 --> 01:26:06,665
Son, this is my fault.

861
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,251
But I"m gonna fix it.

862
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:13,630
We"re gonna get you well again.
Whatever it takes.

863
01:26:15,425 --> 01:26:18,177
I don"t know what you"re talking about.

864
01:26:18,345 --> 01:26:20,763
We detected traces
of a second alien Iife form...

865
01:26:20,930 --> 01:26:23,015
...buried within the body of the first.

866
01:26:23,183 --> 01:26:25,517
You"ve been exposed.

867
01:26:25,852 --> 01:26:30,814
I"ve never felt better in my Iife.

868
01:26:31,566 --> 01:26:33,942
We know everything, son.

869
01:26:34,694 --> 01:26:37,029
I"ve never felt better in my Iife.

870
01:26:57,384 --> 01:27:01,136
To be chosen to join its ranks
is the highest of honors...

871
01:27:01,304 --> 01:27:03,847
...and the greatest of responsibilities.

872
01:27:04,057 --> 01:27:06,558
The ring never makes a mistake.

873
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:33,252
It"s gonna be all right.

874
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:35,838
They just need to run some tests,
that"s all.

875
01:27:41,177 --> 01:27:42,678
Keep him under.

876
01:27:45,932 --> 01:27:48,058
I only want what"s best for you.

877
01:28:06,786 --> 01:28:08,037
Run.

878
01:28:43,114 --> 01:28:44,948
- Hector.
- Shh, shh.

879
01:28:45,116 --> 01:28:46,658
Don"t worry.

880
01:28:48,495 --> 01:28:50,496
I only want what"s best for you.

881
01:30:12,662 --> 01:30:15,164
The ring, it chose you.

882
01:30:15,331 --> 01:30:16,874
Take it!

883
01:30:18,668 --> 01:30:20,002
Hal.

884
01:30:20,879 --> 01:30:22,671
Hi.

885
01:30:25,592 --> 01:30:28,427
The alien was one of you.

886
01:30:30,388 --> 01:30:32,931
How did we end up so different?

887
01:30:33,099 --> 01:30:34,850
Hmm? Hmm?

888
01:30:35,018 --> 01:30:36,643
Sit down!

889
01:30:38,938 --> 01:30:40,189
Now...

890
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:43,609
...how"s Carol?

891
01:30:45,779 --> 01:30:47,237
- That came out wrong.
- Please.

892
01:30:47,405 --> 01:30:49,281
- I"ve made mistakes--
- Look, Hal--

893
01:30:49,449 --> 01:30:51,909
I feel bad for you, really. Good night.

894
01:30:57,749 --> 01:31:02,002
You"re just as much of a failure
as I was.

895
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:04,963
And just as afraid.

896
01:31:06,174 --> 01:31:08,592
Well...

897
01:31:09,302 --> 01:31:11,553
...I used to fight my fear.

898
01:31:15,308 --> 01:31:19,478
But now that I"ve tasted its true power...

899
01:31:23,066 --> 01:31:25,150
...I"II never go back.

900
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:35,619
No!

901
01:31:55,306 --> 01:31:58,934
You wear the ring of the Lantern
that imprisoned me.

902
01:31:59,853 --> 01:32:02,312
You will suffer the same fate.

903
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:05,816
Once I have devoured your world...

904
01:32:05,984 --> 01:32:08,318
...I will have all the strength I need...

905
01:32:08,486 --> 01:32:12,364
...to defeat the Corps
and destroy the Guardians.

906
01:32:44,731 --> 01:32:46,065
Let me get this straight.

907
01:32:46,232 --> 01:32:49,610
This thing that"s out there attacking planets
is connected to Hector?

908
01:32:49,778 --> 01:32:52,363
Somehow it infected him
after it killed Abin Sur.

909
01:32:52,530 --> 01:32:56,742
- Well, you"re just gonna have to stop it.
- Oh, I"m just gonna have to stop it, huh?

910
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:58,577
Well, I tried that and I failed.

911
01:32:58,745 --> 01:33:02,081
And the senator died.
I told you, the ring made a mistake.

912
01:33:02,248 --> 01:33:04,917
Wait, go back.
How did the ring make a mistake?

913
01:33:05,085 --> 01:33:10,047
The one thing that a Green Lantern
is supposed to be is fearless.

914
01:33:10,590 --> 01:33:13,717
Fearless is the job description.

915
01:33:14,344 --> 01:33:15,386
That isn"t me.

916
01:33:15,553 --> 01:33:17,930
So you"re just gonna walk away again?

917
01:33:18,098 --> 01:33:22,017
Explain this to me, Hal.
Please explain to me just once, why.

918
01:33:22,185 --> 01:33:23,936
Because I"m afraid!

919
01:33:40,745 --> 01:33:42,788
You don"t think your dad ever felt afraid?

920
01:33:44,082 --> 01:33:45,916
If he did,
he figured out some way to beat it.

921
01:33:46,084 --> 01:33:48,794
Yeah, well, there"s a word for that:

922
01:33:49,129 --> 01:33:50,671
Courage.

923
01:33:57,595 --> 01:34:01,306
They said that the ring wouldn"t have
chosen me if it didn"t see something.

924
01:34:02,308 --> 01:34:05,602
Something I don"t see. Yet.

925
01:34:09,315 --> 01:34:10,691
I see it.

926
01:34:12,027 --> 01:34:13,986
I always have.

927
01:34:14,904 --> 01:34:17,322
The ring didn"t see
that you were fearless.

928
01:34:17,490 --> 01:34:20,826
It saw that you had the ability
to overcome fear.

929
01:34:21,578 --> 01:34:23,996
It saw that you"re courageous.

930
01:34:27,167 --> 01:34:28,500
Which you are.

931
01:34:29,336 --> 01:34:30,669
Just Iike your dad.

932
01:34:39,346 --> 01:34:42,056
The Lantern is a threat.

933
01:34:42,932 --> 01:34:45,225
Eliminate him.

934
01:35:19,219 --> 01:35:21,345
Our new weapon is ready.

935
01:35:22,055 --> 01:35:23,722
Once I"ve mastered its power...

936
01:35:24,391 --> 01:35:27,059
...I"II begin training the Corps
to do the same.

937
01:35:28,395 --> 01:35:30,562
Though Earth will be Iost...

938
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:35,067
...we"II be ready to make a stand against
Parallax before it reaches Oa.

939
01:35:35,235 --> 01:35:36,819
Then the power of the enemy
will be ours.

940
01:35:36,986 --> 01:35:38,821
At what cost?

941
01:35:41,574 --> 01:35:44,243
- You dare enter this chamber?
- I need your help.

942
01:35:45,870 --> 01:35:48,080
You gotta help me save my world.

943
01:35:55,922 --> 01:36:01,093
I know that humans aren"t
the strongest species, or the smartest.

944
01:36:02,512 --> 01:36:04,596
We"re young, we have a Iot to Iearn.

945
01:36:05,306 --> 01:36:06,598
But we"re worth saving.

946
01:36:15,316 --> 01:36:17,609
This new weapon of yours,
you can"t use it.

947
01:36:17,819 --> 01:36:21,613
Once you cross that Iine, once you"ve given
in to fear, you"II never go back. I"ve seen it.

948
01:36:23,742 --> 01:36:26,577
Look, I know right now you"re afraid.

949
01:36:26,745 --> 01:36:29,079
You dare accuse the Guardians
of feeling fear?

950
01:36:29,247 --> 01:36:30,539
Yes, I do.

951
01:36:30,707 --> 01:36:32,875
That"s exactly why Parallax
is beating you...

952
01:36:33,043 --> 01:36:35,627
...because you"re afraid
to even admit you"re afraid.

953
01:36:35,795 --> 01:36:37,379
I know.

954
01:36:37,797 --> 01:36:39,757
I spent my entire Iife doing it.

955
01:36:40,967 --> 01:36:43,552
You know, we have a saying on Earth.

956
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:46,263
We say, ""I"m only human.""

957
01:36:47,974 --> 01:36:51,602
We say it because we"re vulnerable,
we say it because we know we"re afraid.

958
01:36:51,770 --> 01:36:53,896
It doesn"t mean we"re weak.

959
01:36:56,149 --> 01:36:57,608
Help me save my planet.

960
01:36:58,651 --> 01:37:00,069
Don"t give in to fear.

961
01:37:00,236 --> 01:37:03,364
Fight it. Fight it with me.

962
01:37:04,616 --> 01:37:06,992
Your words are compelling, young human.

963
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:10,829
But as immortals, we must measure
our actions over billions of years...

964
01:37:10,997 --> 01:37:13,165
...and the fate of the universe.

965
01:37:13,333 --> 01:37:17,836
We simply cannot risk Iosing everything
on the chance you might be right.

966
01:37:18,004 --> 01:37:21,131
Then don"t. Don"t risk any more Iives.

967
01:37:22,342 --> 01:37:23,467
Just mine.

968
01:37:25,261 --> 01:37:27,012
Let me go fight for my world...

969
01:37:27,180 --> 01:37:31,392
...and I"II show you
that will is stronger than fear.

970
01:37:32,352 --> 01:37:34,520
There is no way you can succeed.

971
01:37:34,688 --> 01:37:36,897
You will die, Hal Jordan.

972
01:37:38,525 --> 01:37:40,776
Then I"II die trying.

973
01:37:43,363 --> 01:37:45,531
Good Iuck, Green Lantern.

974
01:38:44,883 --> 01:38:46,425
I wouldn"t do that.

975
01:38:49,429 --> 01:38:50,763
Look closely.

976
01:38:55,727 --> 01:38:57,519
She"s beautiful, isn"t she?

977
01:38:58,772 --> 01:39:01,607
I Ioved her from the moment
I first saw her.

978
01:39:01,775 --> 01:39:04,943
But she could never see me,
as you were always standing in the way.

979
01:39:05,111 --> 01:39:06,945
But not anymore.

980
01:39:07,572 --> 01:39:10,074
No! No! Don"t! Don"t do this, Hector.

981
01:39:10,241 --> 01:39:13,786
Please.

982
01:39:14,871 --> 01:39:15,913
I know how you feel.

983
01:39:17,957 --> 01:39:19,958
Come on, Iook at yourself!

984
01:39:22,629 --> 01:39:24,797
No, I know what it"s Iike...

985
01:39:26,132 --> 01:39:27,966
...to not Iive up to expectations...

986
01:39:28,134 --> 01:39:31,387
...to feel Iike nothing that you do
will ever be good enough.

987
01:39:35,642 --> 01:39:37,976
I know what it"s Iike to be afraid.

988
01:39:39,104 --> 01:39:40,896
Let me help you.

989
01:39:42,273 --> 01:39:45,150
Hal. You"ve changed.

990
01:39:46,403 --> 01:39:49,905
How wonderful that all it took for you
to grow up was the end of the world.

991
01:39:51,408 --> 01:39:53,117
Now it"s my turn.

992
01:39:55,286 --> 01:39:58,455
And if I can"t be Iike you,
I"m gonna make her Iike me.

993
01:39:58,623 --> 01:40:00,791
And Iet"s face it, once she"s Iike me...

994
01:40:01,584 --> 01:40:03,752
...then you wouldn"t be very interested.

995
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:06,005
Hmm? Now, would you?

996
01:40:07,841 --> 01:40:09,967
- Why can"t you?
- Hmm?

997
01:40:11,344 --> 01:40:13,137
Why can"t you be Iike me?

998
01:40:13,304 --> 01:40:15,347
Heh. Huh?

999
01:40:16,599 --> 01:40:17,975
Let her go...

1000
01:40:21,354 --> 01:40:22,479
...and you can have it.

1001
01:40:28,194 --> 01:40:30,029
You can do anything.

1002
01:40:30,697 --> 01:40:32,364
Be anything.

1003
01:40:35,035 --> 01:40:36,452
Take it.

1004
01:40:39,748 --> 01:40:41,999
Let her make the choice.

1005
01:40:47,505 --> 01:40:48,964
Okay.

1006
01:41:16,576 --> 01:41:17,910
Wow.

1007
01:41:28,546 --> 01:41:29,922
Now bring her down.

1008
01:41:33,593 --> 01:41:34,760
Hal.

1009
01:41:36,554 --> 01:41:37,596
I Iied.

1010
01:41:43,687 --> 01:41:45,229
I Iied too.

1011
01:41:45,939 --> 01:41:47,940
See, the way it works is...

1012
01:41:48,108 --> 01:41:49,358
...you have to be chosen.

1013
01:42:30,108 --> 01:42:32,067
You have failed me.

1014
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:04,850
Stay here.

1015
01:43:05,018 --> 01:43:06,352
No problem.

1016
01:43:33,963 --> 01:43:36,965
Your will is strong,
but not strong enough.

1017
01:43:38,051 --> 01:43:40,886
You are nothing without the ring.

1018
01:44:06,746 --> 01:44:09,248
You must move out of the area now.

1019
01:44:09,416 --> 01:44:11,917
Please clear the streets.

1020
01:44:12,085 --> 01:44:13,877
Clear the streets immediately.

1021
01:44:17,340 --> 01:44:19,591
You can never beat this. You"II die.

1022
01:44:19,759 --> 01:44:21,593
At Ieast I can get it away from here.

1023
01:44:21,761 --> 01:44:24,430
- How do you think you"re gonna do that?
- I don"t know. I don"t know.

1024
01:44:25,849 --> 01:44:28,267
Maybe I can outthink it or. ...

1025
01:44:28,435 --> 01:44:30,269
The dogfight, remember?

1026
01:44:30,437 --> 01:44:31,937
Those were a couple ofjets.

1027
01:44:32,105 --> 01:44:34,231
Unbeatable jets.

1028
01:44:36,526 --> 01:44:39,111
The ring chose me for a reason.

1029
01:44:40,363 --> 01:44:42,156
This is why.

1030
01:44:43,742 --> 01:44:46,618
- Look, I"m probably not--
- Please don"t. No.

1031
01:44:46,786 --> 01:44:48,162
Hey.

1032
01:44:57,213 --> 01:44:59,465
This is a mandatory evacuation.

1033
01:44:59,632 --> 01:45:01,967
Everyone must clear the streets
immediately.

1034
01:45:03,553 --> 01:45:07,639
Police emergency,
everyone must clear the street now.

1035
01:45:42,926 --> 01:45:45,344
Everybody off now! Now!

1036
01:45:45,887 --> 01:45:47,137
Go! Go!

1037
01:45:56,481 --> 01:45:57,815
Run!

1038
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:25,968
- Run!
- Aah! Aah!

1039
01:46:44,696 --> 01:46:47,406
I feel your fear growing.

1040
01:46:47,824 --> 01:46:49,616
You will be dead soon.

1041
01:46:49,784 --> 01:46:52,578
In brightest day, in blackest night--

1042
01:46:52,746 --> 01:46:56,248
And when you"re gone,
I"II destroy everything you ever Ioved.

1043
01:46:56,416 --> 01:46:59,418
--no evil shall escape my sight.

1044
01:46:59,586 --> 01:47:03,047
Your family, your home,
your planet will be no more.

1045
01:47:03,465 --> 01:47:07,343
Let those who worship evil"s might--

1046
01:47:07,510 --> 01:47:12,139
The entire human race will be wiped out
because you, Hal Jordan...

1047
01:47:12,307 --> 01:47:13,849
...were afraid.

1048
01:47:14,017 --> 01:47:16,560
--beware my power:

1049
01:47:17,103 --> 01:47:18,437
Green Lantern"s Iight!

1050
01:48:34,431 --> 01:48:38,350
The bigger you are, the faster you burn.

1051
01:50:39,973 --> 01:50:42,433
Though his time
wearing the ring has been brief...

1052
01:50:43,518 --> 01:50:48,814
...Hal Jordan"s defeat of Parallax will be
remembered as Iong as the Corps exists.

1053
01:50:49,024 --> 01:50:52,651
His actions are a reminder
of why the ring chose each of us.

1054
01:50:53,820 --> 01:50:55,654
To overcome fear...

1055
01:50:56,322 --> 01:50:59,658
...and destroy evil wherever it may hide.

1056
01:51:08,209 --> 01:51:10,461
As Lanterns,
we must fight with all our will.

1057
01:51:12,213 --> 01:51:14,673
Our wills haven"t always been united.

1058
01:51:16,509 --> 01:51:17,760
It"s time they were.

1059
01:51:19,804 --> 01:51:22,431
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Can I train them or can I train them?

1060
01:51:23,683 --> 01:51:26,060
You"re impertinent, Hal Jordan.

1061
01:51:26,227 --> 01:51:29,855
You"re rash, volatile, opinionated.

1062
01:51:31,358 --> 01:51:34,610
It seems Abin Sur found another
just Iike himself.

1063
01:52:16,569 --> 01:52:19,488
Wow, I am never getting used to that.

1064
01:52:24,077 --> 01:52:27,579
My newjob requires that I travel.

1065
01:52:30,417 --> 01:52:31,834
Be away for a while.

1066
01:52:35,672 --> 01:52:39,425
Away, never gone.

1067
01:52:44,180 --> 01:52:45,389
Hal.

1068
01:52:45,557 --> 01:52:46,890
Yeah?

1069
01:52:47,267 --> 01:52:49,435
Can you take off the mask?

1070
01:52:54,607 --> 01:52:55,941
That"s really cool. Ha, ha.

1071
01:53:10,623 --> 01:53:12,458
So, what happens now?

1072
01:53:13,710 --> 01:53:15,627
I"m gonna go Iook for trouble.

1073
01:53:39,152 --> 01:53:41,570
Of all the Lanterns
who have ever worn the ring...

1074
01:53:41,738 --> 01:53:44,740
...there was one
whose Iight shined brightest.

1075
01:53:45,158 --> 01:53:48,494
At first, his humanity
was thought to be a weakness.

1076
01:53:48,661 --> 01:53:52,581
And yet it proved to be
his greatest strength.
