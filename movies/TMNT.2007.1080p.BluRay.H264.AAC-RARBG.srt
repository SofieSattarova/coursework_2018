1
00:01:05,256 --> 00:01:06,591
<i>Four turtles...</i>

2
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:09,928
<i>...four brothers...</i>

3
00:01:12,555 --> 00:01:16,393
<i>...genetically reborn
in the sewers of New York.</i>

4
00:01:17,853 --> 00:01:21,857
<i>Named after the great
Renaissance masters...</i>

5
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:24,818
<i>...and trained as ninjas.</i>

6
00:01:30,282 --> 00:01:34,787
<i>They battled many creatures and foes
before defeating their archenemy...</i>

7
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:37,289
<i>...the Shredder.</i>

8
00:01:41,084 --> 00:01:46,215
<i>But now a greater evil is poised
to destroy their very brotherhood.</i>

9
00:01:46,382 --> 00:01:51,429
<i>An evil born 3000 years ago.</i>

10
00:01:59,394 --> 00:02:02,732
<i>It was in that time
that a warrior king named Yoatl...</i>

11
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:07,903
<i>...led a brotherhood that fought
side by side with one purpose:</i>

12
00:02:09,613 --> 00:02:13,743
<i>To conquer all the kingdoms
of the world.</i>

13
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:20,624
<i>Nothing could stand in their way...</i>

14
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:25,338
<i>...as they left a trail of destruction
behind them.</i>

15
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,941
<i>In his quest,
the warrior learned of a constellation...</i>

16
00:02:45,108 --> 00:02:47,610
<i>...known as the Stars of Kikan.</i>

17
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:51,656
<i>Every 3000 years,
the stars would align...</i>

18
00:02:51,822 --> 00:02:56,577
<i>...opening a portal
to a world of unknown power.</i>

19
00:03:01,082 --> 00:03:02,708
<i>He became immortal...</i>

20
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,128
<i>...but at a price.</i>

21
00:03:08,673 --> 00:03:12,635
<i>His brotherhood was turned to stone.</i>

22
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:15,388
<i>And upon the portal's opening...</i>

23
00:03:15,555 --> 00:03:21,394
<i>...13 monsters were released
into our world.</i>

24
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,342
<i>The warrior king was left
to eternally walk the Earth...</i>

25
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:59,725
<i>...unable to die or forget
his horrible mistake.</i>

26
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:10,735
<i>And the monsters
that were unleashed...</i>

27
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:16,450
<i>...continue to plague mankind
to this very day.</i>

28
00:04:41,892 --> 00:04:43,811
Monsters.

29
00:04:44,353 --> 00:04:45,395
No.

30
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:48,523
We appreciate the generous donation...

31
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:52,611
...for the continued protection
of your village.

32
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:59,160
After all, the jungle
can be a very dangerous place.

33
00:05:00,869 --> 00:05:03,247
- Mama!
- Oh, she is dangerous.

34
00:05:03,414 --> 00:05:05,582
There's monsters out there.

35
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,774
Watch where you're going.

36
00:05:29,982 --> 00:05:33,027
There's a log on the road, senor.

37
00:05:33,194 --> 00:05:36,780
Well, if you're not too busy, remove it.

38
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:56,258
Who are you? Show yourself.

39
00:05:56,425 --> 00:06:00,638
The ghost of the jungle.
He punishes those who prey upon the weak.

40
00:06:00,805 --> 00:06:02,140
He's coming.

41
00:06:05,017 --> 00:06:07,728
I just remembered I left the stove on.
My wife hates that.

42
00:06:07,895 --> 00:06:11,482
<i>- Coward. Get back here.
- You're on your own, jefe.</i>

43
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:15,778
Show yourself.
Do you realize who you're dealing with?

44
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,494
What is this...? What?

45
00:06:35,798 --> 00:06:38,426
I am not afraid of a myth.

46
00:06:38,634 --> 00:06:41,680
I'm not afraid of a ghost.

47
00:06:47,185 --> 00:06:49,146
What are you?

48
00:07:06,412 --> 00:07:08,707
It's a miracle.

49
00:07:17,966 --> 00:07:21,178
The ghost of the jungle.

50
00:07:25,015 --> 00:07:27,559
There. That's where I saw him.

51
00:07:29,353 --> 00:07:30,896
Thank you.

52
00:07:31,188 --> 00:07:33,148
You'd better get home now.

53
00:07:33,315 --> 00:07:35,567
Do you know the ghost?

54
00:07:35,943 --> 00:07:38,445
He wasn't always a ghost.

55
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,721
Hello?

56
00:08:09,101 --> 00:08:11,479
Is anyone here?

57
00:08:13,271 --> 00:08:15,274
Hello?

58
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:25,117
It's a long way from the city
to just drop in.

59
00:08:27,995 --> 00:08:29,621
Leo.

60
00:08:32,624 --> 00:08:35,086
You came all the way down here
to look for me?

61
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:37,254
Actually, I was already here
on business.

62
00:08:37,421 --> 00:08:39,924
But then the local legend
started sounding familiar...

63
00:08:40,091 --> 00:08:41,592
...so I decided to snoop around.

64
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:44,762
- What kind of business?
- Ancient artifacts.

65
00:08:44,928 --> 00:08:47,223
Some tycoon with too much time
on his hands...

66
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,726
...has his heart set on a collection
of 3000-year-old statues.

67
00:08:50,893 --> 00:08:53,980
Well, you always did run
with a strange crowd, April.

68
00:08:54,146 --> 00:08:58,693
Yeah, well. Our strange crowd
hasn't been the same without you.

69
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:02,822
Things aren't looking so good
back home.

70
00:09:03,531 --> 00:09:05,324
How bad could it be?

71
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:08,160
Donnie's probably got everything
under control.

72
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:09,662
Sir? Sir. Sir.

73
00:09:11,206 --> 00:09:14,334
Did you turn the computer on?
Have you plugged it in?

74
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,668
Yeah, that would help.

75
00:09:15,876 --> 00:09:17,462
No, I'm not playing hard to get.

76
00:09:17,628 --> 00:09:20,297
I'm telling you, sir,
it's not that kind of phone line.

77
00:09:20,464 --> 00:09:24,009
I'm not your enemy. I'm just Donnie,
your friendly IT tech support...

78
00:09:24,218 --> 00:09:26,179
...here to help you 24 hours a day, sir.

79
00:09:26,721 --> 00:09:29,057
Yeah, I'm sorry. Ma'am.

80
00:09:29,933 --> 00:09:34,396
But Donnie's a genius.
Why would he take a job like that?

81
00:09:34,562 --> 00:09:35,938
At least he's keeping busy.

82
00:09:36,105 --> 00:09:39,191
Well, if he's doing that,
who's keeping an eye on Mikey?

83
00:09:39,358 --> 00:09:44,238
<i>Mike's gotten into
the entertainment business.</i>

84
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,783
Yeah.

85
00:09:46,907 --> 00:09:51,078
Happy birthday from Cowabunga Carl.

86
00:09:53,456 --> 00:09:56,292
Take it easy, little dudes.
I bruise easily.

87
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:59,796
Hey, black-and-blue clashes with green,
dudes. Hey, that's...

88
00:09:59,963 --> 00:10:01,381
He's a big hit.

89
00:10:01,548 --> 00:10:04,884
All right. Let's hear it.
What's Raph doing?

90
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:09,055
No one really knows.
He just sleeps all day.

91
00:10:09,264 --> 00:10:11,224
Well, what's he do all night?

92
00:10:24,237 --> 00:10:28,867
<i>2802, 2802, burglary in progress
at 55th and Broadway.</i>

93
00:10:29,034 --> 00:10:31,453
<i>Suspects considered
armed and dangerous.</i>

94
00:10:31,786 --> 00:10:33,998
Time to punch in.

95
00:10:52,307 --> 00:10:55,310
Good work, boys. That was easier
than I thought it was gonna be.

96
00:10:55,477 --> 00:10:58,313
Hey, look, guys. I grabbed a toaster.

97
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,859
I love your work ethic, Tommy.
It's an inspiration to us all.

98
00:11:11,493 --> 00:11:12,995
What was that?

99
00:11:13,204 --> 00:11:15,456
What's going on, guys?

100
00:11:16,582 --> 00:11:18,041
What in the...?

101
00:11:25,007 --> 00:11:27,927
Looks like it's just you and me, shaky.

102
00:11:28,678 --> 00:11:32,723
Take it easy. I'm not gonna hurt you...

103
00:11:33,181 --> 00:11:34,433
...much.

104
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,030
I love when they play hard to get.

105
00:11:57,539 --> 00:11:59,667
The Nightwatcher.

106
00:12:00,293 --> 00:12:02,211
- He's doing our job for us again.
- Tommy.

107
00:12:02,378 --> 00:12:05,047
- Keep your hands to yourself.
- Hey, who's tickling me?

108
00:12:06,632 --> 00:12:09,176
Your training period ended a year ago.

109
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,804
And Splinter says
you don't write anymore.

110
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:14,640
Splinter sent me down here
to become a better leader.

111
00:12:14,807 --> 00:12:17,143
I can't go back a failure.

112
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:21,230
Besides, these people need me
more than my brothers do.

113
00:12:21,522 --> 00:12:23,191
If Master Splinter were here...

114
00:12:23,358 --> 00:12:26,027
...he would ask you,
"What is your heart telling you?"

115
00:12:26,235 --> 00:12:30,531
I don't know.
I just know something's missing.

116
00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:34,410
Your brothers need you, Leo.

117
00:12:34,994 --> 00:12:37,205
They're lost without you.

118
00:12:39,749 --> 00:12:41,668
Leo?

119
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:26,921
Why skate a halfpipe
when you can skate a sewer pipe?

120
00:13:36,806 --> 00:13:39,559
Sewer's up, bra.

121
00:13:43,646 --> 00:13:45,274
Hey.

122
00:13:54,824 --> 00:13:56,535
Cowabunga.

123
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,671
Dude. Going down.

124
00:14:09,173 --> 00:14:10,966
Yeah.

125
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:23,520
Here's Mikey.

126
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:26,314
Guys?

127
00:14:26,481 --> 00:14:28,150
Anyone?

128
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,569
Hello?

129
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,780
Whatever.

130
00:14:33,155 --> 00:14:35,824
This place used to be fun.

131
00:14:37,535 --> 00:14:40,913
<i>And with rocketing interest rates,
that's bad news for homeowners...</i>

132
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,959
<i>...as the real-estate market
continues its downward spiral.</i>

133
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,421
<i>Coming up, the vigilante known
as Nightwatcher strikes again.</i>

134
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,842
<i>Now, I can't say for sure,
but he was definitely an alien.</i>

135
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:56,345
<i>I think it's a disgrace, taking the law
into your own hands like that.</i>

136
00:14:56,554 --> 00:14:59,265
<i>- Leave it to the police.
- Up next...</i>

137
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:03,310
I remember how that used to feel,
busting up crime syndicates.

138
00:15:03,477 --> 00:15:07,773
Sure, they had a bunch of guns,
but they weren't like these guns.

139
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,402
Why do you do this to yourself, Mikey?
Those glory days are over.

140
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:15,364
Forget about them. Get on with your life.
Concentrate on your work.

141
00:15:15,573 --> 00:15:18,576
Yeah, yeah. Spoken like a true has-been.

142
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,370
Well, look who woke up.

143
00:15:21,537 --> 00:15:24,707
I suppose you think the Nightwatcher
is some kind of hero.

144
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,711
Beats sitting around doing nothing
while dirtbags run free.

145
00:15:28,877 --> 00:15:31,798
I would love to know what it is
that you do that's so great.

146
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:34,634
We're contributing around here.
All you do is sleep.

147
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:39,013
Yeah, I do nothing. You're right.
You got me all figured out.

148
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,684
I know that your attitude has been
a source of contention to this team.

149
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,519
You think fear is the best way
to accomplish things.

150
00:15:45,686 --> 00:15:48,981
First of all, this team you speak of
doesn't exist anymore.

151
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,775
And second of all...

152
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:52,401
Raphael.

153
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,240
Enough.

154
00:15:58,032 --> 00:15:59,367
I think I made my point.

155
00:15:59,534 --> 00:16:01,661
That doesn't prove anything.

156
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:07,083
Why couldn't you send him away
for training?

157
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:11,129
Donatello, this home
has become like an empty shell.

158
00:16:11,296 --> 00:16:14,925
Each of your brothers
has strengths and weaknesses.

159
00:16:15,091 --> 00:16:18,219
You must learn to be strong
when they are weak.

160
00:16:18,386 --> 00:16:21,055
If you don't learn to recognize this...

161
00:16:21,222 --> 00:16:25,310
...then all hope is lost for our family.

162
00:16:41,535 --> 00:16:43,411
Keep it coming.

163
00:16:50,669 --> 00:16:52,087
Hey, careful.

164
00:16:52,253 --> 00:16:53,880
Those aren't souvenirs.

165
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,883
Sorry about that, ma'am.

166
00:17:00,136 --> 00:17:01,889
Where are you, Casey?

167
00:17:03,473 --> 00:17:06,310
Come on. Come on, pick up.

168
00:17:06,935 --> 00:17:09,146
Don't do this to me again. Not now.

169
00:17:09,313 --> 00:17:13,567
<i>Casey can't come to the phone right now
because we're hardly working.</i>

170
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,571
This better be good.

171
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:23,201
<i>Casey, I am standing on the dock with
a priceless statue and no delivery truck.</i>

172
00:17:23,368 --> 00:17:27,080
<i>- So my question is, where are you?
- April.</i>

173
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:30,625
<i>Hey, babe. I am so sorry.
I set the alarm clock, but...</i>

174
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,381
It's broken. The clock...

175
00:17:38,383 --> 00:17:41,345
It's bad enough that you're
out every night playing vigilante...

176
00:17:41,554 --> 00:17:44,848
<i>- ...but we've got a deadline to meet.
- I'm sorry.</i>

177
00:17:45,057 --> 00:17:48,477
Oh, wait, babe, real quick.
You left a message saying you found Leo.

178
00:17:48,644 --> 00:17:51,647
<i>- I mean, is he there with you?
- No.</i>

179
00:17:51,814 --> 00:17:54,858
I found him. He's not coming back.

180
00:17:56,068 --> 00:17:59,863
But didn't you tell him how weird things
have gotten with the Turtles?

181
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,866
<i>Look, Casey, we're gonna lose
the biggest client we have...</i>

182
00:18:03,033 --> 00:18:04,827
<i>...if you don't get down here.</i>

183
00:18:04,994 --> 00:18:07,955
All right. I'm on my way.

184
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,631
Please tell me we're getting paid
by the pound here.

185
00:18:18,257 --> 00:18:20,051
Is this place a museum or what?

186
00:18:20,259 --> 00:18:23,262
- You've never heard of Winterscorp?
- That's what I'm telling you.

187
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:27,600
They're into everything: Real estate,
technology, pharmaceuticals, hair gel.

188
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:29,810
- I don't wear hair gel.
- Really?

189
00:18:29,977 --> 00:18:33,314
I'm the caveman type, au naturel.

190
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,942
Just make sure you don't
touch anything in here.

191
00:18:36,109 --> 00:18:38,819
Hey, I was born careful.

192
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,364
Hope that wasn't expensive.

193
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:46,327
Oh, wait... Just... I'm...

194
00:18:46,494 --> 00:18:49,997
- Oh, boy.
- Please tell me that wasn't you.

195
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,803
- Mr. Winters.
- Miss O'Neil.

196
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:06,556
All the pieces are coming together.

197
00:19:06,723 --> 00:19:09,934
Oh, my. This is my associate, Casey.

198
00:19:10,143 --> 00:19:12,437
- Nice to meet you, Kenny.
- Boyfriend. It's Casey.

199
00:19:12,645 --> 00:19:15,273
- So you were successful?
- Yes. The fourth general.

200
00:19:15,482 --> 00:19:17,191
I want to ask you before I go...

201
00:19:17,358 --> 00:19:20,820
...if I could take one last look?

202
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:34,417
I believe this is the one
they call General Akeela?

203
00:19:34,584 --> 00:19:38,463
It's actually "Aguila,"
but that was a good try.

204
00:19:40,214 --> 00:19:43,301
These statues may appear
to be only stone...

205
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:47,472
...but they're like family to me.
I didn't choose them.

206
00:19:47,681 --> 00:19:51,393
Friends you can choose,
but never your family.

207
00:19:51,602 --> 00:19:53,478
Okay, then.

208
00:19:55,105 --> 00:19:57,774
Take care, Mr. Winters.

209
00:20:05,031 --> 00:20:07,576
If you've come to kill me,
could you make it fast?

210
00:20:07,742 --> 00:20:11,621
I've got a shareholders' meeting at 10.
I'd rather miss it.

211
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:18,963
If we had come here to hurt you,
you'd be hurting already.

212
00:20:19,129 --> 00:20:22,341
The Foot Clan and I
have come to hear your offer.

213
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:26,387
Well, it appears that today
is my lucky day.

214
00:20:27,012 --> 00:20:29,473
I must warn you,
we do not come cheap.

215
00:20:29,681 --> 00:20:32,184
Does it look like
money is of any concern to me?

216
00:20:32,392 --> 00:20:35,353
Only time is of the essence, my dear.

217
00:20:35,937 --> 00:20:37,773
Since you're so rich and powerful...

218
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,901
...what is it we could possibly have
to offer you?

219
00:20:41,068 --> 00:20:43,069
I need you to be my eyes and ears.

220
00:20:43,236 --> 00:20:45,489
I have some friends coming to town...

221
00:20:45,656 --> 00:20:48,784
...that I'd like to roll out
the red carpet for.

222
00:20:50,035 --> 00:20:53,914
Greet them warmly
and bring them to me.

223
00:20:54,707 --> 00:20:57,418
And how will we know these friends?

224
00:20:57,585 --> 00:21:01,797
Don't worry, they're impossible to miss.

225
00:21:28,824 --> 00:21:30,659
And you keep them up. Got that?

226
00:21:30,951 --> 00:21:33,579
And don't let me catch you
calling the cops.

227
00:21:33,788 --> 00:21:35,414
What? Not again.

228
00:21:40,336 --> 00:21:43,088
Didn't I take care of you last week?

229
00:21:43,255 --> 00:21:46,967
Hey. Oh, no. Come on, now. Wait.

230
00:21:47,134 --> 00:21:50,262
I'm very disappointed in you,
knucklehead.

231
00:21:50,471 --> 00:21:52,724
Guess night school's in session.

232
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,934
Hope I'm not disturbing class.

233
00:21:55,142 --> 00:21:57,728
Hey, Nightwatcher,
need any teaching assistants?

234
00:21:57,895 --> 00:21:59,856
Oh, no. Casey.

235
00:22:00,022 --> 00:22:03,901
I got this one covered, pal.
Thanks, but no, thanks.

236
00:22:04,068 --> 00:22:09,157
You think you own these rooftops?
I happen to think you could use my help.

237
00:22:09,782 --> 00:22:11,200
And I could use a sidekick.

238
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:14,495
You may have everyone else fooled,
but you haven't fooled me, Raph.

239
00:22:14,662 --> 00:22:17,331
Yeah, well, guess what, pal.
Now you...

240
00:22:17,498 --> 00:22:20,794
Hey, wait a minute.
How did you know it was me?

241
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:25,132
Wasn't that hard, man. You know,
you look like a big, metal turtle.

242
00:22:26,424 --> 00:22:28,468
It's that obvious, huh?

243
00:22:29,552 --> 00:22:34,056
- I should've stayed in law school.
- Ain't that cute? He's trying to get away.

244
00:22:38,186 --> 00:22:39,980
Well, looks like I got a sidekick.

245
00:22:40,147 --> 00:22:43,441
Yeah, right. You're the sidekick.

246
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,329
What, is it performance art?
I don't get it.

247
00:22:49,342 --> 00:22:51,199
What was I supposed to do...

248
00:22:51,366 --> 00:22:54,160
...sit around, wait for Leo to come back
and save the day?

249
00:22:54,327 --> 00:22:56,413
I mean, we haven't
heard word one from him...

250
00:22:56,579 --> 00:22:59,416
...since Splinter sent him away
on his little vacation.

251
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:03,003
You think these lowlifes take vacations
at the first sign of pressure?

252
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:07,049
No. The criminal element of this city
may be guilty of a lot of things...

253
00:23:07,215 --> 00:23:09,551
...but being quitters ain't one of them.

254
00:23:10,385 --> 00:23:12,679
You know, I don't even care
about Leo anymore.

255
00:23:12,887 --> 00:23:14,514
Kind of hope he never comes back.

256
00:23:14,723 --> 00:23:17,517
Come on, aren't you being
a little hard on the guy?

257
00:23:17,726 --> 00:23:19,436
I don't know. It's possible.

258
00:23:19,603 --> 00:23:22,648
I guess if I could live anywhere
other than the city, I'd go too.

259
00:23:22,814 --> 00:23:24,983
But I could never leave this place.

260
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:29,279
I can't even sleep without the sound
of the subway rumbling over my head.

261
00:23:29,446 --> 00:23:32,532
I guess it comes from growing up
with a houseful of brothers.

262
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,035
I'm not trying to tell you what to do.

263
00:23:35,202 --> 00:23:39,164
I'm just saying that if it was my brother,
I'd find a way to work it out.

264
00:23:39,373 --> 00:23:40,999
But that's just me.

265
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:44,169
I got my own issues, you know?
Like back at home, with April.

266
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:46,714
There's this whole thing
about settling down...

267
00:23:46,922 --> 00:23:48,965
...that makes me miss the old times.

268
00:23:49,132 --> 00:23:52,552
I don't know if I can be the grownup
she needs me to be.

269
00:23:57,432 --> 00:23:59,226
Good talk, Raph.

270
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,088
Arise, my brothers. Arise, dear sister.

271
00:24:28,255 --> 00:24:30,258
The Stars of Kikan align.

272
00:24:30,466 --> 00:24:35,178
All ye generals,
wake from your stone slumber.

273
00:25:22,351 --> 00:25:24,520
Dude.

274
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,316
Dude.

275
00:25:48,628 --> 00:25:50,463
Enter.

276
00:25:51,297 --> 00:25:53,799
Kneel, my son.

277
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,141
I return from my training, master.

278
00:26:02,308 --> 00:26:07,480
I was so caught up in my own world,
I forgot about everyone else.

279
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:11,443
I'm sorry I failed.

280
00:26:13,403 --> 00:26:16,239
On the contrary, my son...

281
00:26:19,576 --> 00:26:22,370
...now you are much stronger.

282
00:26:31,713 --> 00:26:34,174
Your strength is needed here now.

283
00:26:34,341 --> 00:26:40,222
You owe me no apology,
but perhaps you should talk to Raphael.

284
00:26:40,389 --> 00:26:44,684
Your absence has been
particularly difficult for him...

285
00:26:45,143 --> 00:26:47,563
...though he'll never admit it.

286
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:51,066
I'm certain things will be back to normal
in no time, master.

287
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:57,739
Good. Because until you can act
as one, you are forbidden to fight.

288
00:26:58,156 --> 00:27:00,117
Yes, sensei.

289
00:27:01,284 --> 00:27:04,079
I have missed you, Leonardo.

290
00:27:04,245 --> 00:27:06,832
I've missed you too, Father.

291
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,418
Raphael.

292
00:27:09,585 --> 00:27:12,504
Your brother is home.

293
00:27:16,508 --> 00:27:19,470
- Hey.
- Hey.

294
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,932
Welcome home.

295
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,058
Yeah. Thanks.

296
00:27:25,225 --> 00:27:29,355
Well, I'm going to bed.

297
00:27:31,857 --> 00:27:35,361
Hey, Leo's back. Better go say
hello before he leaves again.

298
00:27:35,527 --> 00:27:38,155
- What? Leo.
- Hey.

299
00:27:38,322 --> 00:27:40,574
- Hey.
- Huh, Leo?

300
00:27:40,741 --> 00:27:43,119
- Is that really you?
- Yeah.

301
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:47,497
- I'm, like, dreaming, aren't I?
- No, Mikey, you're not dreaming.

302
00:27:47,664 --> 00:27:52,127
Oh, good.
I have nightmares about birthday parties.

303
00:27:55,297 --> 00:27:58,217
Okay, Leo, I'll bite.
What are we doing up here?

304
00:27:58,384 --> 00:28:01,470
I told Splinter
I'd get this team in shape again.

305
00:28:01,637 --> 00:28:06,476
Hey, I've been training. Since you left,
my video-game scores have, like, doubled.

306
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:09,312
Right, and while you've been
playing games, brother...

307
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,647
...Nightwatcher's
come into the neighborhood...

308
00:28:11,814 --> 00:28:14,776
...like some kind of vigilante showboat.
But his days are done.

309
00:28:14,983 --> 00:28:16,819
Hey, you went AWOL, Leo...

310
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:20,114
...and the Nightwatcher
was the only guy to pick up the slack.

311
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:23,325
Crime never took a break. You did.

312
00:28:23,492 --> 00:28:27,329
I heard his bike turns into a plane or,
like, a jetpack.

313
00:28:27,496 --> 00:28:30,541
Hey, Don, you're so smart,
why don't we have jetpacks?

314
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:33,878
That's good, Mikey. I don't even
trust you with a driver's license.

315
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,631
Have you seen
the way this guy behaves...

316
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,179
Someone's cranky.

317
00:28:46,682 --> 00:28:49,269
- Okay, jungle boy. Grab a vine.
- Raph, wait.

318
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,103
Splinter told us not to fight.

319
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:54,273
"Jungle boy." Good one.

320
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,612
All right. But remember,
we're only up here for training.

321
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:02,740
You know what I always say,
"Train by doing, dude."

322
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,494
Mikey, when have you ever said that?

323
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,955
You smell that?
It's like a monkey cage up here.

324
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,794
Wow, good news is,
there's a bunch of Foot ninjas...

325
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,297
...getting the snot kicked out of them.

326
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:25,305
Bad news is, this thing
is gonna run out of bodies soon.

327
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,433
Yeah, so?
You think we should help these guys?

328
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,020
I'd rather enjoy the show.
What do you say, fearless leader?

329
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,980
- We're not...
- I say we stop talking.

330
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:43,407
Come here, fuzzy wuzzy.

331
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,909
You.

332
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:51,456
I think we're getting off
on the wrong foot here.

333
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,794
- We're trying to help you.
- Never.

334
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,256
Team.

335
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,595
Wait, the Shredder's dead.

336
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:08,140
Who are you working for?

337
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,105
Hey, a little help, O fearless one.

338
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:21,445
That was too easy.

339
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,614
Like I said, too easy.

340
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,410
Bad dog.

341
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,376
Look at me. Found the elevator.

342
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:40,255
Oh, my shoulder.

343
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:42,216
My spleen.

344
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:57,147
This place needed a skylight.

345
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,822
This is why we need jetpacks.

346
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:08,659
- Okay, any more bright ideas?
- How about this?

347
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:16,542
When this is over,
I'm totally calling the architect.

348
00:31:56,332 --> 00:32:01,212
Wait a minute. How did something
that big just disappear? It doesn't...

349
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:03,881
Dude, it's the cops.

350
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:10,389
Raph. Raph!

351
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:21,483
Oh, yeah. The turtles are back, dudes.

352
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:25,612
I give us a 10 for style,
an eight for skill...

353
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:29,032
...and a two for stealth.

354
00:32:37,165 --> 00:32:39,709
What seems to be the problem?

355
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:43,380
The problem is that we were hired
to merely patrol the city...

356
00:32:43,588 --> 00:32:46,049
...and report anything strange to you.

357
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:50,887
You never said anything about monsters.

358
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:58,979
Now, I'm sorry that your illustrious group
have been reduced to hired guns...

359
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:02,941
...but I believe we made a deal, Karai.

360
00:33:03,108 --> 00:33:05,277
And I expect you to honor it.

361
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:10,407
You do understand honor, don't you?

362
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:15,787
So how did we fare?

363
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:24,797
My, my, my. And what is your name?

364
00:33:27,716 --> 00:33:30,093
Were there any problems, general?

365
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,263
None, my lord.

366
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:35,724
Then show these fools
how a true warrior acts.

367
00:33:35,891 --> 00:33:38,101
Keep them on schedule
in completing their task.

368
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:39,937
We do not need any help.

369
00:33:40,104 --> 00:33:44,609
Nevertheless, Karai,
I trust my family more than I trust you.

370
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:48,778
You may be the eyes and ears,
but they are the muscle.

371
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:52,116
They will help you gather
the remaining 12 of these abominations...

372
00:33:52,283 --> 00:33:55,619
...so we can finally see
our birthrights fulfilled.

373
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,123
It's going to be quite a party.

374
00:34:04,586 --> 00:34:08,715
Dudes, did anyone get the license plate
of that thing that hit us last night?

375
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:10,217
My head.

376
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:14,597
Okay, that was just weird. I mean,
first the Foot, then that hideous monster.

377
00:34:14,764 --> 00:34:18,809
Yeah. It looked like your mom, dude.

378
00:34:18,976 --> 00:34:22,563
Yeah, that would make her
your mom too, doofus.

379
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,273
Yeah, whatever.

380
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,776
Keep laughing.
Last night was an embarrassment.

381
00:34:26,943 --> 00:34:30,196
I'll tell you what's embarrassing.
You can't follow a single order.

382
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:33,365
Oh, how cute.
You've been back for five minutes...

383
00:34:33,532 --> 00:34:36,201
...and now you're schooling us
on your master plan?

384
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:38,454
Okay, so this is my fault now,
huh, Raph?

385
00:34:38,621 --> 00:34:40,873
I'm the only one
that has to be responsible?

386
00:34:41,082 --> 00:34:43,001
Hey, you're the trained master, not me.

387
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:45,461
Dudes, can it. Here comes Splinter.

388
00:34:54,387 --> 00:34:56,138
Good morning, my sons.

389
00:34:56,305 --> 00:34:58,308
- Good morning, sensei.
- Sup?

390
00:35:02,979 --> 00:35:06,566
Every ninja's day should start
with a healthy breakfast.

391
00:35:06,733 --> 00:35:11,487
It fills me with pride
to see you boys together again.

392
00:35:11,654 --> 00:35:15,658
If anyone needs me,
I'll be watching my stories.

393
00:35:16,701 --> 00:35:19,704
- Hothead.
- Splinter Jr.

394
00:35:20,622 --> 00:35:24,417
Cody is going to break up with Donna.
I just know it.

395
00:35:24,626 --> 00:35:27,920
<i>We interrupt the Gilmore Girls
for this special news report.</i>

396
00:35:28,087 --> 00:35:29,673
<i>Monsters loose in the city?</i>

397
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,258
<i>Strange reports are coming in
about an incident...</i>

398
00:35:32,425 --> 00:35:34,844
<i>...that sounds like something
out of science fiction.</i>

399
00:35:35,011 --> 00:35:36,679
Boys!

400
00:35:38,307 --> 00:35:42,060
Leonardo,
I am most disappointed in you.

401
00:35:42,227 --> 00:35:44,437
You are the eldest of your brothers.

402
00:35:44,854 --> 00:35:49,818
I was counting on you to bring order
to the chaos of this family.

403
00:35:49,985 --> 00:35:53,989
This is why I have forbidden
any surface activity.

404
00:35:54,156 --> 00:35:57,033
We cannot return to the surface
to fight evil...

405
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,661
...if we continue to fight each other.

406
00:35:59,828 --> 00:36:02,455
But Master Splinter,
how can I be expected to do so...

407
00:36:02,622 --> 00:36:06,584
There are no excuses
when you are the leader, my student.

408
00:36:10,672 --> 00:36:13,133
We have to go out
and find who's responsible for this.

409
00:36:13,342 --> 00:36:14,718
There ain't no other solution.

410
00:36:14,884 --> 00:36:17,888
Save the brute-vigilante junk
for that Nightwatchman.

411
00:36:18,054 --> 00:36:19,389
- Nightwatcher.
- Nightwatcher.

412
00:36:19,556 --> 00:36:21,475
Yeah, whatever.

413
00:36:21,642 --> 00:36:23,518
I'm going out.

414
00:38:23,557 --> 00:38:25,725
<i>Witnesses say
there are holes in the floors...</i>

415
00:38:25,892 --> 00:38:29,979
<i>...as if something or someone had just
blasted straight down through them...</i>

416
00:38:30,146 --> 00:38:33,024
<i>...leaving authorities
scratching their heads.</i>

417
00:38:34,526 --> 00:38:37,195
Well, at least some people
care about justice these days.

418
00:38:37,362 --> 00:38:39,323
Hey, Casey.

419
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,783
- Raph?
- Meet me on the roof, okay?

420
00:38:41,992 --> 00:38:43,576
What is it?

421
00:38:43,743 --> 00:38:46,621
The roof.
You know what the roof is, don't you?

422
00:38:46,788 --> 00:38:48,247
Pushy sidekick.

423
00:38:48,456 --> 00:38:51,084
<i>We've gotten this image
in from an amateur cameraman...</i>

424
00:38:51,251 --> 00:38:53,253
<i>...and I do stress "amateur. "</i>

425
00:38:55,338 --> 00:38:57,924
Casey, come look at this.

426
00:39:02,638 --> 00:39:04,472
Be safe.

427
00:39:07,767 --> 00:39:09,144
What's this all about, Raph?

428
00:39:09,352 --> 00:39:11,813
We got bigger things to worry about
than criminals.

429
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,482
Like what?

430
00:39:17,694 --> 00:39:19,195
Come on.

431
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,965
I think we lost it.

432
00:39:38,132 --> 00:39:40,717
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

433
00:39:41,093 --> 00:39:42,969
I don't think so.

434
00:39:52,312 --> 00:39:53,439
What's going on, Raph?

435
00:39:53,606 --> 00:39:55,732
Did I mention
we ran into a monster last night?

436
00:39:55,899 --> 00:39:59,695
No, you kind of failed to tell me
about that one, buddy.

437
00:40:00,946 --> 00:40:03,532
You do know I only have
a wooden bat, don't you?

438
00:40:09,622 --> 00:40:12,666
The Foot? I thought they were history.

439
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,261
And now we got walking statues?
You got a plan for those?

440
00:40:24,428 --> 00:40:27,056
Yeah. Hey, those are a first for me too.

441
00:40:27,431 --> 00:40:29,808
And who knows?
These guys might be friendly.

442
00:40:35,856 --> 00:40:37,357
Friendly.

443
00:40:44,907 --> 00:40:47,743
Wait a second. Those statues look...

444
00:40:56,294 --> 00:40:57,920
Witnesses.

445
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,006
Watch out.

446
00:41:04,177 --> 00:41:06,178
I don't feel so good.

447
00:41:11,309 --> 00:41:13,018
That can't be good.

448
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:18,065
That's just rude.

449
00:41:20,985 --> 00:41:22,737
Hey, wait up.

450
00:41:24,155 --> 00:41:25,698
- Raph?
- Come here.

451
00:41:25,865 --> 00:41:28,951
- What, you never heard of smoke pellets?
- Warn me next time.

452
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,453
I got allergies.

453
00:41:32,663 --> 00:41:35,291
Come on.
That's the second mask this week.

454
00:41:37,251 --> 00:41:38,753
They'll never find us in here.

455
00:41:40,005 --> 00:41:43,425
Stay with me, now.
We'll be out of here soon.

456
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,475
No.

457
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:55,228
And I thought Girl Scouts were pushy.

458
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:02,277
Some people just can't take a hint.

459
00:42:02,444 --> 00:42:07,949
<i>This is the police. You on the roof,
put your hands behind your...</i>

460
00:42:08,783 --> 00:42:11,495
<i>What is that? Tommy, you see this?</i>

461
00:42:14,623 --> 00:42:16,332
Yeah, you better run.

462
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:20,837
I gotta hand it to you, Raph...

463
00:42:21,046 --> 00:42:23,756
...you sure know how
to show a lady a good time.

464
00:42:24,299 --> 00:42:25,801
Raph?

465
00:42:27,468 --> 00:42:31,681
Oh, no.
I gotta get you someplace safe, pal.

466
00:42:35,435 --> 00:42:38,272
My compliments to the chef.

467
00:42:43,902 --> 00:42:45,279
Anyone for dessert?

468
00:42:45,445 --> 00:42:46,864
- No.
- Yes.

469
00:42:47,071 --> 00:42:49,700
Cowabunga Carl Party Services.
Cowabunga, dude.

470
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:52,058
<i>Raph's hurt. You
need to get over here.</i>

471
00:42:52,071 --> 00:42:53,120
<i>Slow down, April.</i>

472
00:42:53,287 --> 00:42:56,331
<i>- What happened to Raph?
- I don't know. He's unconscious.</i>

473
00:42:56,498 --> 00:42:58,292
We'll be right there.

474
00:43:06,967 --> 00:43:09,136
Leo. You came back.

475
00:43:09,303 --> 00:43:11,012
Leo.

476
00:43:11,179 --> 00:43:14,100
Sorry the reunion
isn't under better circumstances.

477
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:17,853
Nice pad, kids.

478
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:19,479
Oh, hey, Raph.

479
00:43:20,689 --> 00:43:23,233
Well, his vital signs seem to be okay.

480
00:43:23,859 --> 00:43:27,070
Pupil dilation is normal.

481
00:43:34,786 --> 00:43:39,083
Some sort of stone.
Probably obsidian, I think.

482
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,753
Well, is he gonna be all right?

483
00:43:42,336 --> 00:43:44,588
You're still here?
Go back to your jungle.

484
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:47,591
Well, at least
his personality's still intact.

485
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,512
And there's an engraving on it.
Looks South American.

486
00:43:52,138 --> 00:43:54,556
That's your department, April.

487
00:43:57,185 --> 00:44:00,855
Would it help if I told you that those
statues you collected for Winters...

488
00:44:01,022 --> 00:44:03,733
...were shooting these things
at me and Raph?

489
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:10,072
"The legend of Yoatl." It can't be.

490
00:44:10,698 --> 00:44:12,283
It was just a myth...

491
00:44:12,492 --> 00:44:15,995
...a scary story the locals told kids
around a campfire.

492
00:44:16,162 --> 00:44:18,289
Whoa, what are you talking about?

493
00:44:19,332 --> 00:44:24,379
They say 3000 years ago,
some great warrior...

494
00:44:24,546 --> 00:44:29,133
<i>...actually found a portal
to another dimension.</i>

495
00:44:36,099 --> 00:44:37,808
<i>And when the portal opened...</i>

496
00:44:38,017 --> 00:44:41,646
<i>...the energy from it
gave the warrior eternal life.</i>

497
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:46,067
<i>But it also turned his generals to stone.</i>

498
00:44:46,401 --> 00:44:49,987
<i>What if this warrior
just kept living forever?</i>

499
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:53,115
<i>He would spend
the rest of his days in regret...</i>

500
00:44:53,282 --> 00:44:57,245
<i>...spending all of his riches
and all of his power...</i>

501
00:44:57,411 --> 00:45:00,499
<i>...to find a way
to revive his stone generals.</i>

502
00:45:05,628 --> 00:45:08,422
<i>Maybe, just maybe...</i>

503
00:45:08,589 --> 00:45:11,551
<i>...he's built a new empire.</i>

504
00:45:26,608 --> 00:45:29,861
But, hey, like I said, it's just a myth.

505
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,033
If you ask me, guys, this has
Winters' name written all over it.

506
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,036
- How do you figure that, Donnie?
- Yeah.

507
00:45:38,203 --> 00:45:42,040
Because this has Winters' name
written all over it.

508
00:45:42,249 --> 00:45:44,834
Now I know who to thank
for this shot in the arm.

509
00:45:45,001 --> 00:45:47,463
So where do we find this guy
and his stone jokers?

510
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:50,132
We're not going
until we get Splinter's blessing.

511
00:45:50,299 --> 00:45:53,885
You're gonna quote a rulebook to me
that you ain't been following for a year?

512
00:45:54,094 --> 00:45:57,389
If you got something you wanna
get off your shell, now's the time.

513
00:45:57,556 --> 00:46:00,642
But I'm not gonna stand here
and debate Splinter's orders with you.

514
00:46:02,728 --> 00:46:05,480
Fine, then. I quit.

515
00:46:06,899 --> 00:46:09,526
Hey, Raph. Don't do it, man.

516
00:46:09,735 --> 00:46:14,198
Sometimes just taking a breather
is the best thing to do.

517
00:46:16,199 --> 00:46:17,910
Whatever.

518
00:46:55,113 --> 00:46:57,617
To picking up the pieces.

519
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:00,870
What is it?

520
00:47:01,037 --> 00:47:04,623
Two creatures remain, my lord.

521
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:08,794
Well, by all means, then,
let's finish it.

522
00:47:08,961 --> 00:47:13,591
And you will finally be free
of your stone prison.

523
00:47:13,758 --> 00:47:18,846
But if the curse is broken,
we will no longer be immortal.

524
00:47:19,472 --> 00:47:22,892
Brother, do not question my command.

525
00:47:28,356 --> 00:47:30,816
- Here we go, now.
- So, what are we looking for?

526
00:47:30,983 --> 00:47:34,153
Well, according to these star charts,
the portal is set to open...

527
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:38,240
...directly over Winters Tower
in the next 24 hours.

528
00:47:38,407 --> 00:47:41,494
So the legend is right.
Three thousand years.

529
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:45,498
And when the portal opens, we'll lose
the city to monsters within hours.

530
00:47:45,664 --> 00:47:50,503
Within days, the country.
And within weeks, the world.

531
00:47:52,464 --> 00:47:57,260
Oh, so it's like Halley's comet,
only monsters come out?

532
00:47:58,886 --> 00:48:01,639
Yes. I guess so.

533
00:48:02,849 --> 00:48:04,935
I'm smart.

534
00:48:07,771 --> 00:48:09,106
I'm okay.

535
00:48:09,271 --> 00:48:10,815
Why do we need Raph, anyway?

536
00:48:11,024 --> 00:48:13,985
It's his temper that always
jeopardizes all our missions.

537
00:48:14,152 --> 00:48:17,697
Okay, Leo. Whatever you say.
Nobody was talking about him.

538
00:48:18,323 --> 00:48:24,079
Leonardo, this team
you are so eager to lead is incomplete.

539
00:48:24,246 --> 00:48:26,956
You know what you must do.

540
00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:30,961
Yes, sensei.

541
00:48:41,054 --> 00:48:45,683
Generals, I think our brother
has plans to betray us.

542
00:48:46,351 --> 00:48:51,231
The 13th monster must not be found.

543
00:48:54,568 --> 00:48:57,654
<i>Why don't we take one more call
about these monster sightings?</i>

544
00:48:57,821 --> 00:49:00,074
<i>Suffern, New Jersey, you're on.</i>

545
00:49:01,366 --> 00:49:03,994
Monster sightings.

546
00:49:23,597 --> 00:49:26,809
<i>A monster!</i>

547
00:49:26,976 --> 00:49:28,643
<i>Attention, all on-duty officers:</i>

548
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:31,355
<i>Report of a disturbance on 32nd.
No units available.</i>

549
00:49:31,522 --> 00:49:33,565
They're playing my song.

550
00:49:36,818 --> 00:49:39,529
Where are the cops?
How come the cops haven't shown up?

551
00:49:39,696 --> 00:49:42,700
Just remember what my analyst said,
just go to my happy place.

552
00:49:42,867 --> 00:49:46,078
Everything's gonna be fine. Happy place.
I'm feeling good. I'm thin.

553
00:49:46,245 --> 00:49:49,081
Don't get up. I'll serve myself.

554
00:49:54,629 --> 00:49:56,714
Look at you. Ain't you cute?

555
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,467
You want a butt-kicking, little fella?
Yes, you do. You do.

556
00:50:00,634 --> 00:50:05,055
Come on, I'm gonna drop-kick you
to hurty town. Come on, little guy.

557
00:50:07,641 --> 00:50:10,728
Get off of me, you little monster.

558
00:50:15,357 --> 00:50:17,401
You're scratching the helmet.

559
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:22,407
Okay, that was different.

560
00:50:31,498 --> 00:50:35,252
Hey, this thing ain't rustproof.
Get off of me.

561
00:50:47,306 --> 00:50:49,100
Come on.

562
00:50:58,818 --> 00:51:00,945
How about a snack, little fella?

563
00:51:01,988 --> 00:51:03,489
Catch.

564
00:51:18,379 --> 00:51:21,007
Keep on running,
you filthy little hermit crab.

565
00:51:21,174 --> 00:51:23,843
That spicy meatball's on the house.

566
00:51:24,386 --> 00:51:26,679
Big guy, please don't hurt me.

567
00:51:26,846 --> 00:51:29,224
What? I'm not robbing you,
I'm helping you.

568
00:51:29,391 --> 00:51:32,519
Okay, whatever you say, sir.
Please, I got kids in college.

569
00:51:32,727 --> 00:51:33,853
Community college.

570
00:51:34,187 --> 00:51:36,064
Here you go, pal.
Make sure this is safe.

571
00:51:36,231 --> 00:51:38,232
Take everything.
I'm not even looking. Go.

572
00:51:38,399 --> 00:51:42,445
Why is it everyone's got such a hard time
believing I am a good guy?

573
00:51:42,612 --> 00:51:45,323
I just saved your life.

574
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:54,374
This night just keeps getting
better and better.

575
00:52:24,946 --> 00:52:26,281
Get off my car.

576
00:52:57,479 --> 00:53:00,649
I want you to know
that I appreciate your intentions...

577
00:53:00,816 --> 00:53:03,152
...but you can't change the world
like this.

578
00:53:03,694 --> 00:53:05,988
- The road you're on is a dead end.
- Is he kidding?

579
00:53:06,155 --> 00:53:07,906
- I've tried it.
- He's lecturing.

580
00:53:08,073 --> 00:53:10,618
So I'm gonna give you one chance
to just walk away...

581
00:53:10,826 --> 00:53:13,704
...and stop this vigilante nonsense.

582
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:16,415
Okay, Leo...

583
00:53:16,582 --> 00:53:20,169
...time to teach you a lesson.

584
00:53:24,673 --> 00:53:28,510
Look, trust me when I tell you,
you don't wanna do this.

585
00:53:31,722 --> 00:53:35,018
Oh, yeah.
Well, I notice you got quite a temper.

586
00:53:37,311 --> 00:53:39,521
Hey, have you ever done this before?

587
00:53:42,483 --> 00:53:44,986
Oh, come on. You call that an attack?

588
00:53:53,536 --> 00:53:56,914
All right. Finally, some excitement.

589
00:54:08,509 --> 00:54:10,053
Funny thing about anger:

590
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:12,889
Let it consume you,
and soon enough...

591
00:54:15,892 --> 00:54:19,228
...you lose sight of everything.

592
00:54:30,323 --> 00:54:32,492
Good night, dark prince.

593
00:54:36,246 --> 00:54:37,748
Raph?

594
00:54:39,248 --> 00:54:40,375
What?

595
00:54:43,419 --> 00:54:45,756
You are so smug, you know that?

596
00:54:45,923 --> 00:54:48,258
You think the world revolves around you,
don't you?

597
00:54:48,425 --> 00:54:51,427
We couldn't survive without
the mighty and powerful Leonardo...

598
00:54:51,594 --> 00:54:53,430
...to guide us through our problems.

599
00:54:53,597 --> 00:54:57,225
Well, I got a news flash for you:
We got along just fine without you.

600
00:54:57,434 --> 00:54:59,667
Oh, and this qualifies
as "just fine"?

601
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,272
Dressing up like it's
Halloween every night?

602
00:55:02,438 --> 00:55:06,401
Risking the safety of our family?
I mean, come on, what were you thinking?

603
00:55:06,568 --> 00:55:08,862
Don't push it.
You can't leave and come back...

604
00:55:09,029 --> 00:55:11,865
...expecting us to fall in line
like your little soldiers.

605
00:55:12,032 --> 00:55:16,703
Hey, I was training.
Training to be a better leader, for you.

606
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:20,207
- Why do you hate me for that?
- And whoever said I wanted to be led?

607
00:55:20,374 --> 00:55:23,251
I'm better off calling my own shots now.
Get used to it.

608
00:55:23,418 --> 00:55:27,339
You aren't ready.
You're impatient and hot-tempered.

609
00:55:27,506 --> 00:55:31,468
And more importantly,
I'm better than you.

610
00:55:33,386 --> 00:55:35,347
Oh, you know something, big brother?

611
00:55:35,514 --> 00:55:39,017
I'd have to disagree with you
on that one.

612
00:55:41,645 --> 00:55:43,480
Don't do this, Raph.

613
00:55:44,482 --> 00:55:46,900
I'm done taking orders.

614
00:57:51,859 --> 00:57:53,278
Not human...

615
00:57:53,779 --> 00:57:58,116
...but clearly not the final monster.

616
00:57:58,866 --> 00:58:02,037
Yoatl won't know the difference.

617
00:58:02,204 --> 00:58:07,792
By the time our brother discovers
this turtle is not the 13th monster...

618
00:58:08,168 --> 00:58:11,880
...it will already be too late.

619
00:58:16,134 --> 00:58:17,761
Leo.

620
00:58:31,316 --> 00:58:34,611
Leo. Hang on.

621
00:58:37,989 --> 00:58:40,242
Leo.

622
00:58:40,701 --> 00:58:43,203
Leo.

623
00:58:53,005 --> 00:58:56,425
No!

624
00:59:15,903 --> 00:59:19,156
Raphael. What is the matter?

625
00:59:19,323 --> 00:59:21,658
I was out. I was out and I did...
I did something.

626
00:59:21,825 --> 00:59:24,787
Something happened
and then I... And I...

627
00:59:26,413 --> 00:59:29,374
Raphael. Kneel.

628
00:59:30,793 --> 00:59:32,628
I did something.

629
00:59:32,794 --> 00:59:35,131
I did something really stupid,
Master Splinter.

630
00:59:36,257 --> 00:59:37,841
Go on.

631
00:59:38,843 --> 00:59:40,844
I know why you chose him now.

632
00:59:41,011 --> 00:59:44,890
I know that there's a reason
why he's the better son and I'm not.

633
00:59:45,057 --> 00:59:51,105
Raphael, you always bear the
world's problems on your shoulders.

634
00:59:51,272 --> 00:59:57,570
It is an admirable quality when
you are a protector of others.

635
00:59:57,736 --> 01:00:03,743
But you must realize that while, at times,
you may not be my favorite student...

636
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:08,414
...it does not mean
that you are my least-favorite son.

637
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:13,669
You are strong, passionate
and loyal to a fault.

638
01:00:13,836 --> 01:00:17,840
These are the merits
of a great leader as well...

639
01:00:18,007 --> 01:00:22,220
...but only when tempered
with compassion and humility.

640
01:00:22,387 --> 01:00:25,848
But, Master Splinter,
I messed up big tonight.

641
01:00:26,015 --> 01:00:28,517
I mean big.

642
01:00:31,605 --> 01:00:33,105
They took him.

643
01:00:39,904 --> 01:00:41,656
Leonardo.

644
01:00:42,282 --> 01:00:43,866
Yeah.

645
01:00:50,832 --> 01:00:53,668
Then the time for hiding is over.

646
01:00:53,835 --> 01:00:59,507
We must return to the surface
to take back what is ours.

647
01:01:01,301 --> 01:01:04,387
By your wish, Father.

648
01:01:07,223 --> 01:01:11,477
Long have we been in hiding.
Perhaps too long.

649
01:01:11,644 --> 01:01:14,690
Well, what do we do now?

650
01:01:14,857 --> 01:01:16,608
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

651
01:01:16,775 --> 01:01:21,154
We're gonna rescue our brother,
and then we're gonna save New York City.

652
01:02:27,888 --> 01:02:30,933
I got it on my last trip to Japan.
You like it?

653
01:02:31,099 --> 01:02:33,019
Oh, yeah.

654
01:02:35,104 --> 01:02:37,315
No way.

655
01:02:39,775 --> 01:02:42,152
You can't go trick-or-treating
without your mask.

656
01:02:43,195 --> 01:02:46,198
Oh, babe. Thanks.

657
01:03:02,506 --> 01:03:05,968
As ordered,
no one gets into the tower...

658
01:03:06,135 --> 01:03:11,307
...no one interferes,
no one bears witness.

659
01:03:21,108 --> 01:03:23,361
You've got to be kidding me.

660
01:03:25,613 --> 01:03:29,700
Cowabunga, dude. I'm here
for little Maxie's 13th birthday party.

661
01:03:29,867 --> 01:03:31,202
Leave now.

662
01:03:31,369 --> 01:03:34,205
Oh, but you don't understand, lady.
I got...

663
01:04:22,337 --> 01:04:28,176
At last. After 3000 years,
the time is finally at hand.

664
01:04:48,697 --> 01:04:52,117
What...? What have you done?

665
01:04:52,993 --> 01:04:55,954
Your time for giving orders is over.

666
01:04:56,162 --> 01:04:57,539
You don't understand.

667
01:04:57,706 --> 01:04:59,708
I want to send these creatures back...

668
01:04:59,874 --> 01:05:02,544
...to undo the damage
that was done so many years ago.

669
01:05:02,711 --> 01:05:05,798
Time has done nothing
but made you weak.

670
01:05:05,964 --> 01:05:08,216
We have our own plans.

671
01:05:08,383 --> 01:05:10,594
Immortality is a curse, brother.

672
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:13,180
Trust me, I've lived long enough to know.

673
01:05:13,347 --> 01:05:16,475
We have to find that 13th monster.
It's time to end it.

674
01:05:16,642 --> 01:05:18,227
No.

675
01:05:19,561 --> 01:05:22,731
Our time is just beginning.

676
01:05:45,338 --> 01:05:47,798
- Little help, Don.
- I'm on it.

677
01:05:57,974 --> 01:05:59,935
Heads up, dudes.

678
01:06:00,102 --> 01:06:02,271
Goal.

679
01:06:05,941 --> 01:06:08,736
Guys, front door's open. Now.

680
01:06:09,112 --> 01:06:11,655
Two minutes for high sticking.

681
01:06:15,034 --> 01:06:19,079
Dudes, that rocked. Let's go again.

682
01:06:28,965 --> 01:06:32,093
- Dudes, what do we do?
- I'm working on it.

683
01:06:33,344 --> 01:06:35,221
You break it, you buy it.

684
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:42,395
Yeah. All right.

685
01:06:42,561 --> 01:06:45,189
All right. Nice.

686
01:06:45,356 --> 01:06:48,485
- Nice work, Jones.
- I have my moments.

687
01:06:48,652 --> 01:06:50,695
Whoa, check it out.

688
01:06:50,862 --> 01:06:54,448
That would be the swirling vortex
to another world, I assume.

689
01:06:54,657 --> 01:06:56,618
Cool. I want one.

690
01:06:59,746 --> 01:07:01,247
Leo, is that you?

691
01:07:03,166 --> 01:07:05,000
Sorry, wrong cage.

692
01:07:07,837 --> 01:07:10,673
- Leo. I got him.
- Out of the way, please.

693
01:07:18,014 --> 01:07:21,267
Hey, buddy. Come on, man. Up we go.

694
01:07:21,851 --> 01:07:23,728
There you go.

695
01:07:34,990 --> 01:07:38,285
You're gonna need these
if you're gonna lead us out of here.

696
01:07:39,911 --> 01:07:42,205
I'm gonna need you too.

697
01:07:48,878 --> 01:07:51,923
- Winters.
- Looks more like fall. Get it?

698
01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:53,800
Mikey, remember our talk.

699
01:07:56,719 --> 01:07:59,431
Looks like someone got to him
before us.

700
01:08:02,434 --> 01:08:03,935
Is he dead?

701
01:08:09,357 --> 01:08:11,734
Not so immortal, huh, dudes?

702
01:08:15,613 --> 01:08:18,575
Your time's run out, Winters.

703
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:20,702
Miss O'Neil.

704
01:08:20,869 --> 01:08:25,415
I must have hit my head pretty hard.
I'm seeing giant turtles.

705
01:08:25,582 --> 01:08:28,585
We know what you're up to, Winters.
We know about the portal...

706
01:08:28,752 --> 01:08:32,005
...and we think that it's time
you sent all these monsters home.

707
01:08:35,592 --> 01:08:37,428
I couldn't agree with you more.

708
01:08:37,594 --> 01:08:41,557
It is time to put an end to the curse
that I have brought upon myself...

709
01:08:41,765 --> 01:08:44,059
...and this world.

710
01:08:44,226 --> 01:08:48,605
<i>That's what this is about, Miss O'Neil:
Penance:</i>

711
01:08:48,772 --> 01:08:54,111
I must return all 13 beasts
or our curse will continue.

712
01:08:54,278 --> 01:08:58,698
And that is a torment
I can no longer bear.

713
01:08:58,865 --> 01:09:02,953
Then you should be
put out of your misery.

714
01:09:03,704 --> 01:09:07,082
I think we walked in
on a family feud, guys.

715
01:09:07,332 --> 01:09:12,171
The time has come to reopen the portal
and rain destruction upon the Earth.

716
01:09:12,338 --> 01:09:14,297
Nothing will stand in our way...

717
01:09:14,464 --> 01:09:17,468
...when we have an army
at our command.

718
01:09:17,635 --> 01:09:21,138
- My brothers, I...
- We are no brothers to you.

719
01:09:21,305 --> 01:09:27,144
With one monster still free,
the curse will never be broken.

720
01:09:27,311 --> 01:09:31,732
We shall finish what we began
all those years ago.

721
01:09:31,899 --> 01:09:34,652
And we will finally have our victory.

722
01:09:34,818 --> 01:09:37,821
Join us. Join us, Foot Clan.

723
01:09:37,988 --> 01:09:41,909
Swear your allegiance to us
and no harm will befall you.

724
01:09:43,494 --> 01:09:49,625
The Foot ninja is not without
honor. We work for Winters, not you.

725
01:09:54,171 --> 01:09:56,466
Okay, what does that mean?

726
01:09:56,633 --> 01:09:59,635
It means we're going to help you.

727
01:09:59,802 --> 01:10:04,682
My ninja will find the last monster
and you will bring it back here.

728
01:10:04,849 --> 01:10:06,601
Hurry, we don't have much time.

729
01:10:10,229 --> 01:10:12,649
Hey. I got shotgun.

730
01:10:12,816 --> 01:10:14,358
Forget about them.

731
01:10:14,525 --> 01:10:18,362
By the time they return,
the portal will already be closed...

732
01:10:18,529 --> 01:10:21,157
...with you inside it.

733
01:10:21,449 --> 01:10:23,493
I hate to see brothers fight like this.

734
01:10:23,701 --> 01:10:26,537
Unless it's together.

735
01:10:28,373 --> 01:10:32,960
Hate to rain on your parade, pal,
but we thought we'd even the odds.

736
01:10:33,127 --> 01:10:36,089
We're going to enjoy this.

737
01:10:42,053 --> 01:10:45,306
If you please. They can defeat them.

738
01:10:45,473 --> 01:10:47,809
They are a team.

739
01:10:48,226 --> 01:10:51,688
Let's hope so, because if not,
Aguila will use the portal...

740
01:10:51,855 --> 01:10:57,068
...to draw forth an army of evil
and the world will be lost.

741
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:03,033
More beasts.
Let's send them back where they belong.

742
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:10,707
Temper, temper.

743
01:11:25,263 --> 01:11:27,057
Come to daddy.

744
01:11:33,897 --> 01:11:36,566
Thing about you immortal stone guys is...

745
01:11:36,775 --> 01:11:39,445
...you know, you're immortal
and made of stone.

746
01:11:39,611 --> 01:11:41,613
I sound like Mikey.

747
01:11:42,948 --> 01:11:46,035
You fight well. You should join us.

748
01:11:46,327 --> 01:11:48,704
No, thanks, I'm good.

749
01:11:57,463 --> 01:12:00,799
These guys really don't die.
Sensei, are you all right?

750
01:12:01,967 --> 01:12:04,303
We must do this more often.

751
01:12:07,138 --> 01:12:08,932
I still got it.

752
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:14,063
They'd better hurry
with that last monster.

753
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:17,107
I'm sure my man Casey's
got it all under control.

754
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:20,527
That's what I'm afraid of.

755
01:12:26,284 --> 01:12:27,951
Can't this piece of junk go faster?

756
01:12:28,118 --> 01:12:30,163
- Wanna drive?
- I would, as a matter of fact.

757
01:12:30,329 --> 01:12:36,252
You would think they would be
more concerned about the 13th monster.

758
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:03,195
Boys, we must finish this now.

759
01:13:28,847 --> 01:13:30,348
So did we win?

760
01:13:37,605 --> 01:13:42,068
Foolish creatures.
We are immortals made of stone.

761
01:13:42,235 --> 01:13:44,988
Without the final monster
to break our curse...

762
01:13:45,155 --> 01:13:48,158
...we will never be stopped.

763
01:13:50,535 --> 01:13:52,370
Special delivery.

764
01:13:58,334 --> 01:13:59,544
Look out.

765
01:14:40,502 --> 01:14:42,754
So did we win now?

766
01:14:42,921 --> 01:14:45,674
- Yeah, I think we did.
- We won.

767
01:14:45,841 --> 01:14:47,009
- All right.
- Yeah!

768
01:14:47,176 --> 01:14:50,137
All right. That's what I'm talking about.

769
01:14:50,554 --> 01:14:51,889
Yeah!

770
01:14:52,472 --> 01:14:54,683
Nice parallel parking.

771
01:14:54,850 --> 01:14:58,145
Next time, I'm driving.

772
01:15:02,441 --> 01:15:05,110
Hey. Watch the hair.

773
01:15:09,907 --> 01:15:13,577
Typical. We do all the work,
he gets all the thanks.

774
01:15:19,041 --> 01:15:22,920
You are every bit the warriors
I was informed you were.

775
01:15:23,087 --> 01:15:24,588
You have passed.

776
01:15:24,755 --> 01:15:27,674
Savor your victory tonight.

777
01:15:27,841 --> 01:15:31,762
For soon, we will have
further business together.

778
01:15:31,929 --> 01:15:36,642
The kind that involves familiar faces
from your past.

779
01:15:37,810 --> 01:15:39,895
She doesn't mean...

780
01:15:44,984 --> 01:15:49,155
Come on. What is it with ninjas
and smoke pellets?

781
01:15:55,369 --> 01:15:57,663
Looks like you picked a good time
to come home.

782
01:15:57,830 --> 01:16:01,626
Thanks for bringing me back.

783
01:16:06,631 --> 01:16:08,132
Winters?

784
01:16:13,012 --> 01:16:15,681
I'm never usually that happy
to be in pain.

785
01:16:15,890 --> 01:16:18,851
He's happy because he's mortal again,
Mikey.

786
01:16:19,059 --> 01:16:22,272
April. I've had my eye on you
for a long time.

787
01:16:22,438 --> 01:16:23,898
I knew it.

788
01:16:24,065 --> 01:16:29,904
I've always known that you'd be the one
to help me find my way home.

789
01:16:31,197 --> 01:16:32,866
And thank you...

790
01:16:33,241 --> 01:16:34,950
...brothers.

791
01:16:35,117 --> 01:16:41,458
You've made a very old
man very, very happy.

792
01:16:42,458 --> 01:16:45,754
So, what happens now?

793
01:17:30,006 --> 01:17:34,260
Okay. Just a little bit creepy.

794
01:17:35,136 --> 01:17:40,601
Oh, gross. I think he's in my no...
My no... My no...

795
01:17:43,311 --> 01:17:45,981
Gross. Somebody give me a hankie.

796
01:17:47,649 --> 01:17:49,901
Now he's in my mouth.

797
01:17:50,068 --> 01:17:52,488
Tastes awful.

798
01:18:22,643 --> 01:18:25,062
You got room for one more?

799
01:18:42,413 --> 01:18:45,374
Can I get rid of this too?

800
01:19:02,266 --> 01:19:04,643
<i>We live together. We train together.</i>

801
01:19:04,810 --> 01:19:08,355
<i>We fight together.
We stand for good, together.</i>

802
01:19:08,522 --> 01:19:10,525
<i>We are ninjas.</i>

803
01:19:10,692 --> 01:19:16,030
<i>We strike hard, defend, protect,
and fade into the night.</i>

804
01:19:16,196 --> 01:19:19,366
<i>And there ain't no bad guy or monster
gonna ever change that.</i>

805
01:19:19,533 --> 01:19:21,285
<i>That's what's important.</i>

806
01:19:21,452 --> 01:19:25,289
<i>And that's why
we'll always be brothers.</i>

807
01:19:26,875 --> 01:19:29,627
<i>Oh, I love being a turtle.</i>
