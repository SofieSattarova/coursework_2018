1
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:03,206
America is an irradiated wasteland.

2
00:01:04,957 --> 00:01:06,918
Within it lies a city.

3
00:01:08,878 --> 00:01:12,006
Outside the boundary walls a desert.

4
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,800
A cursed earth.

5
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:18,805
Inside the walls a cursed city,

6
00:01:18,888 --> 00:01:22,266
stretching from Boston to Washington, D.C.

7
00:01:23,393 --> 00:01:26,062
An unbroken concrete landscape.

8
00:01:27,814 --> 00:01:29,232
800 million people

9
00:01:29,315 --> 00:01:32,276
living in the ruin of the old world

10
00:01:32,944 --> 00:01:35,613
and the mega structures of the new one.

11
00:01:37,907 --> 00:01:41,244
Mega blocks. Mega highways.

12
00:01:42,662 --> 00:01:44,580
Mega City One.

13
00:01:53,339 --> 00:01:56,426
Convulsing. Choking.

14
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:01,472
Breaking under its own weight.

15
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:08,271
Citizens in fear of the street.

16
00:02:08,813 --> 00:02:12,483
The gun. The gang.

17
00:02:16,863 --> 00:02:20,199
Only one thing fighting
for order in the chaos,

18
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:24,287
the men and women of the Hall of Justice.

19
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:29,959
Juries.

20
00:02:32,128 --> 00:02:33,671
Executioners.

21
00:02:36,382 --> 00:02:37,508
Judges.

22
00:02:46,809 --> 00:02:50,146
Responders needed
at a square at 1117.

23
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:51,314
Code 10-10.

24
00:02:51,397 --> 00:02:52,482
Leisure complex.

25
00:02:52,565 --> 00:02:53,608
Shots fired.

26
00:02:53,691 --> 00:02:55,067
Out of vehicle, in pursuit.

27
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:56,611
Request aerial surveillance.

28
00:02:56,694 --> 00:02:57,737
I have a control drone

29
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,906
flagging three perps.

30
00:03:00,323 --> 00:03:03,326
Responders needed
in Sub-Sector 20, Flyover 5.

31
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:05,745
We have a positive ID on three suspects

32
00:03:05,828 --> 00:03:06,996
wanted on multiple counts.

33
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:08,664
Any Judges, please respond.

34
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:14,921
Dredd to Control.
In pursuit of vehicle, Sector 13.

35
00:03:16,756 --> 00:03:17,840
Driving erratic.

36
00:03:17,924 --> 00:03:20,760
Suspects are under the
influence of narcotics.

37
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:48,120
Got a Judge on our tail.

38
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:50,790
What?

39
00:03:50,957 --> 00:03:52,708
I said, we got a Judge on our tail!

40
00:03:52,792 --> 00:03:55,127
Take him out or we're dead fucking meat!

41
00:03:57,755 --> 00:03:58,798
Fuck!

42
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:01,801
Do you require backup?

43
00:04:02,093 --> 00:04:03,094
No.

44
00:04:06,305 --> 00:04:07,807
Fucker!

45
00:04:13,312 --> 00:04:15,815
I can't get him! Straighten the fuck out!

46
00:04:30,162 --> 00:04:31,247
Be advised.

47
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,415
We have lost visual.

48
00:04:37,795 --> 00:04:39,964
Fuck, he's right on us!

49
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:43,634
Oh, man, we're dead. We're fucking dead!

50
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:57,607
Control. Perps just wiped out an innocent.

51
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,609
I'm taking them down.

52
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:21,172
Bike. Activate crowd control.

53
00:05:21,297 --> 00:05:23,883
Activated.
Citizens, be calm.

54
00:05:23,966 --> 00:05:25,801
Step back from the crime scene.

55
00:05:25,885 --> 00:05:29,639
Interference carries
an automatic five-year sentence

56
00:05:29,722 --> 00:05:30,890
in the iso-cubes.

57
00:05:41,192 --> 00:05:43,235
Hey, fucking get out of here!

58
00:06:03,422 --> 00:06:06,008
Control. Paramedics to my GPS.

59
00:06:06,092 --> 00:06:08,094
Multiple wounded and bodies for Resyk.

60
00:06:08,427 --> 00:06:10,096
Copy, Dredd.

61
00:06:11,764 --> 00:06:13,015
All shoppers are reminded

62
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:15,935
to avoid the level 1 food courts
until further notice.

63
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,853
Alternative refreshments can be found...

64
00:06:17,937 --> 00:06:20,022
Shut the fuck up.

65
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,710
- Let's talk.
- Talk about what, Judge?

66
00:06:42,294 --> 00:06:44,714
Release the hostage unharmed,

67
00:06:44,797 --> 00:06:46,716
and I guarantee you a sentence of life

68
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:49,468
in an iso-cube without parole.

69
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:51,470
Life without parole?

70
00:06:51,595 --> 00:06:52,875
That's the deal you're offering?

71
00:06:52,888 --> 00:06:54,640
Only if you comply.

72
00:06:55,141 --> 00:06:57,476
Your crimes include multiple homicide

73
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,979
and the attempted murder of a judge.

74
00:07:00,146 --> 00:07:03,983
If you do not comply,
the sentence is death.

75
00:07:04,316 --> 00:07:06,485
You aren't a very good negotiator, Judge.

76
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:08,821
You know why?
You got no fucking leverage!

77
00:07:08,904 --> 00:07:10,740
- Here's the deal.

78
00:07:10,823 --> 00:07:13,617
You let me walk or I blow
her fucking brains out. Okay?

79
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,289
Negotiation's over.

80
00:07:18,414 --> 00:07:19,832
What are you doing?

81
00:07:19,915 --> 00:07:21,835
Didn't you hear what I said?
I'll kill the bitch!

82
00:07:22,793 --> 00:07:24,587
Yeah, I heard you, hotshot.

83
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,671
What?

84
00:07:25,755 --> 00:07:27,757
I said "hotshot."

85
00:07:51,989 --> 00:07:53,991
Control to Dredd. Come in.

86
00:07:54,492 --> 00:07:57,369
- Is your pursuit resolved?
- Affirmative.

87
00:07:57,453 --> 00:07:59,121
Report back to the Hall of Justice.

88
00:07:59,205 --> 00:08:01,165
The Chief Judge wants to see you.

89
00:08:04,543 --> 00:08:06,170
Thank you, Judge.

90
00:08:07,463 --> 00:08:08,631
The level 1 food court

91
00:08:08,714 --> 00:08:11,759
will reopen in 30 minutes.
Thank you for your patience.

92
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:29,485
Cassandra Anderson.
Twenty-one.

93
00:08:30,194 --> 00:08:33,906
Born in a block 100 meters
from the radiation boundary wall.

94
00:08:34,031 --> 00:08:35,825
At age seven, she lost both parents

95
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:38,118
to residual-fallout cancer.

96
00:08:38,202 --> 00:08:39,662
As is usual with orphans,

97
00:08:39,745 --> 00:08:42,998
she was given a Judge aptitude test
at age nine.

98
00:08:43,082 --> 00:08:45,000
It classified her as unsuitable,

99
00:08:45,084 --> 00:08:46,669
but she was entered into the Academy

100
00:08:46,752 --> 00:08:48,420
on special instruction.

101
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:52,383
In the Academy, her record was never
better than borderline.

102
00:08:52,508 --> 00:08:53,968
Her final Academy score

103
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:56,554
put her three percentile
points below a pass.

104
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,430
So what's she doing in a uniform?

105
00:09:04,395 --> 00:09:06,146
- Rookie Anderson.
- Sir.

106
00:09:06,272 --> 00:09:08,148
How many people are observing you?

107
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:12,695
Two.

108
00:09:13,112 --> 00:09:15,781
What can you tell me
about the person I'm with?

109
00:09:17,116 --> 00:09:20,119
Male. Another Judge.

110
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:27,167
I can feel anger. And control. But

111
00:09:28,794 --> 00:09:30,462
there's something else.

112
00:09:30,796 --> 00:09:34,300
Something behind the control. Something

113
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:38,262
almost...
- Okay, Anderson.

114
00:09:38,971 --> 00:09:40,306
That Will do.

115
00:09:40,973 --> 00:09:42,474
She's a mutant.

116
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,644
The Judges Council have chosen
to overlook her status.

117
00:09:45,978 --> 00:09:47,146
So you will, too.

118
00:09:47,897 --> 00:09:49,607
She's the most powerful psychic

119
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,901
we've ever come across by a huge margin.

120
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:55,154
The Judges are losing the war for the city.

121
00:09:55,237 --> 00:09:57,156
We believe she could be a major asset.

122
00:09:57,823 --> 00:10:01,118
As I said, her final score
was only three points below a pass.

123
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,411
It's marginal.

124
00:10:02,494 --> 00:10:04,538
It's not marginal. She failed.

125
00:10:04,622 --> 00:10:06,415
The girl's getting one more chance.

126
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,920
I want you to take her out,
give her one day in the field.

127
00:10:11,003 --> 00:10:12,338
Supervised.

128
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,173
See if she makes the grade.

129
00:10:14,924 --> 00:10:18,135
Sink or swim. Chuck her in the deep end.

130
00:10:20,596 --> 00:10:22,431
It's all the deep end.

131
00:10:24,266 --> 00:10:25,601
Personnel are required

132
00:10:25,684 --> 00:10:27,311
to carry identification at all times.

133
00:10:27,436 --> 00:10:28,604
A rookie judge on assessment

134
00:10:28,687 --> 00:10:30,522
is likely to be involved in armed combat.

135
00:10:30,606 --> 00:10:32,524
One in five don't survive the first day.

136
00:10:32,691 --> 00:10:34,401
You may be required to carry out

137
00:10:34,485 --> 00:10:36,278
on-the-spot executions of convicted felons.

138
00:10:36,362 --> 00:10:37,404
Yes, sir.

139
00:10:37,488 --> 00:10:40,366
Incorrect sentencing is an automatic fail.

140
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:42,868
Disobeying a direct order
from your assessment officer

141
00:10:42,952 --> 00:10:44,620
is an automatic fail.

142
00:10:45,037 --> 00:10:48,832
Losing your primary weapon or having it
taken from you is an automatic fail.

143
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:49,959
Yes, sir.

144
00:10:50,042 --> 00:10:51,710
Are you ready, rookie?

145
00:10:51,794 --> 00:10:53,212
I am.

146
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:55,130
Mandatory vehicle checks...

147
00:10:55,214 --> 00:10:56,632
Your assessment starts now.

148
00:12:23,218 --> 00:12:24,470
Ma.

149
00:12:34,063 --> 00:12:35,731
We got trouble.

150
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:44,323
They were selling Sternhammer product
on my level.

151
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,076
I warned them off with a beating
a couple of weeks ago.

152
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,327
Guess it didn't work.

153
00:12:48,619 --> 00:12:50,162
You can't deal with it yourself?

154
00:12:50,621 --> 00:12:52,122
I can deal with it.

155
00:12:52,414 --> 00:12:54,695
The question is whether you
wanna make an example of them.

156
00:12:58,837 --> 00:13:01,965
Skin them. Toss them over the balcony.

157
00:13:02,508 --> 00:13:04,384
Hit them with a little slo-mo first?

158
00:13:05,803 --> 00:13:06,845
Sure.

159
00:13:14,186 --> 00:13:15,604
- Eat this, fucker!

160
00:13:16,021 --> 00:13:17,356
Hold him down!

161
00:13:18,315 --> 00:13:20,317
Please. Oh, please.

162
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:06,488
Responders in
the vicinity of Peach Trees.

163
00:14:06,572 --> 00:14:08,615
We have a report of a triple homicide.

164
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:12,452
The paramedic is on site
and is cordoning off the area.

165
00:14:20,377 --> 00:14:23,172
12 serious crimes
reported every minute.

166
00:14:23,255 --> 00:14:24,673
17,000 per day.

167
00:14:25,257 --> 00:14:27,176
We can respond to around 6%.

168
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:28,260
Which 6%?

169
00:14:29,094 --> 00:14:31,263
Your show, rookie.
You tell me.

170
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,892
Peach Trees.
Multiple homicide.

171
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,269
Dredd to Control.
We'll take Peach Trees.

172
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:39,229
Copy that.

173
00:15:02,586 --> 00:15:04,546
Hey, Joey,
show us what you've got.

174
00:15:09,593 --> 00:15:10,636
Okay, rookie.

175
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:12,304
What do you know
about Peach Trees?

176
00:15:12,387 --> 00:15:15,599
Sir. Peach Trees houses
75,000 registered citizens.

177
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:17,726
It has the highest
crime rate in Sector 13.

178
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:19,853
Unemployment rate of 96%.

179
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:21,778
And more than half the
residential levels here

180
00:15:21,813 --> 00:15:23,106
are classed as slums.

181
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,237
Rookie.

182
00:15:29,738 --> 00:15:30,739
Judgment.

183
00:15:30,822 --> 00:15:32,741
Vagrancy, three weeks, iso-cubes.

184
00:15:32,824 --> 00:15:34,243
But prioritize murders?

185
00:15:34,326 --> 00:15:37,162
Correct. Don't be here when we get back.

186
00:15:37,246 --> 00:15:38,872
Yes. Thanks, Judge.

187
00:15:40,832 --> 00:15:43,502
Please remain behind the security tape.

188
00:15:44,586 --> 00:15:46,588
So why do you wanna be a judge?

189
00:15:46,672 --> 00:15:49,383
Sir. I want to protect and serve the city.

190
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:50,926
To make a difference.

191
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:53,178
Make a difference to a block like this?

192
00:15:53,804 --> 00:15:55,681
It's yours if you want it.

193
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:58,183
I was born and raised in a block like this

194
00:15:58,267 --> 00:16:00,227
before the Justice Department took me.

195
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,271
I know there are good people inside,

196
00:16:02,354 --> 00:16:05,315
good families just trying to get by.

197
00:16:06,775 --> 00:16:09,069
Yes, I believe I can make a difference.

198
00:16:11,196 --> 00:16:12,531
Admirable.

199
00:16:13,824 --> 00:16:15,784
The mall will be closing today at 10:00.

200
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:17,911
Plenty of time
to make your purchases.

201
00:16:20,831 --> 00:16:21,873
What have you got?

202
00:16:21,957 --> 00:16:24,876
Three stiffs
in a somewhat fucked-up condition.

203
00:16:25,836 --> 00:16:28,130
Oh, did you get a picture of that?

204
00:16:28,213 --> 00:16:29,464
You based in Peach Trees?

205
00:16:29,548 --> 00:16:31,341
Med Center, level 25.

206
00:16:31,466 --> 00:16:33,093
- You ID'd them?
- Mostly.

207
00:16:33,176 --> 00:16:34,803
These two are registered to this block.

208
00:16:34,886 --> 00:16:35,929
And him?

209
00:16:36,013 --> 00:16:38,307
I'll have to run his blood
through a DNA profiler.

210
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,392
If I can figure out which blood is his.

211
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,720
What do you make of this, rookie?

212
00:16:50,861 --> 00:16:52,070
I don't know, sir.

213
00:16:57,659 --> 00:16:59,661
It's a cold-burn from a slo-mo inhaler.

214
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:01,455
Slo-mo?

215
00:17:01,872 --> 00:17:05,125
Only just hit the grid,
but it's making big waves.

216
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,418
Makes the brain feel as if

217
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:09,004
time is passing at 1% its normal speed.

218
00:17:10,756 --> 00:17:13,008
Guess it felt like a long way down.

219
00:17:27,397 --> 00:17:28,982
Positive on your IDs.

220
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:32,194
All showing convictions for
possession of narcotics.

221
00:17:32,903 --> 00:17:34,029
Transmitting data now.

222
00:17:35,906 --> 00:17:38,950
Small-time perps. Junkies.
No known gang affiliation.

223
00:17:39,034 --> 00:17:40,285
What's your analysis?

224
00:17:42,245 --> 00:17:44,623
Drugged. Skinned.
Displayed in public.

225
00:17:45,123 --> 00:17:47,042
I think it's a punishment killing.

226
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,044
Someone's trying to send a message.

227
00:17:49,127 --> 00:17:52,297
Yeah. Don't fuck with the Ma-Ma Clan.

228
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:55,133
Ma-Ma Clan?

229
00:17:59,137 --> 00:18:01,890
We have her
on record from her whoring days.

230
00:18:01,973 --> 00:18:03,850
The picture's pretty old

231
00:18:03,934 --> 00:18:08,480
but that's her.
Madeline Madrigal, aka Ma-Ma.

232
00:18:09,147 --> 00:18:11,691
Ex-hooker from the S-9 pleasure district.

233
00:18:12,484 --> 00:18:14,986
Quit working when she got
sliced up by her pimp.

234
00:18:15,278 --> 00:18:16,655
She got her own back.

235
00:18:17,114 --> 00:18:19,741
Block legend says
she feminized the guy with her teeth.

236
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:24,162
Took over his business interests
and never looked back.

237
00:18:24,913 --> 00:18:27,165
Anyone else, you'd say
it was bullshit, right?

238
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:31,336
Not with Ma-Ma.
Her trademark is violence.

239
00:18:35,632 --> 00:18:38,260
Not so long ago
there were three main gangs

240
00:18:38,343 --> 00:18:40,512
hustling for control of Peach Trees.

241
00:18:41,138 --> 00:18:44,850
The Peyote Kings,
the Red Dragons, the Judged.

242
00:18:45,642 --> 00:18:47,018
Then Ma-Ma arrived.

243
00:18:53,483 --> 00:18:54,526
What the fuck?

244
00:18:56,528 --> 00:18:57,779
Let's go!

245
00:18:59,448 --> 00:19:01,049
Took over the top floor of the block

246
00:19:01,116 --> 00:19:02,868
and started working her way down.

247
00:19:04,703 --> 00:19:08,039
Nine months later,
she had control of everything.

248
00:19:08,206 --> 00:19:10,459
Levels 1 to 200

249
00:19:11,293 --> 00:19:12,627
are hers.

250
00:19:13,545 --> 00:19:14,880
How did she get away with it?

251
00:19:14,963 --> 00:19:18,216
You know how often we get
a judge up in Peach Trees?

252
00:19:19,134 --> 00:19:20,760
Well, you got one now.

253
00:19:22,053 --> 00:19:25,557
The victims are registered
to apartments on level 39.

254
00:19:25,891 --> 00:19:27,601
Likely killed over a turf issue,

255
00:19:27,851 --> 00:19:29,811
so perps will be in the vicinity.

256
00:19:31,563 --> 00:19:32,856
Rookie.

257
00:19:33,356 --> 00:19:36,568
Find out where the Clan
operate on this level, and hit it hard.

258
00:19:40,322 --> 00:19:41,740
That would be here.

259
00:20:50,976 --> 00:20:53,228
Take it this is
your first time in non-sim combat.

260
00:20:53,311 --> 00:20:54,729
Yes, sir.

261
00:20:54,813 --> 00:20:56,481
Been wondering when you'd remember

262
00:20:56,565 --> 00:20:58,108
you left your helmet behind.

263
00:20:58,233 --> 00:21:01,194
Sir, a helmet can interfere
with my psychic abilities.

264
00:21:02,612 --> 00:21:04,948
Think a bullet might
interfere with them more.

265
00:21:16,585 --> 00:21:17,794
Are you ready?

266
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:19,004
Yes, sir.

267
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:22,257
You don't look ready.

268
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,009
Just adrenaline, sir.

269
00:22:42,504 --> 00:22:43,588
Rookie.

270
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,966
Anderson. Judgment.

271
00:22:47,926 --> 00:22:50,261
Crime, possession and use
of controlled substances.

272
00:22:50,345 --> 00:22:52,430
Sentence: two years iso-cubes.

273
00:22:53,431 --> 00:22:55,350
No, don't tell me. Tell Control.

274
00:22:57,227 --> 00:22:58,353
Anderson to Control.

275
00:22:58,436 --> 00:22:59,479
Copy.

276
00:22:59,562 --> 00:23:01,856
Requesting meat wagon to
Peach Trees, level 39.

277
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,149
We have

278
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:06,820
four bodies for Resyk
and eight live for the iso-cubes.

279
00:23:06,903 --> 00:23:08,905
Copy that. Meat wagon inbound.

280
00:23:09,614 --> 00:23:11,449
All right. Let's get them cuffed.

281
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:12,992
Move. Up.

282
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:22,502
Sir, this one's a gang member. He...

283
00:23:29,592 --> 00:23:31,177
Sir, it's him.

284
00:23:31,261 --> 00:23:32,887
Him who?

285
00:23:32,971 --> 00:23:34,772
The man who murdered
the people in the atrium.

286
00:23:36,808 --> 00:23:37,809
You're sure?

287
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,021
99%.

288
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,777
Can't execute a perp on 99%.

289
00:23:52,323 --> 00:23:56,035
Save me a lot of paperwork
if you just confess right now.

290
00:23:59,497 --> 00:24:01,624
We'll take him in.

291
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:04,586
See how he holds up
after a few hours of interrogation.

292
00:24:31,321 --> 00:24:32,530
Oh, shit.

293
00:24:34,324 --> 00:24:36,993
Judges. No, no, no...

294
00:24:39,496 --> 00:24:43,208
Uh, Caleb?
There's a problem on level 39.

295
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:46,021
Judges hit the distribution point
and shot the place up.

296
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:47,587
Took out a few of the boys.

297
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,380
So what? We're overdue a bust.

298
00:24:49,547 --> 00:24:50,799
It's just the judges showing their faces,

299
00:24:50,882 --> 00:24:52,383
reminding the citizens they exist.

300
00:24:52,467 --> 00:24:54,344
No, Ma. They picked up Kay.

301
00:24:54,427 --> 00:24:55,470
Executed?

302
00:24:55,553 --> 00:24:57,847
Interrogation.
They're taking him in right now.

303
00:24:57,931 --> 00:24:58,932
Fuck.

304
00:24:59,474 --> 00:25:00,558
If Kay talks...

305
00:25:00,725 --> 00:25:03,019
If they're taking him in, he'll talk.

306
00:25:05,647 --> 00:25:06,898
What are we gonna do?

307
00:25:38,596 --> 00:25:40,431
That one's still breathing.

308
00:25:43,601 --> 00:25:45,061
Control room is secure.

309
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,779
Router's in. You're good to go.

310
00:25:57,949 --> 00:25:59,409
Sector Control.

311
00:26:00,451 --> 00:26:02,537
Sector Control. This is
Peach Tree's control.

312
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,205
I just wanna check you were notified about

313
00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:06,291
the def-con systems test today.

314
00:26:06,374 --> 00:26:07,876
Copy that.

315
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:09,961
Peach Trees, we don't have
you down for a def-con test.

316
00:26:10,044 --> 00:26:11,713
Yeah, we must be. If you check the...

317
00:26:11,796 --> 00:26:13,131
I've got nothing.

318
00:26:16,134 --> 00:26:17,927
God fucking damn it, Sector!

319
00:26:18,011 --> 00:26:21,347
I put in the notification
myself three fucking times!

320
00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:22,891
We are good to go right now!

321
00:26:22,974 --> 00:26:26,394
I've got my supervisor
breathing down my neck.

322
00:26:26,477 --> 00:26:28,813
Hold fire, Peach Trees.
Let me get on this.

323
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,691
Okay. I put you on the system.

324
00:26:31,774 --> 00:26:33,818
Hall of Justice and all emergency services

325
00:26:33,902 --> 00:26:35,570
are notified to ignore your status.

326
00:26:35,653 --> 00:26:37,822
You can run the test any time you like.

327
00:26:37,989 --> 00:26:39,532
Appreciate that, Sector.

328
00:26:39,782 --> 00:26:41,826
You just saved my ass over here.

329
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,661
You're welcome, Peach Trees.

330
00:26:53,504 --> 00:26:56,132
Sir, he's thinking about
making a move for your gun.

331
00:26:56,841 --> 00:26:58,009
Yeah.

332
00:26:59,177 --> 00:27:01,137
He just changed his mind.

333
00:27:01,638 --> 00:27:02,639
Yeah.

334
00:27:07,602 --> 00:27:09,270
Then enter the pass key

335
00:27:09,354 --> 00:27:10,813
and you should be inside.

336
00:27:13,358 --> 00:27:15,360
Security protocols accessed.

337
00:27:16,861 --> 00:27:18,655
War protocol accessed.

338
00:27:20,198 --> 00:27:21,991
Blast shield initiated.

339
00:27:27,664 --> 00:27:30,208
Warned you. Get up.
You're headed for the cubes.

340
00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:31,811
Stand clear of doors.

341
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,507
All residents remain calm.

342
00:27:39,884 --> 00:27:41,970
All residents remain calm.

343
00:27:43,888 --> 00:27:45,598
All residents remain calm.

344
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:19,590
What's going on?

345
00:28:28,516 --> 00:28:30,435
Lockdown complete.

346
00:28:43,239 --> 00:28:44,907
You're patched in.

347
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:02,050
Peach Trees.

348
00:29:03,134 --> 00:29:04,469
This is Ma-Ma.

349
00:29:08,222 --> 00:29:10,725
Somewhere in this block are two judges.

350
00:29:13,311 --> 00:29:14,687
I want them dead.

351
00:29:16,773 --> 00:29:19,317
Until I get what I want,
the block is locked down.

352
00:29:21,819 --> 00:29:25,698
All Clan, every level,
hunt the judges down.

353
00:29:27,408 --> 00:29:29,243
Everyone else, clear the corridors

354
00:29:29,327 --> 00:29:31,913
and stay the fuck out of our way
until the shooting stops.

355
00:29:35,666 --> 00:29:37,376
If I hear of anyone helping the judges,

356
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,671
I will kill them and the next
generation of their family.

357
00:29:47,512 --> 00:29:49,430
As for the judges...

358
00:29:49,514 --> 00:29:51,265
We better move.

359
00:29:51,349 --> 00:29:53,684
...sit tight, or run.

360
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,690
Makes no difference. You're mine.

361
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:20,294
Control, we have a situation

362
00:30:20,378 --> 00:30:22,380
developing in Peach Trees.
Do you copy?

363
00:30:24,382 --> 00:30:25,967
Control, do you copy?

364
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,760
My comms are down too.

365
00:30:27,844 --> 00:30:29,720
Shielding must be blocking
our transmissions.

366
00:30:30,721 --> 00:30:32,473
We'll head for the Med Center.

367
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,896
They're here!

368
00:30:40,481 --> 00:30:41,774
- Call it.
- Sir?

369
00:30:41,858 --> 00:30:43,693
You're on assessment, Rookie. Call it.

370
00:30:45,069 --> 00:30:46,654
Multiple armed targets.
Obstructed line of sight.

371
00:30:46,737 --> 00:30:48,239
- Gas grenades.
- Respirators.

372
00:30:50,324 --> 00:30:51,826
Advise you hold your breath.

373
00:31:51,385 --> 00:31:54,555
I want the North and East
corridor totally covered.

374
00:31:54,639 --> 00:31:56,390
Sal's got the West and the South.

375
00:31:56,807 --> 00:31:58,309
And spread out your hardware.

376
00:31:58,893 --> 00:32:01,646
We're gonna hand these judges
back to Ma-Ma on a plate.

377
00:32:06,317 --> 00:32:08,236
Stay fucking focused.

378
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:10,321
Judges got it coming!

379
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:23,603
Judge, come and get me.

380
00:32:23,668 --> 00:32:25,795
We're gonna have to go through them.

381
00:32:27,171 --> 00:32:28,756
Stun grenade.

382
00:32:32,802 --> 00:32:34,762
Kill that motherfucker.

383
00:32:34,845 --> 00:32:36,555
Let's give them the good news.

384
00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:44,272
Man up that corridor, man.

385
00:32:44,355 --> 00:32:45,564
Fuck up the judges.

386
00:32:45,648 --> 00:32:46,941
Fuck them.

387
00:32:47,024 --> 00:32:50,695
Citizens of Peach Trees. This is the law.

388
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,697
Who do you think you are
coming up in here?

389
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,490
Disperse immediately,

390
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:57,410
or we will use lethal
force to clear the area.

391
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:58,703
Where's that coming from?

392
00:32:58,953 --> 00:33:00,997
Over there. Access corridor.

393
00:33:01,622 --> 00:33:03,708
You have been warned.

394
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:07,545
You now have 20 seconds to comply.

395
00:33:07,962 --> 00:33:09,922
It's you doing the complying, Judge.

396
00:33:10,381 --> 00:33:12,633
There's 10 of us, only two of you.

397
00:33:13,551 --> 00:33:15,553
Why don't you step out
from behind that doorway

398
00:33:15,678 --> 00:33:17,054
or we're gonna blow the fuck out of you.

399
00:33:17,179 --> 00:33:18,848
Ten seconds to comply.

400
00:33:19,181 --> 00:33:21,392
- Fuck you, Judge.
- You got five.

401
00:33:22,226 --> 00:33:23,686
Thanks for the heads-up.

402
00:33:43,581 --> 00:33:44,707
Please.

403
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:47,668
What are you waiting for, rookie?

404
00:33:48,044 --> 00:33:50,171
His crime is attempted murder of a Judge.

405
00:33:50,254 --> 00:33:51,964
His sentence is death.

406
00:33:54,258 --> 00:33:55,426
Yes, sir.

407
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:23,454
Open up.

408
00:34:24,622 --> 00:34:25,748
Open Up!

409
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:28,292
Negative, Judge.

410
00:34:28,459 --> 00:34:30,169
You know what's going on out here.

411
00:34:30,378 --> 00:34:31,837
We need a place we can defend.

412
00:34:31,921 --> 00:34:33,589
Then you better find someplace else.

413
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:35,800
This is a medical facility. Neutral ground.

414
00:34:35,966 --> 00:34:39,470
Neutral? You're not neutral.
You're choosing sides.

415
00:34:39,804 --> 00:34:41,484
Peach Trees has been sealed by blast doors

416
00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:43,099
designed to withstand attack.

417
00:34:43,182 --> 00:34:45,393
No one's getting out. No one's coming in.

418
00:34:45,893 --> 00:34:48,979
And you have every clan affiliate
in the block after your blood.

419
00:34:49,939 --> 00:34:53,067
There are no sides. You're already dead.

420
00:35:13,671 --> 00:35:16,340
Looks like
the Med Center's closed early today.

421
00:35:16,841 --> 00:35:18,509
Switch weapon to silencer mode.

422
00:35:18,843 --> 00:35:20,845
Our best bet now is to go covert.

423
00:35:21,345 --> 00:35:22,847
Conserve ammunition.

424
00:35:23,347 --> 00:35:25,182
And don't shoot unless you're gonna hit.

425
00:35:27,768 --> 00:35:29,311
Sir, what about the prisoner?

426
00:35:29,937 --> 00:35:30,938
Explain.

427
00:35:31,355 --> 00:35:33,774
Under the circumstances,
he could be a liability.

428
00:35:34,108 --> 00:35:36,193
Also a prime suspect in three homicides.

429
00:35:38,529 --> 00:35:41,699
What do you say, rookie?
Wanna out him loose?

430
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,034
No, sir.

431
00:35:56,505 --> 00:35:57,840
Get up!

432
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,945
Go, go, go, go!

433
00:36:39,173 --> 00:36:40,299
Hold up.

434
00:36:55,105 --> 00:36:56,190
Move!

435
00:36:56,273 --> 00:36:58,108
Keep your eyes peeled.

436
00:36:58,192 --> 00:37:00,353
Man, stop telling me what to fucking do!

437
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,123
I know that new shit...

438
00:37:20,673 --> 00:37:21,799
Cathy?

439
00:37:22,675 --> 00:37:24,760
- Who's there?
- Cathy, open the door.

440
00:37:32,142 --> 00:37:33,644
We're not gonna hurt you.

441
00:37:48,617 --> 00:37:49,618
Clear.

442
00:37:50,828 --> 00:37:52,948
Secure the woman somewhere
she can't raise any alarms.

443
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,457
We can't.

444
00:37:56,584 --> 00:38:00,087
She has a baby. Asleep in the next room.

445
00:38:01,005 --> 00:38:03,007
We can't secure her if we don't know
when she'll be freed.

446
00:38:03,257 --> 00:38:04,758
Is there a father?

447
00:38:05,301 --> 00:38:07,553
He's out there. Looking for us.

448
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,099
Say that. What you were just thinking.

449
00:38:12,641 --> 00:38:14,184
How did you...

450
00:38:14,268 --> 00:38:15,728
It's okay. Go ahead.

451
00:38:19,023 --> 00:38:21,025
I'm not raising any alarms.

452
00:38:21,525 --> 00:38:24,945
If the men out there don't know where
you are, you won't be killing them.

453
00:38:25,029 --> 00:38:26,030
Go on.

454
00:38:27,615 --> 00:38:29,533
There's a service elevator near here.

455
00:38:30,451 --> 00:38:32,703
The sign says it's broken, but

456
00:38:36,248 --> 00:38:39,376
it works as long as you're hitting
a button above level 75.

457
00:38:40,377 --> 00:38:43,505
I just want you off my level.
Away from my family.

458
00:39:16,038 --> 00:39:17,456
- Cathy, I...
- Don't thank me.

459
00:39:18,374 --> 00:39:22,169
It's not for you.
I just don't wanna see you again.

460
00:39:26,382 --> 00:39:27,549
You won't.

461
00:39:57,538 --> 00:40:00,374
This drug shifts like
nothing I've ever seen.

462
00:40:00,457 --> 00:40:03,293
If we play this right,
we could take the whole fucking city.

463
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:06,422
The only danger is we expand too fast.

464
00:40:07,631 --> 00:40:10,592
In the last few days, we've added
distribution to three new blocks.

465
00:40:10,676 --> 00:40:14,763
And pretty soon, we're looking at
making inroads into Sectors 9 and 15.

466
00:40:14,847 --> 00:40:16,974
Fifteen is still Red territory.

467
00:40:19,101 --> 00:40:20,602
Ma, you better come quick.

468
00:40:22,312 --> 00:40:24,398
Okay. We got one here,

469
00:40:24,481 --> 00:40:27,067
maybe 11 outside the Med Center.

470
00:40:27,151 --> 00:40:30,487
There's eight in the stairwell
and another five on level 18.

471
00:40:30,571 --> 00:40:33,824
They've downed 30 plus
and haven't even taken a scratch.

472
00:40:34,491 --> 00:40:35,617
Where are they now?

473
00:40:35,701 --> 00:40:38,221
I don't know, but they seem
to be moving their way up the block.

474
00:40:38,537 --> 00:40:40,247
No, wait, wait. I just picked them up.

475
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,499
They're on level 76, West Quadrant.

476
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:44,343
Do you want me to patch you back
into the PA?

477
00:40:44,418 --> 00:40:47,254
We could get level 60 through 80
converging on them.

478
00:40:47,337 --> 00:40:49,840
No. Can you seal them in there?

479
00:40:49,923 --> 00:40:52,926
Sure. War override gives me
total control of the building.

480
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:16,325
That's not good.

481
00:41:16,867 --> 00:41:18,660
Full lockdown. They're going nowhere.

482
00:41:20,871 --> 00:41:23,791
I tried to do this clean, but they wouldn't
let me. So now we do it messy.

483
00:41:27,461 --> 00:41:28,837
Too late, Judge.

484
00:41:32,633 --> 00:41:34,051
Caleb, come in.

485
00:41:34,343 --> 00:41:35,552
Ma.

486
00:41:36,595 --> 00:41:37,930
We've got them cornered.

487
00:41:38,013 --> 00:41:39,848
We're taking them down right now.

488
00:41:47,481 --> 00:41:49,399
We'd need oxyacetylene to cut through.

489
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,109
They know where we are.

490
00:41:51,193 --> 00:41:52,653
Why aren't they coming after us?

491
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:55,239
That's what worries me.

492
00:41:59,743 --> 00:42:01,662
Take him back to the main lobby.

493
00:42:01,745 --> 00:42:03,747
Hold position behind the elevator shaft.

494
00:42:04,581 --> 00:42:05,791
Be a good place to defend.

495
00:42:07,459 --> 00:42:08,669
Where are you going?

496
00:42:10,045 --> 00:42:12,256
If I don't come back, and you get cornered,

497
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:15,739
you might not wanna get taken alive.

498
00:42:18,929 --> 00:42:19,930
Your call.

499
00:42:21,265 --> 00:42:22,266
Sir.

500
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,549
Get away from the door!

501
00:43:05,267 --> 00:43:06,602
Sit down!

502
00:43:26,955 --> 00:43:28,498
He's right, you know.

503
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:32,002
About not wanting to be taken alive.

504
00:43:33,962 --> 00:43:36,590
The stuff the Clan would do
to a girl like you...

505
00:43:39,926 --> 00:43:40,927
Nasty.

506
00:43:52,814 --> 00:43:55,776
We had a girl one time,
girl about your age and...

507
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,492
Well, anyway...

508
00:44:05,202 --> 00:44:08,205
I'm just saying,
save the last bullet for yourself.

509
00:44:08,664 --> 00:44:10,666
Yeah, and I'll save
the second to last one for you.

510
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:12,334
Sure.

511
00:44:16,505 --> 00:44:17,798
So you're a mutant?

512
00:44:19,216 --> 00:44:23,053
Most of you poor fuckers
got three stumpy arms, or no arms.

513
00:44:24,471 --> 00:44:29,559
But I guess you lucked out.
You fit together pretty well.

514
00:44:34,439 --> 00:44:35,774
Psychic.

515
00:44:35,857 --> 00:44:38,151
So fucked up.

516
00:44:40,153 --> 00:44:41,905
Yeah, I heard about your kind.

517
00:44:43,156 --> 00:44:45,033
Kind of hard to believe it's real.

518
00:44:48,245 --> 00:44:49,871
Like what am I thinking about right now?

519
00:44:56,753 --> 00:44:59,589
You're picturing a violent sexual liaison
between the two of us

520
00:44:59,673 --> 00:45:02,050
in a pointless attempt to shock me.

521
00:45:04,511 --> 00:45:06,847
You're good.
But I wasn't trying to shock you.

522
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:08,181
If I was trying to shock you,

523
00:45:08,265 --> 00:45:09,766
I'd have been thinking about this.

524
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:13,687
What are you thinking about now, huh?

525
00:45:31,288 --> 00:45:33,457
- What the fuck was that?
- Get back inside.

526
00:45:37,335 --> 00:45:39,004
Hurry the fuck up.

527
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,882
Move your fucking asses.

528
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,195
Move! Move!

529
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:09,367
Back in the house.
Get in the house, now!

530
00:46:14,498 --> 00:46:15,540
Shit!

531
00:46:15,916 --> 00:46:17,083
Fire!

532
00:46:26,927 --> 00:46:28,887
Frank! Frankie! Let's go!

533
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:01,211
Move.

534
00:47:28,154 --> 00:47:29,573
Get back!

535
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,540
Concentrate the fire.

536
00:47:52,262 --> 00:47:53,680
High ex!

537
00:47:56,141 --> 00:47:57,142
Move!

538
00:49:08,171 --> 00:49:10,215
There's no way they survived.

539
00:49:11,633 --> 00:49:13,677
They're not dead till we find them dead.

540
00:49:17,847 --> 00:49:19,349
Or part of them anyway.

541
00:49:35,699 --> 00:49:37,492
Comms are back on.

542
00:49:38,702 --> 00:49:40,453
Control. Do you copy?

543
00:49:40,745 --> 00:49:41,955
Affirmative.

544
00:49:42,038 --> 00:49:46,167
10-24 on my GPS.
Request immediate assistance.

545
00:49:46,251 --> 00:49:49,170
Copy, 10-24. Judges under fire.

546
00:49:49,254 --> 00:49:52,298
Showing your location as Peach Trees,
Sector 13.

547
00:49:52,382 --> 00:49:53,466
Confirm.

548
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:56,553
Confirm. Be advised,
blast door defenses have been triggered.

549
00:49:58,596 --> 00:50:00,098
Can you hold your current GPS?

550
00:50:04,102 --> 00:50:05,437
Negative.

551
00:50:06,563 --> 00:50:08,857
If they come for us,
we've got nowhere to go.

552
00:50:09,274 --> 00:50:12,944
Copy that. Backup is on its way.
Just stay alive.

553
00:50:15,405 --> 00:50:17,073
We gotta go back in.

554
00:50:48,772 --> 00:50:51,483
God damn it, man! What the fuck?

555
00:50:54,569 --> 00:50:56,279
No! No, no!

556
00:51:29,479 --> 00:51:31,523
Your gang locks down the whole block.

557
00:51:33,149 --> 00:51:36,319
Massacres an entire quadrant of men,
women and children,

558
00:51:36,444 --> 00:51:38,154
just to take out two Judges.

559
00:51:38,947 --> 00:51:41,157
Sound like overkill to you?

560
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:55,171
I'll tell you what I think.

561
00:51:56,047 --> 00:51:57,841
I think if we'd executed you at the bust,

562
00:51:58,007 --> 00:52:00,301
Ma-Ma would have let us walk out of here.

563
00:52:03,513 --> 00:52:07,058
What she doesn't want
is you taken back to the Sector house.

564
00:52:07,142 --> 00:52:08,935
She doesn't want you interrogated.

565
00:52:09,018 --> 00:52:11,312
She's afraid of what you might say.

566
00:52:12,355 --> 00:52:13,982
And that's got me curious.

567
00:52:17,819 --> 00:52:18,862
Spin it!

568
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:20,196
FUCK you!

569
00:52:24,868 --> 00:52:25,952
Sir.

570
00:52:27,328 --> 00:52:28,371
Sir!

571
00:52:29,539 --> 00:52:31,958
If you leave it to me,
he doesn't have to speak.

572
00:52:47,682 --> 00:52:50,518
What are you up to, bitch?

573
00:52:54,439 --> 00:52:56,566
Welcome to the inside of your head.

574
00:52:59,569 --> 00:53:01,112
It's kind of empty in here.

575
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:05,825
I don't know what kind
of mutant shit this is,

576
00:53:05,909 --> 00:53:07,368
but if my hands weren't cuffed...

577
00:53:07,452 --> 00:53:09,579
You aren't cuffed, if you don't wanna be.

578
00:53:15,752 --> 00:53:18,171
My head. Do what I like?

579
00:53:18,254 --> 00:53:19,339
Sure.

580
00:53:23,259 --> 00:53:26,346
Thinking about hurting
me doesn't actually hurt me.

581
00:53:26,429 --> 00:53:28,598
Yeah. Points to you.

582
00:53:29,474 --> 00:53:32,560
Except there is that thing.

583
00:53:33,269 --> 00:53:34,771
What thing was that?

584
00:53:34,896 --> 00:53:36,606
That I know how to freak you the fuck out.

585
00:53:37,565 --> 00:53:40,610
See, if you're talking about
my fucked-up head

586
00:53:41,736 --> 00:53:44,113
versus your fucked-up head,

587
00:53:46,449 --> 00:53:48,618
your fucked-up head is gonna lose.

588
00:53:52,914 --> 00:53:54,707
I figured that would shut you up.

589
00:53:55,124 --> 00:53:57,627
Hey. I can play mind games, too.

590
00:54:00,296 --> 00:54:03,758
You fucking bitch! You sick fucking bitch!

591
00:54:04,133 --> 00:54:05,635
We haven't even started.

592
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:21,776
Got it.

593
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:29,409
Peach Trees is the manufacturing base

594
00:54:29,492 --> 00:54:32,036
for all the Slo-Mo in Mega City One.

595
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,288
Ma-Ma's controlling the production

596
00:54:33,371 --> 00:54:35,331
and distribution across the whole city.

597
00:54:37,959 --> 00:54:39,294
Interesting.

598
00:54:50,555 --> 00:54:52,181
Peach Trees. Can I help you?

599
00:54:52,557 --> 00:54:53,808
We're responding to a report of

600
00:54:53,891 --> 00:54:55,531
Judges under fire from within this block.

601
00:54:55,601 --> 00:54:58,438
Judges under fire?
I'm unaware of any such activity.

602
00:54:58,688 --> 00:55:01,149
We're actually undergoing
a scheduled war defense test.

603
00:55:01,607 --> 00:55:05,528
Not any more, you're not.
Open the blast door right now.

604
00:55:05,611 --> 00:55:09,032
Yes, sir. The problem is
we've had a software malfunction

605
00:55:09,115 --> 00:55:11,034
and I've lost control of the system.

606
00:55:12,577 --> 00:55:14,871
We've had a fire on level 76.

607
00:55:19,125 --> 00:55:20,726
You better get control fast.

608
00:55:20,752 --> 00:55:23,629
Or I'm slapping you
with an obstruction of justice charge.

609
00:55:23,713 --> 00:55:26,466
Five years in the cubes, mandatory.

610
00:55:26,549 --> 00:55:28,885
Will do, sir. I'm on it right now.
Thank you.

611
00:55:38,186 --> 00:55:39,896
We have new intel about Ma-Ma,

612
00:55:39,979 --> 00:55:42,357
and we've managed to get
a 10-24 to Control.

613
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,192
Parameters are shifting.

614
00:55:44,275 --> 00:55:45,735
What are the options, Anderson?

615
00:55:45,818 --> 00:55:49,989
Keep moving and attempt to avoid further
detection, or find a place to defend.

616
00:55:50,073 --> 00:55:52,113
Same as before, except now
we know backup's inbound.

617
00:55:52,867 --> 00:55:55,411
You're giving us two options.
Defend or hide.

618
00:55:55,661 --> 00:55:56,996
Yes, sir.

619
00:55:57,663 --> 00:56:00,249
What about we attack.
Head straight for Ma-Ma.

620
00:56:01,125 --> 00:56:02,543
Is that an option?

621
00:56:03,211 --> 00:56:05,755
Well, she's guilty. We're Judges.

622
00:56:06,422 --> 00:56:08,007
With backup inbound, I think we should wait

623
00:56:08,091 --> 00:56:09,759
until the odds have shifted in our favor.

624
00:56:13,262 --> 00:56:14,514
Wrong answer?

625
00:56:15,556 --> 00:56:16,891
You're the psychic.

626
00:56:28,528 --> 00:56:29,529
Clear.

627
00:56:39,956 --> 00:56:41,624
Why didn't you shoot him?

628
00:56:41,749 --> 00:56:45,086
What do you mean, why didn't I shoot him?
Why didn't you?

629
00:56:46,546 --> 00:56:49,215
- Okay, we could do it now.
- Do it.

630
00:56:52,051 --> 00:56:53,803
Shit! Shit!

631
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,681
Why did it have to be us who found him?

632
00:56:57,598 --> 00:56:59,809
All right. Come on. Come on.

633
00:57:04,939 --> 00:57:07,400
Info terminal.
Let's check the schematics.

634
00:57:28,629 --> 00:57:29,839
Freeze!

635
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:35,803
Why?

636
00:57:39,056 --> 00:57:40,099
Why what?

637
00:57:42,768 --> 00:57:44,145
Well, why should I freeze?

638
00:57:47,398 --> 00:57:50,234
Because otherwise I'll shoot you.

639
00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:53,279
With the safety on?

640
00:57:55,406 --> 00:57:56,407
It isn't.

641
00:58:02,914 --> 00:58:06,876
How do you want it, kids?
Body bags or juve-cubes?

642
00:58:06,959 --> 00:58:08,586
Makes no difference to me.

643
00:58:12,048 --> 00:58:13,549
Fuck!

644
00:58:16,511 --> 00:58:17,595
Stun!

645
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:42,119
You are so fucked.

646
00:58:59,929 --> 00:59:02,014
- Blondie.
- Come on!

647
00:59:02,098 --> 00:59:03,933
Come on, you bitch.

648
00:59:07,311 --> 00:59:08,980
Hold her down, man.

649
00:59:17,238 --> 00:59:18,322
Jesus.

650
00:59:18,447 --> 00:59:19,824
Now then, what am I gonna do with you?

651
00:59:19,907 --> 00:59:21,450
You're going to do nothing.

652
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:27,456
All this trouble is your doing.

653
00:59:28,583 --> 00:59:31,002
When you got busted,
you should have killed the Judges

654
00:59:31,085 --> 00:59:32,503
or been killed yourself.

655
00:59:34,463 --> 00:59:36,007
But instead you let yourself get taken

656
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:37,592
like the dumb fuck you are.

657
00:59:41,304 --> 00:59:42,972
Shut the fuck up.

658
00:59:45,141 --> 00:59:47,221
I'd kill you myself,
but I already lost plenty today.

659
00:59:47,268 --> 00:59:48,811
I can't afford to lose more.

660
00:59:58,195 --> 00:59:59,780
Sooner or later the Justice Department

661
00:59:59,864 --> 01:00:03,034
is gonna come through
the blast doors looking for their judges.

662
01:00:05,161 --> 01:00:06,996
They'll find their bodies all shot up.

663
01:00:08,122 --> 01:00:09,874
One on level 25,

664
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,337
one in the Slo-Mo den.
Just a bust that went wrong.

665
01:00:15,796 --> 01:00:17,798
That means no torture.

666
01:00:18,299 --> 01:00:19,634
No raping, no skinning.

667
01:00:19,717 --> 01:00:22,094
Just a bunch of bullets
to the head and chest.

668
01:00:22,428 --> 01:00:24,138
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

669
01:00:24,221 --> 01:00:25,389
Do you fucking understand me?

670
01:00:25,473 --> 01:00:27,058
Yes.

671
01:00:27,141 --> 01:00:28,225
Ma.

672
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:31,937
He's back.

673
01:00:42,907 --> 01:00:44,533
The other judge has patched himself

674
01:00:44,617 --> 01:00:46,160
into one of the terminals.

675
01:00:46,243 --> 01:00:47,787
I think he's trying to access the PA.

676
01:00:48,329 --> 01:00:49,872
Can't you stop him?

677
01:00:49,955 --> 01:00:51,123
I can shut down the whole system,

678
01:00:51,207 --> 01:00:52,667
but if you let him talk,

679
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,335
I can trace which terminal he's using.

680
01:00:56,253 --> 01:00:57,880
We'll know exactly where he is.

681
01:01:10,768 --> 01:01:13,187
Inhabitants of Peach Trees.

682
01:01:14,021 --> 01:01:15,898
This is Judge Dredd.

683
01:01:18,192 --> 01:01:19,527
Let him talk.

684
01:01:20,361 --> 01:01:22,405
In case you people have forgotten,

685
01:01:23,572 --> 01:01:25,574
this block operates under the same rules

686
01:01:25,658 --> 01:01:27,284
as the rest of the city.

687
01:01:28,577 --> 01:01:30,287
Ma-Ma is not the law.

688
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:32,915
I am the law.

689
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,836
Ma-Ma is a common criminal.

690
01:01:38,504 --> 01:01:40,464
Guilty of murder.

691
01:01:41,465 --> 01:01:43,551
Guilty of the manufacture and distribution

692
01:01:43,634 --> 01:01:45,636
of the narcotic known as Slo-Mo.

693
01:01:46,429 --> 01:01:49,765
And as of now, under sentence of death.

694
01:01:51,475 --> 01:01:53,394
Any who obstruct me in carrying out my duty

695
01:01:53,477 --> 01:01:56,188
will be treated as an
accessory to her crimes.

696
01:01:57,648 --> 01:01:59,650
You have been warned.

697
01:02:01,485 --> 01:02:03,487
And as for you, Ma-Ma...

698
01:02:05,781 --> 01:02:07,450
Judgment time.

699
01:02:10,953 --> 01:02:12,955
I got him. He's only 10 levels below us.

700
01:02:13,038 --> 01:02:14,915
South quad balcony. Terminal 5.

701
01:02:16,292 --> 01:02:17,626
Motherfucker.

702
01:02:39,231 --> 01:02:41,484
Fucker still hasn't gone down.

703
01:03:03,172 --> 01:03:04,757
It's not him.

704
01:03:08,719 --> 01:03:10,179
Incendiary.

705
01:03:49,176 --> 01:03:51,303
How the fuck
are we gonna stop this guy?

706
01:03:55,349 --> 01:03:56,475
Call 911.

707
01:04:26,005 --> 01:04:28,299
Got a 10-24 from this block.

708
01:04:28,424 --> 01:04:32,720
Two judges under fire, requesting urgent
assistance and you're standing outside.

709
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:34,221
Block's under lockdown.

710
01:04:34,305 --> 01:04:36,432
Malfunction with their defense system.

711
01:04:42,229 --> 01:04:43,564
Open up. Now!

712
01:04:50,195 --> 01:04:51,614
You're relieved.

713
01:05:06,962 --> 01:05:08,714
So what have we got?

714
01:05:08,839 --> 01:05:10,591
Two Judges trigger a turf war.

715
01:05:10,674 --> 01:05:12,343
Judges die in pursuit of duty.

716
01:05:12,468 --> 01:05:13,908
And the perps who killed the Judges?

717
01:05:13,928 --> 01:05:15,262
Laid out here.

718
01:05:15,346 --> 01:05:17,222
- Sounds right.
- Excuse me.

719
01:05:19,934 --> 01:05:21,185
It's not what's happened.

720
01:05:21,268 --> 01:05:22,895
I've been here from the start.

721
01:05:22,978 --> 01:05:25,898
This killing's all about one gang.
The Ma-Ma Clan.

722
01:05:25,981 --> 01:05:27,650
And from the sound of gunfire,

723
01:05:27,733 --> 01:05:29,985
I'd say at least one of your two judges
is still alive.

724
01:05:30,653 --> 01:05:32,112
Are you prepared to testify to that?

725
01:05:32,196 --> 01:05:33,364
Sure.

726
01:05:58,263 --> 01:05:59,431
One million credits.

727
01:06:00,891 --> 01:06:02,101
A million?

728
01:06:02,226 --> 01:06:03,560
You have a problem with a Judge.

729
01:06:03,644 --> 01:06:04,979
You know who he is?

730
01:06:05,062 --> 01:06:06,188
No.

731
01:06:06,897 --> 01:06:08,983
I do. One million.

732
01:06:10,567 --> 01:06:11,652
Fine.

733
01:06:11,735 --> 01:06:13,821
Kaplan, protection detail on client.

734
01:06:13,904 --> 01:06:16,740
Chan, Alvarez, we're flushing him out.

735
01:06:16,824 --> 01:06:18,117
You got it.

736
01:06:18,784 --> 01:06:20,369
Where's the other one? The rookie.

737
01:06:20,452 --> 01:06:21,704
We got her here.

738
01:06:21,787 --> 01:06:23,288
Dead or alive?

739
01:06:23,372 --> 01:06:24,540
Alive.

740
01:06:25,249 --> 01:06:26,542
Make her dead.

741
01:08:09,645 --> 01:08:11,980
You, there. Identify yourself.

742
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:14,817
Chan. Sector 9.

743
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,443
Dredd. Sector 13.

744
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:19,988
Responding to your 10-24.

745
01:08:26,161 --> 01:08:27,788
Good to see you, Dredd.

746
01:08:28,455 --> 01:08:30,666
Likewise. You alone?

747
01:08:30,749 --> 01:08:32,376
Negative. Three man squad.

748
01:08:32,459 --> 01:08:34,086
Closing on my vector right now.

749
01:08:35,671 --> 01:08:37,005
So relax.

750
01:08:37,381 --> 01:08:39,091
Cavalry's here.

751
01:08:41,552 --> 01:08:42,636
Two.

752
01:08:43,554 --> 01:08:44,638
Two?

753
01:08:45,597 --> 01:08:47,683
Two of us called in the 10-24.

754
01:08:49,393 --> 01:08:52,312
Wondering why
you didn't ask about the other one.

755
01:08:54,064 --> 01:08:55,190
Lex, move it!

756
01:09:03,073 --> 01:09:04,700
Choke on it, Dredd.

757
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:19,923
Choke on that.

758
01:09:35,189 --> 01:09:36,857
LEXI Oh, shit!

759
01:10:00,047 --> 01:10:04,051
Bet you thought you were gonna
make your family proud, huh?

760
01:10:06,178 --> 01:10:07,638
Not much chance of that now.

761
01:10:09,765 --> 01:10:12,935
Now this, I always wanted one of these.
This is...

762
01:10:13,018 --> 01:10:14,019
Ooh!

763
01:10:14,603 --> 01:10:18,106
You were shit out of luck
when you ran into the Ma-Ma clan.

764
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:19,775
But don't feel too bad.

765
01:10:20,025 --> 01:10:22,027
I seen a lot of Judges in my time,

766
01:10:22,110 --> 01:10:24,112
and you're just not cut out for this.

767
01:10:25,113 --> 01:10:27,449
I mean, if you didn't get killed today,

768
01:10:27,532 --> 01:10:28,909
it was gonna be tomorrow.

769
01:10:28,992 --> 01:10:30,994
Or it was gonna be the day after that.

770
01:10:33,163 --> 01:10:34,289
Anyway,

771
01:10:35,457 --> 01:10:37,209
today it is.

772
01:10:41,129 --> 01:10:43,423
You got any last words, bitch?

773
01:10:48,178 --> 01:10:49,388
That's funny.

774
01:10:50,514 --> 01:10:52,099
I was gonna ask you that.

775
01:10:53,308 --> 01:10:54,476
Bitch.

776
01:11:41,606 --> 01:11:43,191
Kay's dead.

777
01:11:43,608 --> 01:11:44,860
Find somewhere to hide.

778
01:11:44,943 --> 01:11:46,403
Where are you going?

779
01:11:46,486 --> 01:11:49,948
I've got the girl cold.
I see her first, I shoot her.

780
01:11:50,032 --> 01:11:52,284
She sees me first, she hesitates,

781
01:11:52,367 --> 01:11:54,036
then I shoot her.

782
01:13:27,504 --> 01:13:29,631
What's the price of a judge these days?

783
01:13:31,758 --> 01:13:33,093
Million.

784
01:13:38,348 --> 01:13:40,142
Split four ways.

785
01:13:45,063 --> 01:13:46,481
Three ways now.

786
01:13:47,691 --> 01:13:48,859
Suits me.

787
01:13:53,488 --> 01:13:55,157
Doesn't sound like much.

788
01:13:58,869 --> 01:14:00,120
To betray the law.

789
01:14:07,377 --> 01:14:09,004
Betray the city.

790
01:14:12,883 --> 01:14:14,676
Save that shit for the rookies.

791
01:14:15,927 --> 01:14:18,138
Twenty years I've been on the streets.

792
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:23,059
You know what Mega City One is, Dredd?

793
01:14:24,519 --> 01:14:26,938
It's a fucking meat grinder.

794
01:14:27,731 --> 01:14:29,232
People go in one end.

795
01:14:36,281 --> 01:14:38,033
And meat comes out the other.

796
01:14:43,330 --> 01:14:45,081
All we do

797
01:14:45,832 --> 01:14:47,292
is turn the handle.

798
01:14:58,345 --> 01:14:59,387
Rapid fire.

799
01:15:01,306 --> 01:15:03,183
Incendiary. Armor piercing.

800
01:15:04,559 --> 01:15:05,810
High ex.

801
01:15:10,398 --> 01:15:11,775
Motherfucker.

802
01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:17,781
Two-way split.

803
01:15:18,448 --> 01:15:20,367
Yeah, I'd be breaking a sweat,

804
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:22,077
if you hadn't just run out of bullets.

805
01:15:38,635 --> 01:15:41,096
Lower your gun, rookie. I'm your backup.

806
01:16:03,243 --> 01:16:04,494
Armor piercing.

807
01:16:40,363 --> 01:16:41,364
Wait.

808
01:16:44,367 --> 01:16:45,368
Wait?

809
01:16:46,995 --> 01:16:49,914
Are you kidding me?
Did you just say "wait"?

810
01:16:52,959 --> 01:16:54,544
Judge Dredd,

811
01:16:56,296 --> 01:16:58,214
the Judge Dredd

812
01:16:59,049 --> 01:17:01,885
finally gets on the wrong end of a gun,

813
01:17:02,010 --> 01:17:04,971
and what he says is "wait."

814
01:17:06,598 --> 01:17:10,352
You know what? I expected more of you.

815
01:17:11,061 --> 01:17:15,065
I mean, wait for what?
Wait for me to change my mind?

816
01:17:15,398 --> 01:17:16,983
Wait for another two or
three seconds of life

817
01:17:17,067 --> 01:17:18,777
because you're so fucking weak

818
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:20,570
you can't stand to see it end?

819
01:17:21,738 --> 01:17:22,739
No.

820
01:17:30,455 --> 01:17:32,040
Wait for her to shoot you.

821
01:17:38,129 --> 01:17:39,381
Okay.

822
01:17:39,923 --> 01:17:41,508
Basic field dressing.

823
01:18:02,946 --> 01:18:04,280
Reload.

824
01:18:12,247 --> 01:18:13,248
Ready?

825
01:18:13,748 --> 01:18:14,833
Yeah.

826
01:18:15,625 --> 01:18:16,918
You look ready.

827
01:18:49,993 --> 01:18:53,455
No, don't shoot! Please don't shoot me!

828
01:18:53,538 --> 01:18:57,083
I'm not armed. I'm not armed.
I can help you.

829
01:18:57,167 --> 01:18:58,168
How?

830
01:18:58,918 --> 01:19:00,253
Ma-Ma's in her private quarters,

831
01:19:00,336 --> 01:19:03,381
but it's behind 10 inches of steel.

832
01:19:03,465 --> 01:19:05,759
So you can't get in there
without the keypad combination.

833
01:19:05,842 --> 01:19:07,802
I can give that to you.

834
01:19:09,095 --> 01:19:10,255
I don't need your cooperation

835
01:19:10,263 --> 01:19:12,098
to get the combination from you.

836
01:19:14,517 --> 01:19:16,060
I'm sorry.

837
01:19:25,445 --> 01:19:26,488
Go.

838
01:19:27,614 --> 01:19:29,282
Get out of here.

839
01:19:35,455 --> 01:19:37,081
Mind explaining yourself, rookie?

840
01:19:37,165 --> 01:19:40,418
Abetting a felon is not just a fail offense.
It's a crime.

841
01:19:40,502 --> 01:19:44,255
I already picked up the fail
when I lost my primary weapon.

842
01:19:44,339 --> 01:19:45,423
I'm not gonna be a Judge,

843
01:19:45,507 --> 01:19:47,967
and I don't need to be
a mind-reader to know it.

844
01:19:48,092 --> 01:19:49,260
He's a victim, not a perp.

845
01:19:49,344 --> 01:19:51,095
And until my assessment is formally over,

846
01:19:51,179 --> 01:19:53,264
I'm still entitled to dispense justice.

847
01:19:53,348 --> 01:19:55,183
And that's what I just
did by letting him go.

848
01:19:56,935 --> 01:19:59,604
Maybe that'll be
the one difference I do make.

849
01:19:59,687 --> 01:20:03,608
The code to Ma-Ma's chambers is 4-9-4-3-6.

850
01:20:03,691 --> 01:20:05,026
Let's finish this.

851
01:21:34,073 --> 01:21:35,700
You're a piece of work, Dredd.

852
01:21:38,578 --> 01:21:40,288
But then so am I.

853
01:21:41,456 --> 01:21:43,374
You think I didn't know
I'd get busted some day?

854
01:21:43,458 --> 01:21:45,084
Goes with the territory.

855
01:21:46,294 --> 01:21:50,131
This entire level is rigged
with enough high explosives

856
01:21:50,214 --> 01:21:52,216
to take out the top 50 stories.

857
01:21:53,551 --> 01:21:56,220
If they go, the rest go, too.

858
01:22:00,391 --> 01:22:01,643
Like the jewelry?

859
01:22:04,771 --> 01:22:07,148
It's a transmitter synched
to my heart beat.

860
01:22:08,483 --> 01:22:10,485
My heart stops beating,

861
01:22:11,444 --> 01:22:15,657
the building blows. Everyone in it, ash.

862
01:22:19,994 --> 01:22:21,537
You got no way out, Judge.

863
01:22:24,499 --> 01:22:26,000
Put your gun down.

864
01:22:28,252 --> 01:22:31,673
Do you know
how many people live in this block?

865
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:36,844
This isn't a negotiation.
The sentence is death.

866
01:22:38,346 --> 01:22:40,181
You can't afford to take the risk.

867
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:20,471
We're a kilometer above ground.

868
01:23:21,889 --> 01:23:24,559
What do you figure
the range is on that thing?

869
01:23:25,977 --> 01:23:27,979
Could it get through 100
levels of concrete?

870
01:23:29,397 --> 01:23:31,024
How about 200?

871
01:23:32,066 --> 01:23:33,735
Let's find out.

872
01:23:48,166 --> 01:23:52,128
Citizen Ma-Ma.
Your crimes are multiple homicide

873
01:23:52,211 --> 01:23:55,089
and the manufacture
and distribution of narcotics.

874
01:23:55,548 --> 01:23:56,924
How do you plead?

875
01:24:04,057 --> 01:24:05,308
Defense noted.

876
01:26:31,537 --> 01:26:32,580
Yeah!

877
01:27:30,721 --> 01:27:31,847
Anderson.

878
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:34,225
Victims first.

879
01:27:34,308 --> 01:27:36,602
Let the perps lay where they lie, huh?

880
01:27:38,896 --> 01:27:40,398
Your assessment's now over.

881
01:27:56,497 --> 01:27:57,498
Sir.

882
01:28:04,130 --> 01:28:06,090
When I heard you'd called in a 10-24,

883
01:28:06,173 --> 01:28:07,758
I thought I'd better check it out.

884
01:28:07,842 --> 01:28:09,760
Seeing as I forced the rookie on you.

885
01:28:10,428 --> 01:28:12,346
So, what happened in there?

886
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:13,764
Drug bust.

887
01:28:13,848 --> 01:28:15,766
Look like you been through it.

888
01:28:15,850 --> 01:28:17,476
Perps were uncooperative.

889
01:28:18,519 --> 01:28:19,937
So how did she do?

890
01:28:21,188 --> 01:28:23,357
She a pass or a fail?

891
01:28:26,777 --> 01:28:28,321
Let's take a look, huh?

892
01:28:29,155 --> 01:28:30,823
She's a pass.

893
01:28:32,116 --> 01:28:33,576
I knew she would be.

894
01:28:38,789 --> 01:28:40,374
No time to waste. Let's move.

895
01:28:40,458 --> 01:28:41,625
Tell them to go to the back

896
01:28:41,709 --> 01:28:43,586
and we will take the front entrance.

897
01:28:52,345 --> 01:28:54,180
Mega City One.

898
01:28:55,639 --> 01:28:56,891
800 million people

899
01:28:56,974 --> 01:28:59,769
living in the ruin of the old world

900
01:28:59,852 --> 01:29:02,313
and the mega structures of the new one.

901
01:29:04,398 --> 01:29:08,027
Only one thing
fighting for order in the chaos,

902
01:29:09,570 --> 01:29:10,905
Judges.
