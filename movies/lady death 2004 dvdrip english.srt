1
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:24,334
Your army is in place, Milady.

2
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,672
Observe you demon horde!

3
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:30,966
She is here!

4
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,343
We await your command.

5
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,695
What thoughts plague your mind, Milady?

6
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,198
Even such as we fear Lucifer's wrath.

7
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,491
Fear?

8
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,994
l know not the meaning of fear.

9
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,381
Lucifer is a powerful enemy.

10
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,219
We would understand if you choose
not to fight this day.

11
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,681
There is no other choice.

12
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:28,023
Were you not there when l first
took an oath as Lady Death?

13
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,318
The time is now.

14
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,362
We march on Lucifer!

15
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:43,705
l will not stop 'til the ''Lord of Lies'' is dead!

16
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,219
Come on you!

17
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:02,641
Mother, Father, no! No!

18
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:06,937
Release me!

19
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,063
Hold still!

20
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,189
Here's money!

21
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,400
Take it, and leave the boy.

22
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,443
l have no need of your money.

23
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,446
lt's souls l'm after. l've a war to wage!

24
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,950
Only God can take charge of men's souls!

25
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:24,913
Or have you forgotten your place in
God's grand plan, Matthias?

26
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,874
God's grand plan?

27
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,209
Oh no, l haven't forgotten.

28
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,420
Take the boy, and his father.

29
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,884
You beast! He's just a boy!

30
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,136
No! No!

31
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,763
Mother. Mother!

32
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,352
When will the madness end?

33
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:52,816
As long as God rules in Heaven, this
eternal struggle will never end.

34
00:03:57,613 --> 00:04:02,075
Matthias speaks and God answers.

35
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,494
Satisfied, Priest?

36
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:07,998
Perhaps you pray to the wrong god!

37
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,878
God works in mysterious ways.

38
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:21,720
Father in Heaven.
Why have you forsaken us?

39
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,935
l've made up my mind, Hope.

40
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,813
l'm not going back to school at Uppsala.

41
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,232
But Niccolo...

42
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,859
Our world is not ready for science.

43
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,861
At least not the type l wish to learn.

44
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,071
Then what will you do?

45
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,114
Go to where l can learn.

46
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,115
Come with me, Hope.

47
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,534
lt's too dangerous.

48
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,160
The war. The plague.

49
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,370
l've heard this all before.

50
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,579
l can't.

51
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,956
Father would never let me leave.

52
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,875
Your father cares nothing for
you or your safety.

53
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,419
He's utterly consumed by his personal crusade.

54
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,046
He needs me.

55
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:57,506
l need you, too.

56
00:04:57,548 --> 00:05:00,342
Since mother's death, l'm all he has left.

57
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:03,720
l wish she were here now.
She would know what l should do.

58
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,138
l am here.

59
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,558
You are kind and good Niccolo.

60
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,309
Like she was.

61
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,478
Don't ever leave me, Niccolo.
Promise me!

62
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,021
l promise you.

63
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:16,441
We are destined to be together in
this world, and the next.

64
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,318
-Niccolo.
-Hope.

65
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:30,914
Daughter, you disrespect me by
ignoring my wishes!

66
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:34,168
You know you are forbidden to leave the
castle without my permission!

67
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,794
l meant you no disrespect.

68
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,046
My Lord, if you must place blame,

69
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,382
know then that l am the one who is at fault.

70
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:41,675
l see.

71
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:43,177
Niccolo, is it not?

72
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,137
You study medicine at Uppsala?

73
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:48,056
l am Niccolo, but l am no longer a student.

74
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,767
l came to tell Hope that l am
finished at Uppsala.

75
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,019
Excellent.

76
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,479
My army's always in need of
a good surgeon.

77
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,231
l am not a surgeon.

78
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,191
Quiet!

79
00:05:57,232 --> 00:06:00,944
God can ill afford to lose any more
poor souls to the devil!

80
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:04,781
Take our new recruit to the camp,
there are many fresh wounds to sew.

81
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,575
No! Father, No!

82
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,118
No, Niccolo!

83
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,663
Hope, we will be together.
lt is our destiny!

84
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,791
Father, l beg you!

85
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,001
Niccolo is...

86
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:19,463
Niccolo is mine, for all eternity.

87
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:22,633
See to it that my daughter is
returned safely to my castle.

88
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:26,470
You will stay there and reflect upon
your insubordination.

89
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:30,140
l will decide an appropriate punishment
for you when l return.

90
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,176
No.

91
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,111
Niccolo!

92
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:37,791
Lower the bridge!

93
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:19,708
Matthias claims he does God's work.

94
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,919
l say blasphemy!

95
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,464
God would never condone the useless
deaths and atrocities

96
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:28,300
brought about by this madman.

97
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:33,472
Tonight, this unholy travesty
must be put to an end.

98
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:35,474
Are you with me?

99
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,777
l conjure thee, lnvisible Shadow.

100
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:51,573
l call to thee, llluminators of Darkness.

101
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,993
Destroyers of Light.

102
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,996
l call to thee by the name that l was given.

103
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:02,000
l ask thy gate be open.

104
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,753
Open to me!

105
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:08,298
Open the gate!

106
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,884
Come and face us tyrant!

107
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,887
We have a message for Matthias.

108
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,931
lt is late. Come back in the morning.

109
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,641
This cannot wait!

110
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,275
Onward!

111
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:45,961
Niccolo!

112
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:48,463
Hope?!

113
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:49,965
Niccolo!

114
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:52,342
Bad timing, daughter!

115
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,344
Who are you?

116
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:57,556
The better question is, who are you?

117
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:58,432
Take him!

118
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,142
Take the blasphemer!

119
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:04,771
l see you also do the Devil's work.

120
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,398
l'm impressed.

121
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,610
l am a man of God!

122
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:13,614
And yet the blood on your staff would
seem to argue otherwise.

123
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:21,205
l have plans for more, but they'll
wait till tomorrow.

124
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:28,462
As for you, l'm afraid your punishment
will have to wait.

125
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:30,631
See you in Hell, Daughter!

126
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:51,443
Unholy spawn of evil.

127
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:55,405
You shall be condemned to death
for the sins of your father!

128
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,659
God help me...

129
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,673
l wasn't expecting visitors.

130
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,968
But l do appreciate the company.

131
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:18,554
Don't go!

132
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,389
l see you are awake.

133
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,182
What do you plan to do with me?

134
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:25,102
lsn't it obvious, girl?

135
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:28,897
l had no part in my father's affairs.

136
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:31,400
Do you take me for a fool?

137
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:38,073
How else can you explain why you were
not destroyed by Lucifer's deadly fire?

138
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,410
l have no explanation.

139
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:46,415
How long have you been the Devil's consort?

140
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,460
How dare you! He was my father.

141
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:56,592
Does the devil come to you other
than in his earthly guise?

142
00:11:57,176 --> 00:12:00,429
Now, reveal your witch's secrets to me!

143
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:03,432
We have nothing further to say.

144
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:04,600
So be it!

145
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,936
You will burn in Hell for all eternity!

146
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:16,528
l suggest you make peace with
whatever gods you worship.

147
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:19,865
Confession is good for the soul.

148
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:22,868
Even one as cursed as yours.

149
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,377
So, you didn't leave after all.

150
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:35,172
Actually, l just got here.

151
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:37,925
You will have to forgive the delay.

152
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,973
l am Pagan. Court Jester to
the Prince of Darkness.

153
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,433
And you are?

154
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:49,061
No, don't tell me. Let me guess...

155
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,646
You are Hope!

156
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:54,691
The hopelessly naive daughter of
Matthias, also known as...

157
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,194
Lucifer, the Lord of Lies.

158
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:01,406
And, thank God, you don't
look a thing like him.

159
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:05,953
God, if l have done anything to offend
you, l ask your forgiveness.

160
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:10,415
Oh please! You think that's going to keep
you from burning at the stake?

161
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,252
Get away from me. You're disgusting.

162
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:14,920
l need you...

163
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:15,838
Niccolo!

164
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:19,216
We are destined to be together
in this world and the next.

165
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:20,175
How?

166
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,679
Not one of my better impressions.

167
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,807
Bastard! Why do you torment me?
lsn't my death enough?

168
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:29,643
Mmmm. Actually, now that you mention it...

169
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:30,644
No.

170
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:31,645
What then?

171
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:36,358
l can offer you eternal life alongside
your lover, Niccolo.

172
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,320
All you need do is honor your father and
take your rightful place by his side.

173
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:41,780
Honor Lucifer?

174
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:44,366
lt is a holy commandment.

175
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:47,536
lt's so difficult to keep track these days.

176
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:49,746
Never! Get out.

177
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:50,873
Get out!

178
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:54,376
As you wish, but keep in mind
your father's prayer...

179
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:57,045
When yours fail to bring you salvation.

180
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,547
We'll be waiting.

181
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:00,132
By the way...

182
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:04,094
l have grown rather fond of your
Niccolo in the past few days.

183
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:49,389
For the blasphemy and sins of your father
and your own sins against God,

184
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:55,103
l hereby sentence you to death!

185
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:58,941
Burn, witch!

186
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,776
Burn in Hell!

187
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,362
Burn you heretic!

188
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,364
You may proceed.

189
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,328
No! Oh God!

190
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,706
Help me! God please, help me!

191
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,251
God cannot help you.

192
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:17,793
You are forsaken.

193
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:19,336
Niccolo? No!
You are forsaken.

194
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:19,920
Niccolo? No!
l am waiting for you, Hope.

195
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:21,380
l am waiting for you, Hope.

196
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,340
We can be together again!

197
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:24,424
No!
You know what to do...

198
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:25,425
You know what to do...

199
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:28,846
Speak the prayer and join me for eternity.

200
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,264
No, Niccolo!

201
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:33,141
No, this is not real!

202
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:34,810
You are not here!

203
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:36,812
No! No...

204
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:39,857
Speak the prayer now, before it's too late.

205
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:41,316
Oh God!
Speak the prayer now, before it's too late.

206
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,819
l am waiting for you.

207
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:49,658
Dear Lord, forgive me!

208
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:53,787
l conjure thee, lnvisible Shadow!

209
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:59,042
l call to thee, llluminators of Darkness,
Destroyers of Light!

210
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:02,171
l call to thee by the name l was given.

211
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:04,840
l ask thy gate be open.

212
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:07,009
Open to me!

213
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:25,319
Consume thy sinner and let the wicked burn.

214
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:08,904
Niccolo...

215
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,033
Niccolo?

216
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,162
Where are you?!

217
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:19,164
Where are you... Where are you...

218
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,918
He was here a minute ago.

219
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,170
But um... Well, l lost him.

220
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:26,839
You!

221
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,674
All lies.

222
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,175
l should have known.

223
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,094
What have l done?

224
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:35,264
l damned myself, and my soul for a lie.

225
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,599
Things could be worse.

226
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:39,643
l doubt that.

227
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:42,104
We are in Hell, you know!

228
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:52,781
Believe me, things can get worse.

229
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:02,374
Lucifer's got what he wanted.

230
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,710
Take me to him. Take me to my father.

231
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,461
Maybe later.

232
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:09,089
First, l'll indulge you with
a proper reception

233
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:11,592
and adjust that attitude of yours.

234
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,927
Well, this could take some time.

235
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:27,816
You're turning out to be quite a resilient girl.

236
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:29,151
We'll fix that.

237
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:41,121
Oh, come on, Hope. Work with me.

238
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:42,623
Work with me.

239
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:45,667
God help me...

240
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:49,838
Enough!

241
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,006
Enough, l've had enough.

242
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:54,843
Like l was saying, things will get worse.

243
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,579
l understand my daughter has been
giving you trouble?

244
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:26,959
She has been quite a pill, but
nothing l can't handle, Lord.

245
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:29,044
Then bring her to me at once!

246
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,380
As you wish.

247
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:45,519
Now what, Father?

248
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:48,772
l can put an end to all your suffering.

249
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,859
l've heard that before.

250
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,736
You promise much, but deliver nothing.

251
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:58,991
As my daughter, you possess great power.

252
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:01,910
Power that knows no equal in Heaven or Hell.

253
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,788
l can teach you how to harness this power.

254
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:06,248
Together, we can...

255
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,708
l've had enough of your lies!...

256
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:10,836
You promised l would be with
Niccolo for all eternity.

257
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:14,006
Niccolo... Niccolo...

258
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,341
l wish nothing more than that.

259
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,677
Here is your precious Niccolo...

260
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:22,264
And what's left of your dear, departed mother.

261
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:24,766
Mother?! Oh God, no!

262
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:27,519
What have you done to them?

263
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:29,855
God help them.

264
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:32,441
lt's too late for God's mercy.

265
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:34,026
Their souls are mine.

266
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:39,281
Join me, and l will set them free.

267
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:42,910
Hisssss...

268
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:47,289
Life in Hell can be beautiful, Daughter...

269
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:48,832
lf you let it.

270
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:51,335
Desire equals power.

271
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,170
No more lies!

272
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,672
Kill me, demon! Kill me now!

273
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,716
So be it!

274
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:09,228
You'll be back.

275
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:06,094
Hear me, Lucifer.

276
00:23:06,512 --> 00:23:08,805
Hope is dead!

277
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:14,061
l have taken her place.

278
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:17,272
And l will find a way to destroy you!

279
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:29,660
l'm impressed. The Nameless Wolves
are not so easily tamed.

280
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:31,745
Who are you!?

281
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:34,248
Have no fear. l am Cremator.

282
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:37,960
And ever since l first saw your entrance
through the Gates of Hell,

283
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:42,381
l knew you would be the one who could
defy the Lord of Lies and survive.

284
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,883
l don't understand.

285
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,094
lt's a long story.

286
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:48,720
We have time.

287
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:54,101
l was once known as the chief weapons
master to the Archdukes of Hell.

288
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:59,022
A slave with the ability to harness the
fires of Hell with my own hands.

289
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,443
Now l seek purpose, like you.

290
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:07,447
What does all this have to do with Lucifer?

291
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,492
There was a time...

292
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:16,164
Long ago, when l discovered that Lucifer's
was the cause of my mortal death.

293
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:21,920
My existence unraveled, as l was forced into
slavery to spare the soul of the one l loved.

294
00:24:24,173 --> 00:24:27,801
The torment was more than any soul could bear.

295
00:24:29,011 --> 00:24:30,470
l hungered for revenge!

296
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:31,180
Lucifer! Now you die!
l hungered for revenge!

297
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:32,806
Lucifer! Now you die!
So, l challenged him...

298
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:39,271
Gya!

299
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:41,190
and failed.

300
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:46,111
Lucifer spared my soul, but cursed me
with a constant reminder of the truth.

301
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:48,113
l underestimated him.

302
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:51,533
l will not make that same mistake again.

303
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:53,744
And what is that truth?

304
00:24:53,744 --> 00:24:56,038
There's no freedom in Hell!

305
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,707
l've merely escaped his clutches
for the moment.

306
00:24:58,749 --> 00:25:00,000
As you must have.

307
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:04,546
The Prince of Darkness is powerful,
but he's not invincible.

308
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:09,384
How is it that you have managed
to survive his wrath?

309
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:11,178
l am his daughter...

310
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,348
And l will not rest until l've destroyed him.

311
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:18,727
Then l see we have something in common.

312
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,609
Come. We have work to do, if we plan
to defeat the Lord of Lies.

313
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:27,945
What is this place?

314
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:30,239
This is the Chasm of Ptolomea.

315
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,991
Here we are safe from Lucifer's influence.

316
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:36,411
So how will we get close to Lucifer?

317
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:38,872
lt will be difficult to catch him off guard.

318
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:43,544
To defeat him will take time, patience
and careful preparation.

319
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:46,547
So when do we start?

320
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:49,967
That is entirely up to you.

321
00:30:48,265 --> 00:30:50,267
Your cape, Milady.

322
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:56,565
You have learned much during
your time in Hell;

323
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:58,942
yet your spirit seems troubled.

324
00:30:59,693 --> 00:31:01,737
You taught me to be a warrior.

325
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:04,406
To draw upon my inner strength.

326
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,576
Yet there is a power in me
which l cannot control.

327
00:31:08,994 --> 00:31:13,207
You once told me Lucifer said,
''Desire equals power.''

328
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:14,333
Do you remember?

329
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:16,335
That was years ago.

330
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:19,087
l desire nothing more than to destroy him.

331
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:23,175
And in the process free the souls
of my mother and Niccolo.

332
00:31:23,592 --> 00:31:28,972
Still desire has not helped me channel
the power we both know l possess.

333
00:31:29,014 --> 00:31:32,476
You have the power, worthy of Hell's kingdom.

334
00:31:32,643 --> 00:31:35,979
What we must now do is focus on
acquiring the right tool

335
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:38,315
that can harness the power within you.

336
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:40,275
A tool?

337
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:41,777
That's right.

338
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:45,239
And l know where one can be found.

339
00:31:46,949 --> 00:31:48,784
So, what are we waiting for?

340
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:50,410
lt will not be easy.

341
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,830
Nothing will stand in my way.

342
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:57,751
You have learned to focus your
energy through your swords.

343
00:31:57,793 --> 00:32:02,506
The trouble is, they were not forged to
withstand such power internally.

344
00:32:02,548 --> 00:32:04,174
l know all that.

345
00:32:04,216 --> 00:32:08,095
When l was Hell's chief weaponmaster,
l made a sword,

346
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:10,973
the likes of which had never
been seen before.

347
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:16,019
That sword, named Darkness,
belongs to Asmodeus.

348
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:20,983
An Archduke charged with protecting the
gates leading to the seventh level of Hell.

349
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:24,486
You think this sword is the tool l need?

350
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:26,989
There is only one way to find out.

351
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,658
Then it's decided. Alert our troops.

352
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:33,787
Milady, if l may suggest.

353
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:34,997
What is it!?

354
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:37,958
Better to go in with a small, handpicked team.

355
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,335
Now is not the time for open war.

356
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:42,671
We could lose the element of surprise.

357
00:32:42,713 --> 00:32:43,755
Then tonight...

358
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:46,258
Asmodeus will fall.

359
00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:49,511
Then let us go and plan for the assault.

360
00:34:10,717 --> 00:34:12,177
Wait here.

361
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:23,897
Haven't you had your fill?

362
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:28,068
What more can you take from me?

363
00:34:28,944 --> 00:34:30,904
Your beauty...

364
00:34:55,345 --> 00:34:57,514
Who's next?

365
00:34:57,848 --> 00:34:59,975
Bastard! Why?

366
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:03,270
Asmodeus' idea of fun.

367
00:35:03,312 --> 00:35:05,647
Why should he have all the fun?

368
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,109
Asmodeus!

369
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,864
Death has arrived!

370
00:35:26,877 --> 00:35:30,839
l'm going to enjoy ripping you to pieces!

371
00:35:31,882 --> 00:35:32,883
Hellspawn!

372
00:35:32,883 --> 00:35:34,510
No, Cremator.

373
00:35:35,052 --> 00:35:36,678
He's mine.

374
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,433
Foolish girl, death facilitates
the pleasures of Hell.

375
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:46,146
But it is no excuse for invading my realm!

376
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:53,695
What a pity...

377
00:35:53,737 --> 00:35:55,781
All bark and no bite!

378
00:35:59,535 --> 00:36:00,494
No, Cremator!

379
00:36:02,538 --> 00:36:04,540
Too easy...

380
00:36:04,581 --> 00:36:06,875
Care to try that again?!

381
00:36:07,334 --> 00:36:10,170
Alright demon, let's end this!

382
00:36:24,268 --> 00:36:25,561
Enough!

383
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:38,699
You were right; this is too easy.

384
00:36:44,663 --> 00:36:46,748
Who are you?

385
00:36:49,168 --> 00:36:51,461
Death... Lady Death.

386
00:37:02,055 --> 00:37:05,434
lnsolent wench! You cannot kill me!

387
00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:09,605
l am Asmodeus, Archduke of the...

388
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:23,160
lmpressive, for a Hell-spawned smith.

389
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:43,096
Asmodeus is no more...

390
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:48,852
All that was his now belongs
to me, Lady Death!

391
00:37:49,311 --> 00:37:53,315
Soon we march on the Lord of Darkness.

392
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:58,403
Stay here and face certain death
at the hands of Lucifer...

393
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:02,658
or join us in our fight against
the great blasphemer.

394
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:05,410
The choice is yours.

395
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:14,294
l will search for weapons and supplies
that can be of use to us, Milady.

396
00:38:14,378 --> 00:38:16,338
We should leave at once.

397
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:48,579
You see, the beast is deranged.
lt tried to kill me!

398
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:51,373
A pity that such a magnificent animal...

399
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:54,918
must be destroyed.

400
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,212
What's all this talk of destruction?

401
00:38:57,671 --> 00:39:01,383
Asmodeus abused this poor animal
to the point of insanity.

402
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:03,051
None can approach it.

403
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:06,722
l see.

404
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:12,352
We can leave it here to descend
on its own private madness.

405
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:15,022
Or we can put it out of its misery.

406
00:39:16,273 --> 00:39:19,902
Or we can remove these shackles
and see what happens.

407
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:20,652
Milady?

408
00:39:20,694 --> 00:39:22,321
Easy boy...

409
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:29,161
Easy boy...

410
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,915
Bring me a saddle.

411
00:39:33,582 --> 00:39:36,084
l said, bring me a saddle!

412
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:40,047
Easy...

413
00:39:52,476 --> 00:39:54,061
There you go.

414
00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:56,980
Easy boy, steady now...

415
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,534
That wasn't so bad now, was it?

416
00:40:09,576 --> 00:40:11,662
ln all my days in Hell...

417
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:14,081
l have never met a soul like you.

418
00:40:14,581 --> 00:40:20,170
Now l have a steed worthy of leading me
into battle against Lucifer himself.

419
00:40:20,212 --> 00:40:24,174
From this day on, you shall be Vassago!

420
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:42,359
Am l missing something?

421
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:45,654
lt's not like Asmodeus to
ignore your summons.

422
00:40:45,696 --> 00:40:50,325
Perhaps l should see whether his corpulence
demands a replacement.

423
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:54,162
When l need a fool to administer the
seventh level, l will call you.

424
00:40:54,204 --> 00:40:57,165
Nevertheless, you have a point, Jester...

425
00:40:57,791 --> 00:41:02,796
lnsubordination can only lead to a
''forced retirement'', shall we say?

426
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:07,634
Well, l wouldn't let this minor annoyance
spoil your imminent victory.

427
00:41:07,676 --> 00:41:11,513
Life in Hell has taught me to enjoy
the simplest of pleasures.

428
00:41:11,555 --> 00:41:14,183
l've waited an eternity for this moment.

429
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:16,310
You know what they say...

430
00:41:16,351 --> 00:41:18,979
Time sure flies when you're having fun.

431
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:22,316
Not only do you play the fool.

432
00:41:22,357 --> 00:41:24,818
You now mock me with your impudence?!!

433
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:28,697
Forgive my indifference, Lord.

434
00:41:28,947 --> 00:41:32,409
A boring jester with nothing more to offer!

435
00:41:32,451 --> 00:41:35,662
Tell me, what are you good for?

436
00:41:36,788 --> 00:41:40,709
Even you must admit, l'm one helluva spy.

437
00:41:40,751 --> 00:41:43,545
As if l need any more of your lot!

438
00:41:45,047 --> 00:41:48,634
l would give a king's ransom
for one good laugh.

439
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:50,344
lf you give me a minute, l'm sure l can...

440
00:41:50,385 --> 00:41:53,555
Leave me! You've wasted enough of my time!

441
00:41:54,806 --> 00:41:56,767
As you command, my Lord.

442
00:42:01,813 --> 00:42:05,776
lt seems our daughter has felt
the raw power of desire.

443
00:42:05,776 --> 00:42:09,404
l suspect she dreams of freeing your soul.

444
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:14,451
Soon she will taste all that Hell has to offer.

445
00:42:15,285 --> 00:42:18,914
The bitter and the sweet.

446
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:23,669
And as for you, you pathetic misguided fool.

447
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:28,632
l'll never understand what she
saw in a weakling like you.

448
00:43:27,232 --> 00:43:28,984
Sleep well, Milady.

449
00:43:29,026 --> 00:43:32,362
From this point on there is no going back.

450
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:39,369
Fool!

451
00:43:43,707 --> 00:43:46,210
What makes you think we're in danger?!

452
00:43:46,543 --> 00:43:49,963
lf l hadn't seen it with my
own eyes... Asmodeus...

453
00:43:50,047 --> 00:43:52,925
Asmodeus was stupid, careless.

454
00:43:52,966 --> 00:43:55,469
Without question, still,

455
00:43:55,511 --> 00:43:56,803
there is the writing on the wall.

456
00:43:56,845 --> 00:43:57,804
Hmm...
there is the writing on the wall.

457
00:43:57,846 --> 00:44:00,682
You cannot ignore your daughter's
hand in this attack.

458
00:44:00,724 --> 00:44:02,768
Like father, like daughter.

459
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:05,687
lt won't be long before your
daughter comes after you.

460
00:44:05,729 --> 00:44:06,730
Ha!

461
00:44:06,772 --> 00:44:10,317
So you think l should tremble in
fear of my ignorant whelp?

462
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:11,777
Ridiculous!

463
00:44:12,236 --> 00:44:13,612
Get out!

464
00:44:16,031 --> 00:44:17,866
No! Wait!

465
00:44:17,908 --> 00:44:20,619
You once told me how good a spy you are.

466
00:44:21,411 --> 00:44:23,664
Find her. Learn her plans.

467
00:44:24,581 --> 00:44:28,710
And you said you'd give a king's
ransom for a good laugh.

468
00:44:28,752 --> 00:44:32,548
l'll collect that ransom when you
laugh over her grave.

469
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:40,764
Hmm...

470
00:44:45,727 --> 00:44:50,357
Hope, we will be together in this world
and the next. lt is our destiny.

471
00:44:55,612 --> 00:45:00,033
Perhaps you can be of some
use to me after all.

472
00:45:15,716 --> 00:45:18,010
Dear Lord, forgive me!

473
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:21,013
Here is your precious Niccolo!

474
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:23,265
No, Niccolo!

475
00:45:23,307 --> 00:45:28,103
Life in Hell can be beautiful
Daughter, if you let it.

476
00:45:30,314 --> 00:45:31,648
No, Niccolo! No!

477
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:33,192
We will be together again!

478
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:34,776
You are forsaken...

479
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:36,528
lt is our destiny!

480
00:45:37,154 --> 00:45:39,698
And what's left of your dear departed mother.

481
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:40,866
No!

482
00:45:40,908 --> 00:45:42,409
God cannot help you...

483
00:45:42,451 --> 00:45:44,870
Desire equals power.

484
00:45:44,912 --> 00:45:47,748
l ask thy gate be open...

485
00:45:47,789 --> 00:45:49,458
Open to me!

486
00:45:51,168 --> 00:45:53,504
As my daughter you possess great power.

487
00:45:53,545 --> 00:45:57,090
Power that knows no equal
in Heaven or Hell!

488
00:46:02,262 --> 00:46:05,641
Why do my thoughts come
back to haunt me?

489
00:46:06,433 --> 00:46:08,393
This is no nightmare...

490
00:46:09,394 --> 00:46:12,147
Hell is as real as flesh and blood.

491
00:46:12,689 --> 00:46:14,024
Go to sleep.

492
00:46:15,067 --> 00:46:18,153
Tomorrow, we march on Lucifer.

493
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,991
You'll be back!

494
00:48:13,393 --> 00:48:16,104
Your daughter has amassed an army.

495
00:48:16,146 --> 00:48:21,693
And by the look of things, she won't stop
'til she reaches the outer walls of Dis.

496
00:48:21,735 --> 00:48:26,240
One other thing, your daughter has changed.

497
00:48:26,323 --> 00:48:27,699
She now calls herself...

498
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:29,284
Lady Death.

499
00:48:30,494 --> 00:48:32,579
lnteresting...

500
00:48:32,663 --> 00:48:35,624
lnteresting choice for a name.

501
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:39,169
Lady Death...

502
00:48:40,003 --> 00:48:41,505
You have served me well.

503
00:48:41,547 --> 00:48:42,923
Now get out!

504
00:48:44,508 --> 00:48:45,843
But what about my reward?

505
00:48:45,884 --> 00:48:47,594
l SAlD GET OUT!!!

506
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,474
Ah... One more thing. She has...

507
00:48:52,516 --> 00:48:54,142
l know all l need to know.

508
00:48:54,184 --> 00:48:55,644
Leave me.

509
00:48:55,686 --> 00:48:59,731
Be grateful l don't cast you into
the River Styx as your reward.

510
00:49:04,444 --> 00:49:06,321
Lady Death...

511
00:49:10,659 --> 00:49:15,873
Abandon hope, all ye who enter here!

512
00:51:29,673 --> 00:51:31,967
Hold your ground!

513
00:51:34,261 --> 00:51:35,220
Hold your gr...

514
00:51:52,237 --> 00:51:53,697
Enough...

515
00:51:53,739 --> 00:51:54,823
Enough!

516
00:51:54,865 --> 00:51:57,326
Tomorrow, Lucifer falls!

517
00:52:01,872 --> 00:52:05,000
You play a dangerous game, Milady...

518
00:52:07,961 --> 00:52:11,298
l still do not understand why you
gave the order to stop.

519
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,175
We could have taken them.

520
00:52:13,217 --> 00:52:15,260
Lucifer's army has grown weak.

521
00:52:15,302 --> 00:52:16,762
Silence!

522
00:52:18,263 --> 00:52:21,016
Have you forgotten where we are?

523
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:25,729
We are in Hell, Lucifer's realm!

524
00:52:25,771 --> 00:52:28,190
lf l have learned anything, it is...

525
00:52:28,232 --> 00:52:32,486
Nothing is as it seems when dealing
with the Lord of Lies.

526
00:52:34,655 --> 00:52:37,199
Our troops fought well this day.

527
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:41,161
l did not want to sacrifice our gains
on the chance, however remote,

528
00:52:41,203 --> 00:52:43,664
that Lucifer's retreat was a trap.

529
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:46,124
We will rest. Regroup.

530
00:52:46,834 --> 00:52:48,877
Assess our strategy...

531
00:52:48,919 --> 00:52:51,421
Then mount our assault!

532
00:52:52,714 --> 00:52:54,967
Now, see to the needs of your troops.

533
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:03,892
Make sure the army is ready.

534
00:53:04,977 --> 00:53:06,436
Milady.

535
00:53:13,944 --> 00:53:15,404
Go with him.

536
00:54:04,161 --> 00:54:08,790
Life in Hell can be beautiful
Daughter, if you let it.

537
00:54:57,381 --> 00:54:59,758
Know this Lucifer.

538
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,344
One way or another.

539
00:55:02,386 --> 00:55:04,847
l will destroy you.

540
00:55:25,742 --> 00:55:29,121
l'm thinking small advance, perhaps?

541
00:55:35,085 --> 00:55:36,170
Hissss!

542
00:55:40,257 --> 00:55:41,341
Pagan?

543
00:55:41,425 --> 00:55:42,509
Get out!

544
00:55:45,095 --> 00:55:47,931
A present for the Prince of Darkness...

545
00:55:47,973 --> 00:55:50,058
Asmodeus' sword...

546
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,269
The key to her power.

547
00:55:58,901 --> 00:56:00,277
Darkness.

548
00:56:01,987 --> 00:56:04,740
Perhaps l underestimated you.

549
00:56:05,991 --> 00:56:07,534
Take your pick.

550
00:56:07,618 --> 00:56:09,328
Whichever one you like.

551
00:56:12,247 --> 00:56:14,374
Consider this my down payment.

552
00:56:15,959 --> 00:56:18,587
Don't push your luck, worm!

553
00:56:34,186 --> 00:56:35,229
Milady.

554
00:56:35,854 --> 00:56:38,815
Lucifer has reclaimed Darkness.

555
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:40,692
How?

556
00:56:40,776 --> 00:56:42,069
Does it really matter?

557
00:56:42,903 --> 00:56:44,863
l will notify the guards.

558
00:56:44,905 --> 00:56:46,281
lt's too late for that.

559
00:56:46,281 --> 00:56:51,119
Do you really think Lucifer would
allow us to beat him in Hell?

560
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,873
Before l met you, l would have said, ''No.''

561
00:56:54,915 --> 00:56:58,001
ln an instant, he turns our
successes into nothing

562
00:56:58,043 --> 00:57:00,546
and leaves me powerless to fulfill my vow.

563
00:57:01,296 --> 00:57:05,384
l still believe you have the power
within you to defeat Lucifer.

564
00:57:05,425 --> 00:57:10,389
Power that can only be channeled through
a sword l no longer possess!

565
00:57:11,223 --> 00:57:14,268
We both know that eventually you
will no longer need a tool

566
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:17,646
to channel the energy flowing inside you.

567
00:57:17,688 --> 00:57:22,651
l just assumed it would come after
we defeated Lucifer, not before.

568
00:57:24,152 --> 00:57:29,283
l know in my heart, that l want nothing
more than to defeat Lucifer.

569
00:57:32,369 --> 00:57:34,621
Desire equals power.

570
00:57:39,042 --> 00:57:42,004
The army need never know.

571
00:57:42,045 --> 00:57:43,672
For luck.

572
00:57:52,222 --> 00:57:53,682
For luck.

573
00:58:05,527 --> 00:58:06,987
The time is now...

574
00:58:07,738 --> 00:58:09,990
We march on Lucifer!

575
00:58:14,912 --> 00:58:18,332
l will not stop until the Lord of Lies is dead!

576
00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:32,137
Listen well, my rebellious demons.

577
00:58:33,555 --> 00:58:37,518
l allowed this battle to continue
because it amused me.

578
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:41,230
Death and destruction always amuse me.

579
00:58:42,147 --> 00:58:43,565
Know this...

580
00:58:43,565 --> 00:58:45,692
You cannot defeat me.

581
00:58:46,568 --> 00:58:50,364
No power in Hell can stand up to Lucifer!

582
00:58:50,697 --> 00:58:53,075
Pledge allegiance to me...

583
00:58:53,116 --> 00:58:56,578
And l will make your destruction
swift and painless.

584
00:58:58,455 --> 00:59:00,958
Continue this pointless attack...

585
00:59:00,999 --> 00:59:05,712
And your suffering will define Hell
throughout all eternity!

586
00:59:07,422 --> 00:59:09,758
Never surrender!

587
01:00:47,564 --> 01:00:48,857
Hope...

588
01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:50,526
Niccolo!

589
01:00:57,658 --> 01:01:00,410
You look so different...

590
01:01:00,452 --> 01:01:03,580
No! This is another one of Lucifer's tricks.

591
01:01:05,832 --> 01:01:08,126
This is no trick...

592
01:01:09,878 --> 01:01:11,213
How?

593
01:01:11,255 --> 01:01:13,215
Lucifer offered me my freedom...

594
01:01:15,092 --> 01:01:17,386
lf l agreed to kill you.

595
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:20,013
l agreed...

596
01:01:20,097 --> 01:01:22,224
But only to mislead him.

597
01:01:23,892 --> 01:01:27,688
See, here is the blade l was
supposed to use on you.

598
01:01:31,692 --> 01:01:34,653
Yet, despite my deception,

599
01:01:34,695 --> 01:01:38,699
Lucifer made my freedom contingent
upon your death.

600
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:40,826
A life for a life.

601
01:01:41,451 --> 01:01:44,830
l though l'd be able to stay with you,
and keep my promise,

602
01:01:44,872 --> 01:01:46,582
but l was wrong.

603
01:01:47,583 --> 01:01:48,792
Niccolo!
See! Lucifer knew l would betray him...

604
01:01:48,834 --> 01:01:51,128
See! Lucifer knew l would betray him...

605
01:01:53,422 --> 01:01:56,008
We don't have much time.

606
01:01:56,049 --> 01:01:58,385
He will come after us.

607
01:01:58,427 --> 01:02:01,847
But there is one way we can still prevail.

608
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:02,764
Kill me...

609
01:02:02,764 --> 01:02:03,682
Never!

610
01:02:03,724 --> 01:02:05,225
Please my love...

611
01:02:05,309 --> 01:02:07,102
lt is the only way!

612
01:02:07,144 --> 01:02:08,937
You are safe now.

613
01:02:08,937 --> 01:02:10,856
l will protect you.

614
01:02:11,857 --> 01:02:14,776
You might be able to protect yourself,

615
01:02:14,818 --> 01:02:16,737
But it's too late for me.

616
01:02:17,321 --> 01:02:21,617
Lucifer is powerful in ways
which defy description.

617
01:02:21,617 --> 01:02:24,620
l have only one chance for salvation...

618
01:02:25,495 --> 01:02:29,249
Kill me and release my soul
from this torment!

619
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:31,793
Then l will ascend into Heaven.

620
01:02:35,631 --> 01:02:40,719
How can you be certain that my killing you,
here in Hell, will set your soul free?

621
01:02:41,762 --> 01:02:43,805
My faith in God...

622
01:02:43,847 --> 01:02:49,228
You ask for compassion from someone who
has forgotten the meaning of the word.

623
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:52,773
Yet how can l kill the one l love?

624
01:02:52,814 --> 01:02:56,652
His demons will soon come to collect my soul.

625
01:02:57,819 --> 01:02:59,655
You can free me.

626
01:02:59,696 --> 01:03:01,156
Do it now.

627
01:03:02,658 --> 01:03:04,451
lf you love me...

628
01:03:04,743 --> 01:03:05,786
Kill me!

629
01:03:05,827 --> 01:03:07,204
No, Niccolo!

630
01:03:07,246 --> 01:03:08,705
How could you...

631
01:03:08,747 --> 01:03:10,374
Kill me now!

632
01:03:10,415 --> 01:03:13,293
Or my soul is lost forever...

633
01:03:33,564 --> 01:03:35,357
Goodbye, my love.

634
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:53,083
Hope...

635
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:54,960
We will be together...

636
01:03:55,002 --> 01:03:56,962
For all eternity...

637
01:03:57,004 --> 01:03:59,047
lt is our destiny...

638
01:04:24,072 --> 01:04:27,868
This day, Lucifer falls!

639
01:04:37,127 --> 01:04:40,506
So the prodigal daughter returns?

640
01:04:40,881 --> 01:04:43,425
My plan is nearly complete.

641
01:04:56,271 --> 01:04:59,107
You've changed since we last spoke, Hope.

642
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:01,109
Hope is no more.

643
01:05:03,153 --> 01:05:05,197
Know me as Lady Death.

644
01:05:05,822 --> 01:05:09,493
Welcome to the fold, my dark child...

645
01:05:10,118 --> 01:05:13,080
Desire equals power. Remember?

646
01:05:13,121 --> 01:05:17,376
And there is nothing l desire more than
ending your wretched existence!

647
01:05:17,417 --> 01:05:19,211
ls that so?!

648
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:46,154
Well done, together we will
conquer Heaven itself.

649
01:05:46,822 --> 01:05:49,324
Your dream, not mine.

650
01:06:07,342 --> 01:06:10,345
Burn in Hell, ungrateful whelp!

651
01:06:16,101 --> 01:06:19,229
The seeds of hatred have made you strong,

652
01:06:19,271 --> 01:06:23,442
but you will beg for my
forgiveness nonetheless.

653
01:06:23,984 --> 01:06:25,444
Never!

654
01:06:25,736 --> 01:06:27,362
Forward!

655
01:06:27,696 --> 01:06:30,991
Don't you see? l have corrupted innocence!

656
01:06:32,784 --> 01:06:35,120
Turned light into dark.

657
01:06:35,162 --> 01:06:37,623
All that is left is for you to join me.

658
01:06:37,664 --> 01:06:38,665
Never!

659
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:49,718
Not so fast!

660
01:06:56,517 --> 01:06:59,770
Your mother's conquest was easy.

661
01:06:59,811 --> 01:07:03,065
The pure of heart are so naive.

662
01:07:03,357 --> 01:07:05,484
You may have corrupted her flesh,

663
01:07:05,526 --> 01:07:07,694
but never her soul!

664
01:07:14,785 --> 01:07:19,998
l wonder if you'll scream with pleasure
the same way she did.

665
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,167
Hell spawned bastard!

666
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:46,817
Don't blink... heh heh.

667
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,745
Foolish child.

668
01:07:59,162 --> 01:08:01,999
There's no stopping what can
not be stopped... Huh?

669
01:08:22,811 --> 01:08:24,146
No more!

670
01:08:25,272 --> 01:08:26,565
lt's over!

671
01:08:36,909 --> 01:08:39,661
How dare you strike me?

672
01:08:39,661 --> 01:08:41,330
Quiet!

673
01:08:46,168 --> 01:08:48,587
You have the power to give back my life.

674
01:08:48,629 --> 01:08:49,838
Do it now!

675
01:08:49,838 --> 01:08:50,839
Never!

676
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:52,508
So be it!

677
01:08:52,841 --> 01:08:54,343
Eyah!

678
01:08:57,221 --> 01:08:59,389
l curse you!

679
01:08:59,431 --> 01:09:04,102
So long as one of my allies walks in Hell...

680
01:09:04,144 --> 01:09:07,773
your soul will never go free.

681
01:10:28,979 --> 01:10:29,938
Mother...

682
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:30,939
Hope?

683
01:11:04,306 --> 01:11:05,807
Your soul is free.

684
01:11:05,807 --> 01:11:06,975
How?

685
01:11:07,017 --> 01:11:12,356
The presence of your purity was enough to bring
Hell back into alignment, for the moment.

686
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,900
Come with me, Hope.

687
01:11:15,567 --> 01:11:17,486
Hope is lost.

688
01:11:17,486 --> 01:11:20,614
Pray for her soul as only a mother can.

689
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:23,075
l will never forget you.

690
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:26,620
Farewell, Mother.

691
01:11:48,684 --> 01:11:51,979
The Lord of Lies no longer rules Hell.

692
01:11:53,772 --> 01:11:57,192
From this day forth, Hell is my domain.

693
01:12:05,784 --> 01:12:08,120
You do not belong here.

694
01:12:08,161 --> 01:12:11,456
Lucifer has cursed me to an
unending oblivion in Hell.

695
01:12:11,498 --> 01:12:14,877
Until all his allies are extinguished.

696
01:12:14,918 --> 01:12:17,629
The day will come when your soul will be free.

697
01:12:19,047 --> 01:12:22,968
lf Lucifer's own must die so l
may have my freedom...

698
01:12:23,594 --> 01:12:25,888
Then let the killing begin.

699
01:12:25,929 --> 01:12:29,892
And l shall have their graves waiting!

700
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:47,993
Abandon hope...

701
01:12:48,035 --> 01:12:50,746
All ye who enter here...

702
01:12:50,746 --> 01:12:55,250
Hah ha ha ha ha!
