1
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,355
Wu.

2
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:30,942
You and your brothers
murdered three of our men.

3
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,570
He would have done the same.

4
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,448
<i>Send three more
and I'll kill them too.</i>

5
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:39,701
He already controls
the opium trade all across Asia.

6
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:41,953
<i>May no one prosper but Ying Ko?</i>

7
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:44,956
<i>My poppy fields are tiny...
nothing compared to his.</i>

8
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:48,753
Well, I, Li Peng, at least
I'm entitled to my little piece.

9
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:52,338
Ying Ko, if you kill me,

10
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:56,509
I promise my brothers
will come for you.

11
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,929
And I promise you...

12
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:04,726
I'll bury them beside you.

13
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:06,228
<i>Kill him.</i>

14
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,028
Let me go.

15
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:16,571
<i>I only wish to leave.</i>

16
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:17,698
I'll cut his throat.

17
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:21,577
Your men are not marksmen enough
to shoot around him.

18
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:25,206
You're right.
You're right.

19
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:29,083
Wu, you are a wonderful friend.

20
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,752
<i>Like a father to me.</i>

21
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:32,505
Thank you, Ying Ko.

22
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:36,300
Shoot through him.

23
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,968
Uh!

24
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,314
Where are you taking me?

25
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:36,985
The Tulku wishes to see you
at his temple.

26
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:39,238
A holy man wants to see me?

27
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,199
You call that a temple?

28
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,243
No.
There.

29
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,425
Where did that come from?

30
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:03,012
The clouded mind sees nothing.

31
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,263
Who are you?

32
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,556
I am your teacher.

33
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:52,728
Do you have any idea
who you just kidnapped?

34
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:54,980
Cranston.

35
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,732
Lamont Cranston.

36
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,150
You know my real name?

37
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:00,694
Yes.

38
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,116
I also know that for as long
as you can remember,

39
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:10,745
you've struggled against your own
black heart and always lost.

40
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:14,457
You watched your spirit,
your very face change

41
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,168
<i>as the beast claws
his way out within you.</i>

42
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:21,006
You're in great pain,
aren't you?

43
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:26,844
You know what evil lurks
in the hearts of men,

44
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:29,055
<i>for you have seen that evil
in your own heart.</i>

45
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:32,016
Every man pays the price
for redemption.

46
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,978
- This is yours.
- I'm not lookin' for redemption.

47
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,980
You have no choice.

48
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:39,899
You will be redeemed
because I will teach you

49
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,986
<i>to use your black shadow
to fight evil.</i>

50
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:44,113
I wouldn't do that.

51
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:35,622
Phurba.

52
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:41,879
<i>Phurba!</i>

53
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,508
Am I in hell?

54
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,722
Not yet.

55
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:52,990
Get him, Johnny.

56
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,535
Maxie.

57
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,619
All right,
let's get this over with.

58
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,329
- Get out.
- No.

59
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,289
- Come on, come on!
- No, please.

60
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,959
- Eh, quit your whining.
- I didn't see anything.

61
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:04,169
Is it dry?

62
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,548
Perfect, Duke.

63
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,757
Bring him to the rail.

64
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,259
- Tip him.
- I won't tell anyone.

65
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,262
- I swear.
- Jeez.

66
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,682
I wish I could trust you,
sport, I really do.

67
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:20,185
I guess you just picked
the wrong alley to look down.

68
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,062
I have a family.

69
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,147
They'll get over it.

70
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:25,107
I won't talk.

71
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,401
I- I'm telling you.

72
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,279
Oh, I know you won't.

73
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,198
- Dump him.
- No!

74
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,450
- No, no!
- I hate heavy lifting.

75
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,537
No, no, no!

76
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,500
What the Christ was that?

77
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,877
Who's there?

78
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,347
Show yourself, fella.

79
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:01,601
<i>You murdered a policeman, Duke.</i>

80
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:03,686
Who said that?
Duke?

81
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,438
- Who said that?
- Shut up!

82
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,941
<i>The weed of crime
bears bitter fruit.</i>

83
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,693
I don't like this.

84
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:13,529
This stinks.
Let's get the hell outta here.

85
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,698
Shut your hole, Maxie!

86
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:17,825
<i>Did you think
you'd get away with it?</i>

87
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,118
Come on, Duke!

88
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:26,626
<i>Did you think
I wouldn't know?</i>

89
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:03,622
- Hah!
- Duke, I think you got him.

90
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,501
You're damn right I...

91
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,676
<i>You committed murder, Duke.</i>

92
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,803
<i>Now you're going
to confess to it.</i>

93
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:20,263
Like hell I will.

94
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:21,806
<i>You will, Duke.</i>

95
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:24,559
<i>Because if you don't,
I'll be there.</i>

96
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:30,690
<i>I'll be there...
around every corner,</i>

97
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,109
<i>in every empty room.</i>

98
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,445
<i>As inevitable
as your guilty conscience.</i>

99
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,114
You don't scare me!

100
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:40,367
<i>You son of a...</i>

101
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,746
<i>You will go
to the 8th precinct house</i>

102
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:48,833
<i>on Second Avenue
and surrender yourself.</i>

103
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,209
<i>And you will do it now.</i>

104
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,921
I confess, I confess,
I'll do it, I'll do it!

105
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,633
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

106
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,635
I'll confess, for God's sake,
I don't want to die!

107
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:21,301
<i>Drive.</i>

108
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,390
Thank you.

109
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:29,225
You fellas are probably busy.

110
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:30,851
You can just drop me off
anywhere along...

111
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,478
<i>You're Doctor Roy Tam,</i>

112
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:36,023
a professor in the science
department at NYU.

113
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,108
Yes.

114
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:39,902
I've saved your life, Roy Tam.

115
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:42,238
It now belongs to me.

116
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:43,657
It does?

117
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:50,287
You'll become one of my agents.

118
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:53,499
Like dozens of others
all over the world.

119
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,169
Could, I, uh, ask
my wife about this?

120
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,131
No!

121
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,217
Mr. Shrevnitz here,
will instruct you

122
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:07,555
in the way I will contact you
should I require your help.

123
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:10,141
When you hear one
of my agents say,

124
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:12,144
"The sun is shining,"

125
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:17,982
you will respond,
"But the ice is slippery."

126
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:20,693
This will identify you
to each other.

127
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,278
Do you understand?

128
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,905
Th-the sun is shining.

129
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:27,492
But the ice is slippery.

130
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,454
Uh, tell me one thing...

131
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,998
How did you know
what was happening to me?

132
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:36,292
How did you know who I am?

133
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,967
The shadow knows.

134
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,573
Thank you.

135
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,033
That's the shadow.

136
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,826
I mean, that's the shadow.

137
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,453
Hey, you're a pretty smart guy.

138
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,497
Well, I heard rumors
in the paper, on the radio,

139
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:15,748
but I thought it was just talk.

140
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,333
I didn't think he existed.

141
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,294
He doesn't.
Get it?

142
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,300
Don't ever take it off.

143
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:27,885
Wait a minute.

144
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:29,637
Who are you?

145
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:32,640
Somebody who owes him his life.

146
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:35,101
Somebody just like you.

147
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,333
Boss, you okay?

148
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,212

162
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:34,386

accident on the bridge.

Well, I didn't think

Incidentally, try the, uh, prime rib.
It's excellent.

165
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:41,810
- You're usual, Mr. Cranston.
- Oh, yes.

166
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,606
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

167
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:48,693
You know, Lamont, I'm...
I'm very upset with you.

168
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:51,028
What is it this time?

169
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,656
<i>What is it this time?
What is it every time?</i>

170
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:56,241
<i>You ask me to dinner
and show up an hour late.</i>

171
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,910
<i>There's simply no excuse
for that kind of behavior.</i>

172
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,372
Uncle Wainwright,
I'm sorry, I, uh...

173
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,084
I got caught up.

174
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:08,212
<i>With what, for God sake?
You don't do anything.</i>

175
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:10,255
<i>A man your age is unseemly.</i>

176
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,925
<i>At least pick
a hobby or something.</i>

177
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,260
<i>Why am I talking
to the back of your neck?</i>

178
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,639
Lamont?
Lamont!

179
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,974
I'm sorry,
what were we talking about?

180
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,643
You know, I've never meddled
in your affairs.

181
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:25,688
Going back to the time that
after the war,

182
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,940
when you disappeared
for some seven years.

183
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,817
<i>I never asked any questions then.
I'm not asking any questions now.</i>

184
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,151
<i>Excuse me,
Police Commissioner Barth.</i>

185
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:34,571
- Urgent message for you, sir.
- Thank you.

186
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,824
What's the matter, cops and robbers
business slowing down?

187
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:37,784
Mm-mm.

188
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:42,497
It's a report of that damn
Shadow character again.

189
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,874
I thought you said
he was only a rumor.

190
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,626
I'm sick of the Shadow business...

191
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,586
his meddling in police affairs.

192
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:50,922
This time tomorrow...

193
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:53,925
I'll put a task force on him.

194
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,726
You're not going
to appoint a task force.

195
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,228
No, hell with him.

196
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:08,063
I'm not going
to appoint a task force.

197
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:12,443
You're not going to pay any attention
to these reports of the Shadow.

198
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:13,820
Ignore them entirely.

199
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,281
There is no Shadow.

200
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:18,699
No, there is no Shadow.

201
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,035
If there were,
I'd be Eleanor Roosevelt.

202
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:26,040
Mm, where was I?

203
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,252
You were about
to tell me who she is.

204
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:31,503
That's Margo Lane.

205
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,298
Her father's a scientist working
for the War Department.

206
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:37,050
What the hell do you see in her?

207
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:40,096
Uncle Wainwright, are you sure
you're not dead?

208
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,639
Not by a long shot.

209
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,855
<i>Do</i> yourself a favor...
stay away from her.

210
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:52,065
She's strange.

211
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,861
She hears voices.
That's what they say.

212
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:56,696
Really?

213
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:02,534
Yes, I would like a glass
of the Mouton...

214
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,120
Rothschild 1928.

215
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,163
Yes.

216
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:08,500
- From the gentleman.
- Gentleman?

217
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,920
Lamont Cranston.

218
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:14,047
May I sit?

219
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:27,184
You know...
it's the strangest thing,

220
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:32,357
but I have this sudden craving
for Peking duck.

221
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,943
That's so odd.

222
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,738
I was thinking
the exact same thing.

223
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:40,656
Care to join me?

224
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,124
You speak Chinese.

225
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,001
Only Mandarin.

226
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,380
Well, aren't you full
of surprises.

227
00:20:58,341 --> 00:20:59,842
Thank you.

228
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:01,885
I'm glad you like it.

229
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,555
Oh, I had it made,
uh, at Adrian's.

230
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:06,098
Why did you just tell me that?

231
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:11,144
Well, you just complemented
me on my dress just now.

232
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,565
- Didn't you?
- No, I didn't.

233
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,026
But I was thinking it.

234
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:22,489
Oh, now that hasn't happened
to me in a long, long time.

235
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,950
Since I was a little girl
with my cousin Harry,

236
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:26,159
I could hear
what he was thinking.

237
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,288
Just pick the thoughts right out
of his head before he said a word.

238
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,916
It was the strangest thing
and I never was able...

239
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:36,337
ls-is something bothering you?

240
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:41,341
Oh' no' no' no'.

241
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,553
<i>- Not at all.
- Oh.</i>

242
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:06,033
Well, thank you.
I had a wonderful time.

243
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:10,330
I'm not sure I can recall
an evening as... stimulating.

244
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:17,086
Good night Miss Lane.

245
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:19,923
Good night, Mr. Cranston.

246
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:29,723
<i>I like her, boss.</i>

247
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:32,059
She's different than
your usual dames.

248
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,102
More than even she knows.

249
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,479
<i>How's that?</i>

250
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,649
She has ability she's
completely unaware of.

251
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:40,067
No kidding?

252
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:41,235
You going to see her again?

253
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:44,363
No, it's much too dangerous.

254
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:46,239
Dangerous for who?

255
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,742
For me, Moe.

256
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:50,453
For me.

257
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:24,529
Someone's coming.

258
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:49,845
Well, what is it?

259
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:51,805
That's just it, sir,
I don't know.

260
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:55,142
Why, I would have labeled it a mummy
case, coming from Tibet like it did.

261
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:57,519
Mummy cases come
from Egypt, Berger.

262
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,022
Well, that's right, exactly.

263
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:02,399
Besides, the thing is metal, which made
me think it was a sarcophagus.

264
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,820
No, Tibetan sarcophagi
were of stone.

265
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:09,489
Uh, what happened to the truckman
who dropped it off?

266
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,366
Gone.

267
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,660
Well, it's obviously
an incorrect shipment.

268
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:16,080
Call our, uh,
customs broker and...

269
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,624
My God.

270
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,919
This is beautiful.

271
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:26,590
That is solid silver.

272
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:28,509
Nelson, help us take
the sides off.

273
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:44,357
<i>What does it say?</i>

274
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,901
<i>It's Latin.</i>

275
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:49,654
<i>Kha Khan,
dei potestas, in Terra.</i>

276
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:52,449
"The power of God on Earth,

277
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:56,662
the seal
of the Emperor of Mankind."

278
00:24:58,414 --> 00:24:59,624
Oh, my God.

279
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:03,503
Temujin.

280
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:09,508
This is the silver coffin
of Temujin.

281
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:11,802
Who's Temujin?

282
00:25:11,803 --> 00:25:15,556
The man who very nearly conquered
the globe eight centuries ago.

283
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:18,142
Well, how come
I never heard of him?

284
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:23,648
Temujin was the birth name...

285
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,819
of Genghis Khan.

286
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,530
What was the shipper's address?

287
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:34,282
It didn't say.

288
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:37,286
Label just had
the country of origin.

289
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:41,123
Let me make a telephone call.

290
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:43,543
Let me help you.

291
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:49,215
Nelson, whatever you do,
don't open it.

292
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,843
No, sir.

Yes, my Khan.

00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,053
Oh, my God.

310
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,097
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

311
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:46,225
<i>We were only gone for a moment.</i>

312
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,744
<i>You didn't hear me, did you?</i>

313
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:08,413
<i>I'm through
with the beryllium sphere.</i>

314
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:11,166
I'm just doing some underwater
tests to check pressure.

315
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:15,879
Farley, I have told you a dozen times
we are doing energy research.

316
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,215
I'm not interested in any military
application of the project.

317
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:21,259
Oh, yeah?

318
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,511
So, why do you let the War Department
pay all the bills?

319
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,014
'Cause you talked me into it.

320
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:27,933
I just wanted
enough money to finish.

321
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,270
Dr. Lane, you don't think big.

322
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:35,482
If you'd only listen to me,
the world could be our oyster.

323
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:37,275
Oysters?

324
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,320
I get a rash from oysters.

325
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:54,167
Oh, Margo.

326
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:56,879
What a beautiful dress.

327
00:29:57,797 --> 00:30:01,299
And such a clever neckline.

328
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,136
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Claymore,
I'd like to see my father.

329
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:08,057
So...

330
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:12,310
When are you going to come down
and see my beryllium sphere?

331
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:15,564
I'm not interested
in your spheres, Mr. Claymore.

332
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:24,990
Margo, you don't return
my calls anymore.

333
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,659
Well, that's not true.

334
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,829
I never did return your calls.

335
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:33,624
I know.
I can't imagine why.

336
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:39,130
It's because I don't like you.

337
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:46,720
What a fascinating woman.

338
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:51,724
Uh! Dad, I don't know how
you can work with that man.

339
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:55,104
Margo, what a nice surprise.
Hm?

340
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:57,522
Hi.

341
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,816
Hey, have you had your dinner?
Hm?

342
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:02,361
- Yes, dad, it's two a.m.
- Mm, mm.

343
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:05,405
Dad, where did you
get this shirt?

344
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:08,241
Mm, well, you said
I look good in green, hm?

345
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:12,579
No, this is green, that's red.

346
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,457
Mm, red, green, mm.

347
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:17,001
Well, to me
it's just a clean shirt.

348
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:23,798
<i>' Dad?
Hm?</i>

349
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,508
Do you believe in telepathy?

350
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:26,801
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

351
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:32,016
I mean, do you believe that it can
exist between certain people?

352
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:34,392
You mean mind reading?

353
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:37,062
Well, of course I don't, dear.
I'm a scientist.

354
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:40,316
So strange.

355
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:45,445
I've always had this feeling
that there was this...

356
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:48,781
indescribable connection
out there

357
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,743
just waiting for me.

358
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:55,456
<i>And suddenly tonight
there it was.</i>

359
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:57,583
Well, that's nice, dear.

360
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:00,044
What was it?

361
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:03,672
It was a man.

362
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:09,052
And I'm probably never
gonna see him again.

363
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:10,513
But why not?

364
00:32:11,222 --> 00:32:13,432
I just know.

365
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:19,021
It was as though I could sense
what he was feeling.

366
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:25,611
And now I'm completely
and utterly depressed.

367
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,405
Well, that's nice, dear.

368
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:36,080
Okay, that'll be four forty-five.

369
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:37,997
What are you doing?

370
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,832
Writin' down a drop-off point.

371
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:42,710
You're making a record
of my destination?

372
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,713
Taxi commission's rules.

373
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:55,099
All right, Reilly, back her up.

374
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:57,726
<i>That's it.</i>

375
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,272
You need fuel.

376
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:06,652
Jeez, I need gas.

377
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:09,655
Cut left, that's it.

378
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:11,615
Hey, thanks.

379
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:19,748
Look <i>out!</i>

380
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,460
This must be my lucky...

381
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,170
Well, what's going on?

382
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:09,213
Inspector Cardona's
in charge, sir.

383
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:10,883
He's, uh, over there.

384
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,345
Mm.

385
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,642
Well, I don't know
what to think.

386
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:18,218
Hey, what are you, crazy?

387
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:21,305
- Out.
- Thank you.

388
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,520
To The Sanctum.

389
00:36:39,156 --> 00:36:40,741
Go, go.

390
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:44,161
Come on, lady,
there's no parking there... come on.

391
00:36:53,754 --> 00:36:56,924
Hey, Louie,
save that cab for me!

392
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:45,805
Report.

393
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:50,561
Our agent in 26th precinct reports
police investigation of murder

394
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:53,062
<i>at the Museum
of Natural History.</i>

395
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:54,105
Murder?

396
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:56,191
Agent advises inquiry.

397
00:37:56,859 --> 00:37:58,193
Understood.

398
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:27,055
I saw you as taller.

399
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:28,806
Who are you?

400
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:33,270
Shiwan Khan, last descendent
of Genghis Khan.

401
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:37,940
You are naturally
deeply honored.

402
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:40,151
Don't feel obligated
to introduce yourself.

403
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:41,402
I already know who you are.

404
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:44,530
<i>Not this temporary version
of yourself.</i>

405
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:50,454
I know who you really are...
Ying Ko.

406
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:54,416
I'm a great admirer.

407
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:57,377
I don't know what
you're talking about.

408
00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:00,254
Please.

409
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:03,215
It is no more difficult for me
to invade your mind

410
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:05,385
than it was this room.

411
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:08,805
May I sit?

412
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,851
You are hurting
my feelings, Ying Ko.

413
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:17,271
I should have thought
you would enjoy to meet another

414
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:20,651
with the unique ability
to cloud men's minds.

415
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:23,653
You were a student
of the The Tulku?

416
00:39:23,654 --> 00:39:27,114
Yes, he spoke of you constantly.

417
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:31,119
But I'm afraid he wasn't able
to turn me quite as easily.

418
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:37,291
Hey, would you happen to have
some American Bourbon?

419
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,711
I have a bit of a taste for it.

420
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,004
<i>Hey, I'm happy to pay,
of course.</i>

421
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:44,508
No, no, not at all.

422
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,223
Say, you didn't happen,
by any chance,

423
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:53,684
to, uh...

424
00:39:54,977 --> 00:39:58,270
pay a visit to the Museum
last night, did you?

425
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:03,694
Mm, a wonderful collection
of Tibetan tapestries.

426
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:09,740
<i>Ah!</i>

427
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:13,829
Oh, Ying Ko, grown men
still shiver at your name.

428
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:19,583
You are, I have to confess,
my idol.

429
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:23,255
Your raid on the Village of Barga...
I studied it.

430
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,632
How nice, you remember it.

431
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,467
It rings a bell.

432
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:31,512
It was a master stroke.

433
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:34,516
Swift, vicious, and sudden!

434
00:40:36,518 --> 00:40:38,103
What genius.

435
00:40:39,021 --> 00:40:40,355
Uh-huh.

436
00:40:41,732 --> 00:40:43,775
So, uh, what brings you
to the Big Apple?

437
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:47,319
My destiny.

438
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:51,240
Genghis Khan conquer half
of the world in his lifetime.

439
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:53,744
I intend to finish the job.

440
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:56,621
And, uh, how do you plan
to do that?

441
00:40:57,456 --> 00:41:01,752
If I told you,
it wouldn't be a surprise.

442
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:06,297
I travelled to this country
in Genghis Khan's holy crypt

443
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:08,591
<i>to absorb his power.</i>

444
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:13,220
In three days
the entire world will hear my roar

445
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:17,601
and willingly fall subject
to the lost empire of Sianking.

446
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:22,271
That is a lovely tie,
by the way.

447
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:25,775
<i>- May I ask where you acquire it?
- Brooks Brothers.</i>

448
00:41:25,776 --> 00:41:27,193
Is that Midtown?

449
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:28,944
Forty-fifth and Madison.

450
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:30,947
You are a barbarian.

451
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:33,532
Thank you.

452
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:35,202
We both are.

453
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:39,830
I know that inside you
beats a heart of darkness.

454
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:43,417
You dip into it every time
you put on that hat and cloak.

455
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:44,585
Join me.

456
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:48,172
You are Ying Ko,
the Butcher of Lhasa.

457
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:53,470
You and only you deserve
to be by my side.

458
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:58,933
Together, we'll pit armies against
one another like a chess game.

459
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:03,605
We'll collect our due of pain
and we'll wash our hands in blood.

460
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:07,526
Your mouth still waters
at real power.

461
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:11,363
I am offering you a chance
to take it back.

462
00:42:12,114 --> 00:42:14,407
Be my partner, Ying Ko.

463
00:42:15,826 --> 00:42:18,869
- That's not my name anymore.
- But it is!

464
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,581
Nevertheless, still who you are.
Isn't it?

465
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:27,419
<i>For the bourbon.</i>

466
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,257
<i>We will meet again,</i> soon.

467
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:53,028
The day of the Mongol warrior

468
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:55,615
is once again at hand.

469
00:42:56,449 --> 00:43:00,911
Soon, with wings outstretched,

470
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:04,916
we fly to our destiny!

471
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:10,963
<i>Good morning,
Mr. and Mrs. America.</i>

472
00:43:10,964 --> 00:43:15,968
<i>Flash... Manhattan reels from yet
another report of the elusive Shadow.</i>

473
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:17,803
You know, I think they just
made up the Shadow

474
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:20,264
so people would listen
to the radio more.

475
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:22,308
What do you think, Roy?

476
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:25,019
<i>Some say
this Shadow is a foe...</i>

477
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,354
Hm?

478
00:43:27,397 --> 00:43:30,816
Oh, well, it...

479
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:33,028
I'll... I'll get it.

480
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:37,407
Yes.

481
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:40,911
The sun is shining.

482
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:44,539
But the ice is slippery.

483
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:49,919
You're an agent of the Shadow.

484
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,128
Who?

485
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:53,632
Oh, oh yeah, right.
Gotcha.

486
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:55,883
Wh... what do you need?

487
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:58,929
I need a metal analysis of this.

488
00:44:04,935 --> 00:44:06,311
Bronzium.

489
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:12,817
The metal is bronzium.

490
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:18,490
I didn't think it existed,
but, my God, here it is.

491
00:44:21,243 --> 00:44:23,786
The ancient Chinese believed
this was the very stuff

492
00:44:23,787 --> 00:44:25,914
the universe was formed of.

493
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:28,540
Where did it come from?

494
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:30,418
I'm told it came from Sianking.

495
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:35,297
If you believed in legends,
it had to be Sianking.

496
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:38,717
They called it the birthplace
of the world.

497
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:42,555
Could bronzium conceivably be used
to make some sort of a weapon?

498
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:46,559
Theoretically, yes.

499
00:44:47,477 --> 00:44:48,644
How?

500
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:52,564
Well, supposedly, it's very unstable
on the molecular level,

501
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:54,316
constantly given to expansion.

502
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:56,235
Only the cell bonds
hold it in check.

503
00:44:56,236 --> 00:44:57,736
But if the bonds were
ever breached...

504
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:59,488
By explosion?

505
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:01,031
It wouldn't do it.

506
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:04,910
But if the power of the cell
were to turn on itself in an implosion,

507
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:07,079
the molecular imbalance
will be released.

508
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,831
And then you'll have
your explosion all right.

509
00:45:08,832 --> 00:45:09,916
HOW big?

510
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:14,629
No man can say.

511
00:45:20,302 --> 00:45:22,219
The breakdown
would spread to all levels

512
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,097
of the cells'
atomic construction.

513
00:45:25,098 --> 00:45:27,892
Fashioned into a bomb,
it would be catastrophic.

514
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:32,229
I guess you'd call it
an implosive-explosive

515
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,606
submolecular device.

516
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:36,359
Or an atomic bomb.

517
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:39,446
Hey, that's catchy.

518
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:44,575
But it would have to have a beryllium
sphere to contain the apparatus.

519
00:45:44,576 --> 00:45:46,911
No other metal would
enhance a blast.

520
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:49,496
<i>In any case, it's all</i> moot.

521
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:51,207
None of this would be possible.

522
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:56,295
Unless some genius figures out

523
00:45:56,296 --> 00:45:59,049
how to design and make it.

524
00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:02,384
An implosive device.

525
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:04,511
It would have
to be put in a shell

526
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:09,601
with tiny implosive charges
regularly spread over the surface.

527
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:14,314
Something like this.

528
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:22,197
Fortunately,
such a device doesn't exist.

529
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:04,197
Reinhardt Lane.

530
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:28,805
<i>Reinhardt Lane.</i>

531
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:54,122
<i>Reinhardt Lane.</i>

532
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:44,839
<i>Reinhardt Lane.</i>

533
00:48:45,924 --> 00:48:47,717
Yes, my Khan.

534
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:54,139
You know something, Lamont,
that puzzles me?

535
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:58,227
How a man like yourself
who has absolutely nothing to do

536
00:48:58,228 --> 00:49:00,897
can be late
for every little engagement.

537
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:06,026
Practice, Uncle Wainwright.
Lots and lots of practice.

538
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:07,152
- Waiter?
- Mm.

539
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:09,947
Get me some more chives,
would you please and, uh...

540
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:12,074
Oh, my God, here comes
that Lane woman.

541
00:49:12,075 --> 00:49:14,076
Oh, please,
I don't need her anymore, I, oh...

542
00:49:14,077 --> 00:49:15,827
Hi, Miss Lane, how are you?

543
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:17,913
All right, you can drop the act,
Commissioner.

544
00:49:17,914 --> 00:49:19,581
What have you done
about my father?

545
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:22,417
<i>My secretary made it very clear.
There's nothing we can do unless...</i>

546
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:24,504
Unless what?
He blows himself up?

547
00:49:26,256 --> 00:49:29,592
Margo Lane,
my nephew Lamont Cranston.

548
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:31,843
Yes, we've met.

549
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:35,014
Would you, uh, care to join us?

550
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:42,271
Miss Lane, the fact that
your father is acting strangely,

551
00:49:42,272 --> 00:49:45,107
I don't think really calls
for a police investigation.

552
00:49:45,108 --> 00:49:46,316
Look, I just want to see him.

553
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:49,736
The War Department says he's suddenly
decided to take no visitors,

554
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:51,071
not even his own daughter.

555
00:49:51,072 --> 00:49:54,533
Well, chances are he's working
on some top secret.

556
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:56,493
It is a government project,
you know.

557
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,453
No, his project is harmless.

558
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:01,123
Energy research...
some kind of implosive device.

559
00:50:01,124 --> 00:50:02,749
<i>Look, I know something's wrong.</i>

560
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,002
<i>I spoke to him on the phone.</i>

561
00:50:04,586 --> 00:50:08,006
He was distant,
confused, babbling.

562
00:50:09,132 --> 00:50:11,551
He spoke to me in Chinese.

563
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:16,180
- Uh, wai... waiter.
- He doesn't even speak Chinese!

564
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:18,181
<i>I'm sorry, please.</i>

565
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:22,145
Tomorrow, I'll, uh, send a policeman
over to the Federal Building.

566
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:24,814
You'll see your father
and everything'll be fine, all right?

567
00:50:26,149 --> 00:50:27,859
What's your opinion, Mr. Cra...

568
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:32,280
Excuse me.

569
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:33,823
Mm?

570
00:50:37,994 --> 00:50:39,120
Thanks.

571
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:42,457
Lamont!

572
00:50:46,628 --> 00:50:48,211
Wait a second, Lamont.

573
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:50,131
I wanted to ask you
about my father.

574
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:53,259
I have to go.

575
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:56,012
Ying Ko.

576
00:50:56,638 --> 00:50:58,014
Who's Ying Ko?

577
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:01,768
Uh!

578
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:04,394
You will forget about me.

579
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:05,729
Why would I do that?

580
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,399
You will give me
no further thought.

581
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:11,652
Are you drunk?

582
00:51:11,653 --> 00:51:13,779
Look, Mr. Cranston, I don't know
what kind of woman

583
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:16,699
you're used to dealing with, but I
certainly don't appreciate being...

584
00:51:17,492 --> 00:51:18,784
Hey!

585
00:51:18,785 --> 00:51:20,410
Taxi, taxi!

586
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:22,037
The Federal Building.

587
00:51:22,038 --> 00:51:23,164
You got it, boss.

588
00:51:55,196 --> 00:51:56,405
Pizza?

589
00:51:56,406 --> 00:51:57,824
Yechh.

590
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:01,159
Well, I'm not going
to eat a burger again.

591
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,412
I'm not asking you
to eat a burger.

592
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:14,131
You like fish?

593
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:15,383
How about a burger?

594
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,761
Uh!

595
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:20,263
Uh!

596
00:53:21,157 --> 00:53:23,785
Next time you get to be on top.

597
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:17,272
Where is Khan?

598
00:55:17,273 --> 00:55:18,815
I will not tell you.

599
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:19,859
What are you doing?

600
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:23,069
Hold on or you'll die.

601
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,281
Yes, to serve my Khan.

602
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:30,578
I sense somebody's coming.

603
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:39,045
- Uh.
- Wooh!

604
00:55:47,303 --> 00:55:48,262
Drive.

605
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,025
Hello?

606
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:04,069
- Hello, Margo.
- Oh, Dad.

607
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:06,948
<i>- Are you all right?</i>
- <i>I'm</i> fine, dear.

608
00:56:07,782 --> 00:56:10,034
I need to see you right away.

609
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:12,744
At the lab.

610
00:56:12,745 --> 00:56:13,871
<i>Are you there now?</i>

611
00:56:15,373 --> 00:56:16,874
Hurry.

612
00:56:24,382 --> 00:56:27,468
Oh no, no, no.

613
00:56:32,765 --> 00:56:34,391
Oh, God.

614
00:56:34,392 --> 00:56:35,685
Dad!

615
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:38,813
Dad, where are you?

616
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:41,357
Oh, God, no.

617
00:56:57,456 --> 00:57:01,961
<i>Margo Lane.</i>

618
00:57:37,246 --> 00:57:40,041
I have a mission for you,
my dear.

619
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,902
Margo Lane.

620
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,737
What are you doing here?

621
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:54,405
You're in my home.

622
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:55,615
I am?
Your home?

623
00:58:55,616 --> 00:58:57,575
- What are you doing here?
- I don't know.

624
00:58:57,576 --> 00:59:01,913
- Who sent you?
- I don't know.

625
00:59:01,914 --> 00:59:04,290
There was a voice
over and over in my head.

626
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:06,252
It said I had
to kill the Shadow.

627
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:10,798
I want you to leave right now.

628
00:59:12,675 --> 00:59:14,926
I had to kill the Shadow
and I came here.

629
00:59:14,927 --> 00:59:17,388
I said I want you
to leave right now.

630
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:20,015
And there was only you.

631
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:22,309
Get out.

632
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:24,228
Let me see into your eyes.

633
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:29,065
You want to see into my eyes?

634
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:31,401
- I think I know something...
- Go ahead.

635
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:33,486
- I didn't before.
- Look at them.

636
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:36,030
- Look at them.
- There's something strange about you.

637
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:38,449
- I could feel it.
- But I've got to warn you,

638
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:41,119
- I could feel it.
- you won't like what you see.

639
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,580
Static in my head
whenever I was near you.

640
00:59:43,581 --> 00:59:47,710
I knew it.
You're the Shadow.

641
00:59:54,717 --> 00:59:56,426
My father's disappeared.

642
00:59:56,427 --> 00:59:58,888
<i>You're the only one
who can help me find him.</i>

643
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:02,766
Just be gone when I get back.

644
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:09,106
How do you know I won't tell
anyone who you really are?

645
01:00:11,317 --> 01:00:12,693
I know.

646
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:24,246
To The Sanctum.

647
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:22,448
Nice tie.

648
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:23,991
Thank you.

649
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:38,921
By the way, you sent
Margo Lane to kill me.

650
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:40,214
Kill you?

651
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:44,510
If I wanted you dead, Ying Ko,
I would have your liver on pole by now.

652
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:46,179
I sent a girl to be killed.

653
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:48,473
Tell me, how did you kill her?

654
01:02:48,474 --> 01:02:49,807
She's alive.

655
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:51,309
<i>And she's a danger to you.</i>

656
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:53,936
She now knows
exactly who you are.

657
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:55,813
How long will you let her live?

658
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:59,651
How long before
your pure instincts take over?

659
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:02,945
I'm onto your plan, Khan.

660
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:04,822
You still don't have
the beryllium sphere.

661
01:03:04,823 --> 01:03:06,783
And without it,
you can't complete the bomb.

662
01:03:06,784 --> 01:03:09,744
Besides, you know
I'm going to stop you.

663
01:03:09,745 --> 01:03:12,831
You American are so arrogant.

664
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:16,084
You think your meaningless,
decadent country

665
01:03:16,085 --> 01:03:18,669
is the new cradle
of civilization.

666
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:20,254
<i>- But let me tell you something.
- Hey.</i>

667
01:03:20,255 --> 01:03:22,507
That's the US of A
you're talking about, pal.

668
01:03:22,508 --> 01:03:25,135
I am talking
about ruling the world.

669
01:03:27,638 --> 01:03:29,305
I'd like to give you a name.

670
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:32,266
Leonard Levinski,
brilliant psychiatrist.

671
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:34,103
- You'll talk, he'll listen.
- You are boring me!

672
01:03:37,398 --> 01:03:39,107
Oh, that knife.

673
01:03:39,108 --> 01:03:40,525
<i>Recognize it.</i>

674
01:03:40,526 --> 01:03:42,069
<i>I took it from The Tulku.</i>

675
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:45,863
No, no, no, I correct myself.

676
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:50,869
I took it out of The Tulku
after I ran it through his heart.

677
01:03:52,538 --> 01:03:55,915
<i>When will you learn to listen
to your instincts?</i>

678
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:57,459
Instincts?

679
01:03:58,377 --> 01:04:00,087
I'll show you my instincts.

680
01:04:02,965 --> 01:04:04,758
<i>Never did master
the Phurba, did you?</i>

681
01:04:05,217 --> 01:04:08,095
Still expect it
to respond to brute force.

682
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:14,977
<i>My Mongol warrior
aren't terribly bright.</i>

683
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:18,355
But they are loyal.

684
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:20,606
<i>Accept the truth.</i>

685
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:22,900
There is no light
without shadow.

686
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:24,945
And you and I are their shadow.

687
01:04:26,697 --> 01:04:30,158
<i>I would sooner destroy
a Rembrandt than kill you.</i>

688
01:04:30,159 --> 01:04:33,828
<i>For the last time,
will you join me?</i>

689
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:37,498
<i>You cannot fool me.
You cannot defeat me.</i>

690
01:04:37,499 --> 01:04:39,208
Your mind is an open book to me.

691
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:41,295
Then learn how to read.

692
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:44,046
Uh!

693
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:45,215
Weakling.

694
01:04:55,976 --> 01:04:57,394
Ka Khan!

695
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:16,622
Tail 'em, Moe.

696
01:05:28,008 --> 01:05:29,760
He's disappeared, boss.

697
01:05:31,345 --> 01:05:32,304
Stop the car.

698
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:34,366
It's just an empty lot, boss.

699
01:07:26,793 --> 01:07:30,047
I can't help that I know
what I know about you.

700
01:07:34,843 --> 01:07:37,012
And I can't forget it either.

701
01:07:47,606 --> 01:07:48,982
It's late.

702
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:53,904
Sleep here if you like.
There are guest rooms.

703
01:07:57,032 --> 01:07:58,992
But in the morning
you should go.

704
01:08:03,997 --> 01:08:05,666
I'm not afraid of you.

705
01:08:16,968 --> 01:08:18,387
But I am.

706
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:29,981
<i>Lamont.</i>

707
01:08:36,113 --> 01:08:38,156
<i>Lamont.</i>

708
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:46,123
<i>Lamont.</i>

709
01:09:25,454 --> 01:09:26,413
Oh, my God.

710
01:09:43,597 --> 01:09:44,848
Good morning.

711
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:46,975
Good morning.

712
01:09:49,269 --> 01:09:52,355
Oh, God, I dreamed.

713
01:09:54,649 --> 01:09:56,026
So did I.

714
01:09:56,818 --> 01:09:57,778
What did you dream?

715
01:09:59,154 --> 01:10:02,740
I was lying naked on the beach
in the South Seas.

716
01:10:02,741 --> 01:10:05,702
<i>And the tide was
coming up over my toes.</i>

717
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:12,209
The sun was beating down.

718
01:10:13,502 --> 01:10:15,545
My skin was...

719
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:19,508
hot and cool at the same time.

720
01:10:23,178 --> 01:10:24,805
<i>It was wonderful.</i>

721
01:10:28,016 --> 01:10:29,309
What was yours?

722
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:32,269
I dreamed I tore
all the skin off my face

723
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:33,939
and was somebody else
underneath.

724
01:10:35,816 --> 01:10:37,025
You have problems.

725
01:10:38,318 --> 01:10:39,402
I'm aware of that.

726
01:10:41,071 --> 01:10:43,239
I'll wait for you outside
while you get dressed.

727
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,615
Oh, that's okay.

728
01:10:44,616 --> 01:10:45,951
You can stay.

729
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,162
Oh, these are all rumpled.

730
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:53,249
Uh, well, there might be some things
in here that you could use.

731
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:55,793
Uh, yeah.

732
01:10:55,794 --> 01:10:58,838
- This belonged to, uh, my Aunt Rose.
- Oh, really.

733
01:10:58,839 --> 01:11:00,422
Very fashionable gal, that Rose.

734
01:11:00,423 --> 01:11:03,717
- Mm-mm, kept her figure too.
- Ah, yeah.

735
01:11:03,718 --> 01:11:05,553
Well, I've gotta run.
I've got a, uh...

736
01:11:05,554 --> 01:11:06,972
<i>Taxi waiting downstairs?</i>

737
01:11:07,848 --> 01:11:09,014
Excuse me?

738
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:10,808
Oh, I just sensed that's what
you were going to say.

739
01:11:10,809 --> 01:11:12,017
It is, isn't it?

740
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:13,352
- Yes.
- Huh!

741
01:11:13,353 --> 01:11:16,188
Say this is getting easier
the more I'm around you.

742
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:18,190
You're like reading a book.

743
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:21,610
Well, thank you very much, Lamont,
but I won't be needing that taxi.

744
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:23,946
Whoa, yes, you do.
I have a very important...

745
01:11:23,947 --> 01:11:24,989
Oh, great, I'll come with you.

746
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:28,409
- Uh, no, last night we agreed...
- Uh, no, I didn't agree to anything.

747
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:31,287
Do you mind if I just get
one tiny little sentence out here?

748
01:11:31,288 --> 01:11:32,371
Thank you very much.

749
01:11:32,372 --> 01:11:34,748
Last night we both agreed that
you were going to leave this morning.

750
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:37,042
No, you agreed
I was going to leave.

751
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:39,712
I agreed to no such thing.
We need each other.

752
01:11:39,713 --> 01:11:41,547
- No we don't.
- We have a connection.

753
01:11:41,548 --> 01:11:42,590
No we don't.

754
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:44,341
Then how do you explain that
I can read your thoughts?

755
01:11:44,342 --> 01:11:46,176
- My thoughts are hard to miss.
- And why is that?

756
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:48,012
Psychically,
I'm very well endowed.

757
01:11:48,013 --> 01:11:50,306
I'll bet you are.

758
01:11:50,307 --> 01:11:52,892
Okay, so you don't need me,

759
01:11:52,893 --> 01:11:56,354
but I need you, Lamont,
to help me find my father.

760
01:11:57,647 --> 01:12:00,567
And I am coming with you.

761
01:12:01,735 --> 01:12:02,986
Okay.

762
01:12:04,195 --> 01:12:06,113
<i>Empire State Building pennants.</i>

763
01:12:06,114 --> 01:12:08,115
<i>Get your Empire State
Building pennants.</i>

764
01:12:08,116 --> 01:12:12,119
From there to there.

765
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,371
That is just the explosion.

766
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:18,585
The destruction
will be incalculable.

767
01:12:20,462 --> 01:12:21,712
Good.

768
01:12:21,713 --> 01:12:25,633
Ahh, what a beautiful day.

769
01:12:25,634 --> 01:12:28,511
Nice dress, toots.

770
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:59,875
- Come on along and listen to...
- Get me <i>down!</i>

771
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:01,627
Hey, Bobby, what the hell
are you doing?

772
01:13:01,628 --> 01:13:03,128
- I have no idea.
- No, don't do it.

773
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:04,172
Get me down.

774
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:06,298
Get me down from here.

775
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:09,218
The lullaby of Broadway.

776
01:13:09,219 --> 01:13:12,055
Get me down.
Get me down!

777
01:13:14,808 --> 01:13:17,351
<i>It's all falling
into place for me now.</i>

778
01:13:17,352 --> 01:13:20,230
Shiwan Khan needs a beryllium sphere
to complete the bomb.

779
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:23,440
I wonder where
he intends to find one.

780
01:13:23,441 --> 01:13:25,734
Beryllium sphere?
Beryllium sphere?

781
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:27,820
- Farley Claymore.
- What's that?

782
01:13:27,821 --> 01:13:30,114
Farley Claymore,
my father's assistant.

783
01:13:30,115 --> 01:13:32,282
He was working on a beryllium sphere,
I'm sure of it.

784
01:13:32,283 --> 01:13:35,035
- In your father's lab?
- No, no, he was working on his own.

785
01:13:35,036 --> 01:13:37,371
- Uh, Maritech Labs down on Southside.
- Good, very good.

786
01:13:37,372 --> 01:13:39,832
Do your sleeping at home, will ya?
Get out of the way!

787
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:41,250
Hey, I got something else
I want you to do for me.

788
01:13:41,251 --> 01:13:42,376
Of course, what?

789
01:13:42,377 --> 01:13:43,919
I was trailing Khan when
I suddenly lost him

790
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,921
on the corner of Second Avenue
and Houston Street.

791
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:47,589
There's something very strange
about that corner.

792
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:50,259
It's a vacant lot now, but I want
you to find out what used to be there.

793
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:51,635
Second and Houston.

794
01:13:51,636 --> 01:13:53,512
What about Farley Claymore?

795
01:13:53,513 --> 01:13:56,390
Mr. Claymore's gonna
receive a little visit

796
01:13:56,391 --> 01:13:57,809
from the Shadow.

797
01:14:12,282 --> 01:14:14,033
<i>Farley Claymore.</i>

798
01:14:14,034 --> 01:14:15,743
Who's that?

799
01:14:15,744 --> 01:14:18,370
<i>Where is the beryllium sphere,
Claymore?</i>

800
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:19,497
sphere?

801
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:23,042
What sphere?

802
01:14:23,043 --> 01:14:26,003
<i>Claymore, you idiot!</i>

803
01:14:26,004 --> 01:14:28,088
<i>You're being manipulated.</i>

804
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:31,592
<i>Your mind is being controlled
by hypnosis.</i>

805
01:14:31,593 --> 01:14:33,635
My mind?

806
01:14:33,636 --> 01:14:35,012
Controlled?

807
01:14:35,013 --> 01:14:37,431
<i>Claymore, what have you done
with the sphere?</i>

808
01:14:37,432 --> 01:14:40,601
It's too late.
I loaded it on a truck.

809
01:14:40,602 --> 01:14:42,228
<i>Take me to it now!</i>

810
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:56,993
<i>Who do you think you're gonna shoot
with that, Claymore?</i>

811
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:04,751
<i>Uh!</i>

812
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:13,675
No one controls my mind, Shadow!

813
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:16,386
There's a new
world order coming.

814
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:18,597
And I'm gonna be a king.

815
01:15:18,598 --> 01:15:20,016
A king!

816
01:16:24,664 --> 01:16:25,832
<i>Margo.</i>

817
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:30,127
<i>Margo, I need you.</i>

818
01:18:03,596 --> 01:18:05,014
You called?

819
01:18:14,065 --> 01:18:15,233
Lamont?

820
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,551
You are not supposed to be here.

821
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:08,328
<i>Lamont?</i>

822
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:10,705
Lamont.

823
01:19:18,212 --> 01:19:19,547
You were dreaming.

824
01:19:27,096 --> 01:19:28,306
You saw.

825
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:37,190
Do you have any idea

826
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:40,525
what it's like
to have done things

827
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:43,237
you can never
forgive yourself for?

828
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:49,911
Lamont...

829
01:19:54,207 --> 01:19:56,084
whoever you were,

830
01:19:57,251 --> 01:19:59,045
whatever you did...

831
01:20:01,881 --> 01:20:03,674
it's in the past.

832
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:07,845
Not for me, Margo.

833
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:11,808
Never for me.

834
01:20:18,606 --> 01:20:21,526
We are victorious.

835
01:20:22,902 --> 01:20:27,865
And as victors, we will collect
the spoils of war.

836
01:20:28,658 --> 01:20:31,327
I will remember each of you.

837
01:20:32,662 --> 01:20:36,289
Particularly my special servant.

838
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:39,418
The only American
with genius enough

839
01:20:39,419 --> 01:20:42,754
to join me of his own free will.

840
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:44,674
Khan.

841
01:20:47,051 --> 01:20:51,346
Who saw himself
a king in my kingdom.

842
01:20:51,347 --> 01:20:54,434
King?
Did Is ay king?

843
01:20:55,685 --> 01:20:57,894
Maybe not the best
choice of words.

844
01:20:57,895 --> 01:20:59,938
No, it wasn't.

845
01:20:59,939 --> 01:21:02,108
Because actually
I was thinking prince, tops.

846
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:06,779
Not even necessarily.
Uh, duke, baron?

847
01:21:07,655 --> 01:21:09,365
You're choice, of course.
Your choice.

848
01:21:11,576 --> 01:21:13,743
Get Dr. Lane.
Assemble the bomb!

849
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:14,786
Of course.

850
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:17,331
In the name of the new Kha Khan.

851
01:21:18,458 --> 01:21:21,334
The power of God on Earth.

852
01:21:21,335 --> 01:21:25,131
The Emperor of Mankind.

853
01:21:38,102 --> 01:21:40,812
Extra, extra, read all about it.

854
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:43,274
Madman threatens
to blow the city sky-high.

855
01:21:46,194 --> 01:21:49,613
Residents of New York City were
thrown into a virtual panic today.

856
01:21:49,614 --> 01:21:53,366
<i>Police were still trying to determine
if, in fact, the threat was real</i>

857
01:21:53,367 --> 01:21:55,410
<i>or merely an incredible hoax.</i>

858
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:58,247
Either way,
surely the work of a madman.

859
01:22:08,007 --> 01:22:09,175
Morning, Russell.

860
01:22:14,305 --> 01:22:19,227
He's demanded works of art,
famous jewels, even gold.

861
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:23,480
Find Khan and you'll find
the bomb, I bet.

862
01:22:23,481 --> 01:22:25,482
What did you find out
about that vacant lot?

863
01:22:25,483 --> 01:22:26,816
Not much, I'm afraid.

864
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:29,027
It was the site
of the old Hotel Monolith.

865
01:22:29,028 --> 01:22:32,531
It was finished nearly ten years ago,
but it never opened.

866
01:22:32,532 --> 01:22:35,784
The Monolith.
I vaguely remember that.

867
01:22:35,785 --> 01:22:38,703
Seems that's the only way
anybody remembers it.

868
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:40,747
Before the hotel was completed,

869
01:22:40,748 --> 01:22:44,501
the developer went bankrupt
and committed suicide.

870
01:22:44,502 --> 01:22:46,211
Ah.

871
01:22:46,212 --> 01:22:51,216
The, uh, last record is a sale
to a Far Eastern buyer

872
01:22:51,217 --> 01:22:52,510
six years ago.

873
01:22:53,302 --> 01:22:54,553
When was it torn down?

874
01:22:54,554 --> 01:22:55,887
It doesn't say.

875
01:22:55,888 --> 01:22:59,307
I made some calls this morning
to newspapers and such.

876
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:03,061
All anybody can remember is
up to the time it was sold.

877
01:23:03,062 --> 01:23:05,605
Everyone seems
to know that it was torn down,

878
01:23:05,606 --> 01:23:10,026
but they can't remember
when or by whom.

879
01:23:10,027 --> 01:23:11,571
Or if.

880
01:23:30,298 --> 01:23:31,924
I can't believe he did it.

881
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:34,092
Did what?

882
01:23:34,093 --> 01:23:35,052
Lamont?

883
01:23:36,012 --> 01:23:38,014
My God.

884
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:56,991
It's beautiful.

885
01:23:57,742 --> 01:23:58,868
What is?

886
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:01,411
Hey, hey, fella.

887
01:24:01,412 --> 01:24:03,456
That building right there,
what's the name of that building?

888
01:24:04,999 --> 01:24:06,625
<i>Lunatic.</i>

889
01:24:06,626 --> 01:24:11,088
Shiwan Khan has
hypnotized the entire city!

890
01:24:15,593 --> 01:24:16,844
They don't see it.

891
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:22,475
None of them see it.

892
01:24:25,269 --> 01:24:26,729
But I see it.

893
01:24:28,564 --> 01:24:30,690
You and Shrevnitz
will receive your instructions.

894
01:24:30,691 --> 01:24:32,776
I want you
to follow them exactly.

895
01:24:32,777 --> 01:24:33,736
Lamont.

896
01:24:43,079 --> 01:24:46,498
Bet you wish you'd been a little nicer
to me now, huh, don't ya?

897
01:24:46,499 --> 01:24:49,668
Bet you wish you'd listened
to my ideas?

898
01:24:49,669 --> 01:24:51,670
Bet you didn't count
on me being friends

899
01:24:51,671 --> 01:24:53,380
with a conqueror,
huh, did ya, did ya?

900
01:24:53,381 --> 01:24:55,715
Hey, that's enough.

901
01:24:55,716 --> 01:24:57,259
Activate the bomb.

902
01:25:04,809 --> 01:25:07,144
Set the timer for two hours.

903
01:25:15,736 --> 01:25:17,987
You are certain
you could duplicate

904
01:25:17,988 --> 01:25:20,490
this bomb's design
any time I require?

905
01:25:20,491 --> 01:25:22,284
Absolutely, no problem.

906
01:25:23,327 --> 01:25:25,912
That makes Dr. Lane obsolete.

907
01:25:25,913 --> 01:25:27,747
Secure him in a room.

908
01:25:27,748 --> 01:25:30,625
He'll die at the hands
of his own invention.

909
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:32,336
Yes, my Khan.

910
01:25:33,003 --> 01:25:36,256
Listen, I know
you must have this covered,

911
01:25:36,257 --> 01:25:39,050
but shouldn't we be
getting out of here too?

912
01:25:39,051 --> 01:25:42,512
There's an aeroplane waiting
to take us all to safety.

913
01:25:42,513 --> 01:25:43,931
<i>We leave in one hour.</i>

914
01:26:31,937 --> 01:26:33,439
What is it, Moe?

915
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:39,736
<i>Is it another one of those things
from the bowling league?</i>

916
01:26:39,737 --> 01:26:40,946
Mm-hm.

917
01:27:06,305 --> 01:27:07,848
" Uh!
" Uh!

918
01:27:45,678 --> 01:27:47,054
Ying Ko.

919
01:27:48,138 --> 01:27:49,597
The Shadow.

920
01:27:49,598 --> 01:27:50,807
Where?

921
01:27:50,808 --> 01:27:53,977
Not here, you idiot.
In the building.

922
01:27:53,978 --> 01:27:55,771
Can you tell if he's mad at me?

923
01:27:56,939 --> 01:27:59,774
We had a little
misunderstanding yesterday

924
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:02,528
and there might
still be hard feelings.

925
01:28:04,363 --> 01:28:06,115
Find him and kill him!

926
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:07,866
Kill him?

927
01:28:07,867 --> 01:28:09,743
- Me?
- All of you!

928
01:28:12,746 --> 01:28:15,623
Couldn't I just stay here
and help you?

929
01:28:15,624 --> 01:28:16,584
Go!

930
01:28:35,519 --> 01:28:37,438
You guys go that way.

931
01:29:12,097 --> 01:29:15,558
<i>Did you think you'd
never see me again, Claymore?</i>

932
01:29:19,438 --> 01:29:20,648
<i>I'm right here.</i>

933
01:29:24,193 --> 01:29:26,403
<i>All around you.</i>

934
01:29:27,821 --> 01:29:30,074
<i>Everywhere around you.</i>

935
01:29:48,425 --> 01:29:50,803
Coward!

936
01:29:51,929 --> 01:29:54,473
Chicken, sissy!

937
01:29:55,516 --> 01:29:58,727
Come out here
and fight like a man!

938
01:30:29,466 --> 01:30:31,552
You're a fool, Claymore.

939
01:30:33,429 --> 01:30:35,222
Get out of my sight!

940
01:30:45,232 --> 01:30:47,359
<i>There's your exit, Claymore.</i>

941
01:31:05,627 --> 01:31:07,796
You know what I love
about this job?

942
01:31:09,089 --> 01:31:10,632
The excitement.

943
01:31:21,769 --> 01:31:24,270
Ah, Ying Ko, I surrender.

944
01:31:24,271 --> 01:31:26,315
You're finished, Khan.

945
01:31:47,586 --> 01:31:48,587
Uh!

946
01:31:54,134 --> 01:31:55,427
Phurba.

947
01:32:23,664 --> 01:32:26,415
<i>You are losing
your concentration.</i>

948
01:32:26,416 --> 01:32:29,627
<i>Your mind is too weak.</i>

949
01:32:29,628 --> 01:32:32,797
<i>You are beginning
to lose your power.</i>

950
01:32:51,733 --> 01:32:53,026
Look at you.

951
01:32:54,153 --> 01:32:56,279
Can't even control yourself.

952
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:58,240
<i>How can you hope
to control Phurba?</i>

953
01:33:29,479 --> 01:33:30,856
Stop!

954
01:33:45,787 --> 01:33:47,371
My God.

955
01:33:47,372 --> 01:33:49,166
That's what he saw.

956
01:33:57,424 --> 01:33:58,717
Mm.

957
01:34:00,385 --> 01:34:01,345
Where am I?

958
01:34:07,059 --> 01:34:09,269
Ka Khan!

959
01:34:48,308 --> 01:34:49,476
Khan!

960
01:35:04,741 --> 01:35:06,659
- Dad.
- Margo.

961
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:09,829
- Oh, are you all right?
- Where am I?

962
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:11,539
What is going on here?

963
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:14,667
- Well, there's this guy...
- Mm-hm.

964
01:35:14,668 --> 01:35:16,127
I'll tell you later.

965
01:35:16,128 --> 01:35:17,337
- Moe, go call the police.
- Okay.

966
01:35:28,932 --> 01:35:30,850
<i>Look, there it is.</i>

967
01:35:30,851 --> 01:35:32,601
Oh, my God!

968
01:35:32,602 --> 01:35:35,104
Oh, this is impressive work.

969
01:35:35,105 --> 01:35:36,897
Who did this?

970
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:40,152
You did.
We only have an hour left.

971
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:41,570
Disconnect it.

972
01:35:48,201 --> 01:35:50,203
Hm, cut this off.

973
01:35:50,746 --> 01:35:51,871
Oh.

974
01:35:51,872 --> 01:35:53,998
Dad, the timer...
You gotta stop it.

975
01:35:53,999 --> 01:35:55,375
Oh dear.

976
01:35:56,293 --> 01:35:57,461
Hah!

977
01:36:01,256 --> 01:36:02,674
<i>Two minutes left.</i>

978
01:36:14,895 --> 01:36:17,064
Oh, my God, hurry.
Hurry, Dad.

979
01:36:22,277 --> 01:36:23,403
This way.

980
01:36:29,242 --> 01:36:31,453
Oh, my God, it's upstairs.

981
01:36:41,713 --> 01:36:43,256
<i>Oh, no, the elevator!</i>

982
01:36:52,974 --> 01:36:54,267
Be careful.

983
01:37:08,365 --> 01:37:09,698
Which wire?

984
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:11,617
I don't remember.
I just don't remember.

985
01:37:11,618 --> 01:37:12,744
Pick one!

986
01:37:14,079 --> 01:37:16,748
Oh, well, what the hell,
it's usually green.

987
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:20,293
No, green!

988
01:37:22,129 --> 01:37:23,213
This is green.

989
01:37:24,297 --> 01:37:25,673
That's red.

990
01:37:25,674 --> 01:37:27,675
I've gotta try to remember that.

991
01:37:27,676 --> 01:37:28,844
Oh.

992
01:37:41,022 --> 01:37:42,231
What are you doing?

993
01:38:32,699 --> 01:38:35,285
<i>Where the hell
did that come from?</i>

994
01:38:55,722 --> 01:38:57,015
What is this?

995
01:39:01,269 --> 01:39:03,480
Where am I, huh?

996
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:07,484
You, come here.

997
01:39:09,444 --> 01:39:10,529
Look at me.

998
01:39:16,284 --> 01:39:18,328
Look into my eyes.

999
01:39:21,915 --> 01:39:23,792
Yes.

1000
01:39:25,585 --> 01:39:27,003
Release me at once.

1001
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:31,632
No, we won't have
any of that, Mr. Khan.

1002
01:39:31,633 --> 01:39:33,760
Let's just have a look
at those stitches, shall we?

1003
01:39:34,052 --> 01:39:35,970
Stitches.

1004
01:39:35,971 --> 01:39:37,763
What... what have you done?

1005
01:39:37,764 --> 01:39:39,515
Saved your life, that's what.

1006
01:39:39,516 --> 01:39:42,142
Of course, we had to remove
a little section of your frontal lobe.

1007
01:39:42,143 --> 01:39:43,852
But you'll never miss it,
believe me.

1008
01:39:43,853 --> 01:39:45,521
It's a part nobody ever uses.

1009
01:39:45,522 --> 01:39:46,690
But... huh?

1010
01:39:48,441 --> 01:39:51,277
Unless you believe
in telepathy.

1011
01:39:51,278 --> 01:39:52,821
Wait!
Come back here!

1012
01:39:53,530 --> 01:39:55,115
You, come here!

1013
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:59,702
I am Shiwan Khan, the last
descendant of Genghis Khan!

1014
01:39:59,703 --> 01:40:01,245
Listen to me!

1015
01:40:01,246 --> 01:40:02,746
<i>I'm Houdini!</i>

1016
01:40:02,747 --> 01:40:04,707
I am Theodore Roosevelt.

1017
01:40:04,708 --> 01:40:06,333
I am Napoleon.

1018
01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:08,085
<i>I'm Josephine.</i>

1019
01:40:08,086 --> 01:40:09,878
<i>I'm Babe Ruth.</i>

1020
01:40:28,648 --> 01:40:29,858
I'll see you later.

1021
01:40:34,696 --> 01:40:36,906
Hey, how will you know
where I am?

1022
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:41,536
I'll know.
