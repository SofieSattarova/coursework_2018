1
00:01:52,822 --> 00:01:54,532
<i>People will say I am a monster...</i>

2
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,367
<i>...for what I've done.</i>

3
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,036
<i>And maybe they're right.</i>

4
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,541
<i>I always thought that I'd have more...</i>

5
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,835
<i>- ...time.
- Dad?</i>

6
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,586
Dad!

7
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:08,838
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

8
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:11,716
Peter?

9
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,983
<i>He likes to sleep
with the light on at night.</i>

10
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:30,735
Mary, we have to go.

11
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:35,656
Dad.

12
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:40,119
Be good.

13
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:52,506
I found a safe place for us
to spend the night at Lake Geneva.

14
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:56,719
- Are you uploading it?
- To Roosevelt. All of it.

15
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,596
Just in case we...

16
00:03:00,765 --> 00:03:02,099
We're gonna be fine, Mary.

17
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,769
Did you see his face?
He's never gonna understand.

18
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:06,645
Mary, we've been through this.

19
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,690
Our life as we know it is over.

20
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:13,486
We're gonna spend every day from now
on looking over our shoulders.

21
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,655
Never feeling safe.
We can't do that to him.

22
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,657
He's just a little boy.

23
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:20,743
I know, I know. But it's gonna be okay.

24
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:24,288
It's gonna be all right.

25
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,013
No rest for the weary, huh?

26
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,224
No, I'm afraid not.

27
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,518
Occupational hazard, I guess.

28
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:48,562
What is it you're working on?

29
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:55,319
Just planning ahead. Do you think
I could speak with the pilot?

30
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:57,446
Something you need?

31
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,740
Perhaps I can help.

32
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,367
I'd just like to radio ahead...

33
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:04,036
...and make sure everything's
in order for when we land.

34
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,792
I think we both know that's not
an option, Dr. Parker.

35
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:27,768
- Richard.
- They say you're a genius.

36
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:28,853
Richard!

37
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,522
Not if you thought you could escape.

38
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,356
Richard!

39
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:34,650
Mary!

40
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,416
Mary!

41
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,553
Mare.

42
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,139
It's okay. It's okay. That's okay.
It's okay.

43
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,559
I got you. I have you, okay? Okay?

44
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:10,186
Just gonna make you safe.

45
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:12,897
It's done. It's done.
Can you breathe? Mare?

46
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:15,774
- Roosevelt.
- What?

47
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:17,109
Roosevelt.

48
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:28,537
It's back up. It's back up.

49
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,290
It's back up, okay? Hey, hey, hey.

50
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,751
We're gonna be all right, okay?
You stay with me.

51
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:46,258
What do you got for me today, New York?

52
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,302
<i>Reporting live from New York 1 chopper.</i>

53
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:51,889
<i>An Oscorp truck carrying
plutonium has been hijacked.</i>

54
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,932
<i>A police chase is in progress.</i>

55
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:55,559
All right. Let's get to work.

56
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,775
Say hello to Aleksei Sytsevich!

57
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,181
Spider-Man!

58
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:35,974
Hello, pedestrians.

59
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,828
Knock, knock.

60
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:57,830
Mr. Criminal?

61
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,331
Hey, my name is Spider-Man.

62
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,458
You can call me Web-Head,
you can call me Amazing...

63
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:03,711
...just don't call me late for dinner.
You get it?

64
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,715
Not a shaker? Are you a hugger?

65
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:10,384
- I am killer!
- Whoa, okay.

66
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:13,512
<i>Warning. Plutonium-238
is a radioactive material...</i>

67
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,347
<i>...and is highly explosive.</i>

68
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,182
Excuse me.

69
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,476
There's more room
on the sidewalk, folks, please.

70
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:21,520
- Watch it, man.
- I got blueprints here.

71
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,813
A little help?

72
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:25,190
A little help, please.

73
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,027
You having a problem with your gun?

74
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:30,529
Let me help you out with that.

75
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:32,197
Coming through.

76
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,534
Too much work...

77
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,245
Oh, this is bad.

78
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,705
I'm gonna be right back.

79
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,252
Heads up. Watch out.

80
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,798
Okay. Okay. There you go.

81
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,801
- You okay? You all right?
- You're Spider-Man.

82
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,345
Costume gives it away?
These look pretty important, Max.

83
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,431
"Max"? How do you know my name?

84
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:58,849
It's written on your badge.

85
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,100
I'm a nobody.

86
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,561
Hey, you're not a nobody.
You're a somebody.

87
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:03,479
Lick that.

88
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,063
All right. Listen to me.

89
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:06,356
- Now I need you.
- Really?

90
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,066
- You're my eyes and ears out here.
- Okay.

91
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:09,234
- All right?
- All right.

92
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:10,611
I'll see you out there.

93
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:14,865
<i>Warning. Violation of protocol.</i>

94
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:46,647
Hands up!

95
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,903
Get him, Spidey!

96
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,116
Gotcha. Gotcha. Nope. Got you too.

97
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,622
Hey. No. You.
You're not going anywhere.

98
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,374
Come here. Come here.
Come to Daddy.

99
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,962
Get the hell out of the way!

100
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:11,880
Okay. Stop it! Stop it!

101
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,425
Oh, come on.

102
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:18,595
Hey, wait. Come back here.

103
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:21,139
Heel!

104
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,724
I got you.

105
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,823
Hey, I'm sorry, I'm running a bit late.
I got stuck in some traffic.

106
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,867
Your timing is terrible.
It started already.

107
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:41,451
- <i>I know, I'm sorry.</i>
- Where are you?

108
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:43,412
<i>1st and Broadway, 2nd and Broadway,
3rd and Broadway.</i>

109
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,247
Five minutes. Ten tops.

110
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,208
- Are those sirens?
- <i>No.</i>

111
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,501
- Peter?
- <i>No.</i>

112
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,253
- Peter?
- <i>No sirens.</i>

113
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:52,921
No...

114
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:54,715
<i>Peter.</i>

115
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,508
<i>What is happening?</i>

116
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:57,885
<i>Peter.</i>

117
00:11:58,385 --> 00:11:59,469
<i>Peter.</i>

118
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:05,767
<i>Hello?</i>

119
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,230
- Peter? Pe...
- <i>I'll be right there. Promise.</i>

120
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,902
This year's valedictorian,
please welcome Gwen Stacy.

121
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,084
Good morning, esteemed faculty...

122
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:33,211
...and families of my fellow graduates.

123
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,672
It's an honor to be
standing up here today.

124
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:43,847
Hello.

125
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,515
- Hey! Get off!
- I told you.

126
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,559
I am running a bit late.

127
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,394
It's over, Spider.

128
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:50,646
Really?!

129
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:52,856
I know we all think that we're immortal.

130
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,733
We're supposed to feel that way.

131
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,068
We're graduating.

132
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,988
<i>But, like our brief four
years in high school...</i>

133
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,491
...what makes life valuable...

134
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,868
<i>...is that it doesn't last forever.</i>

135
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,537
What makes it precious is that it ends.

136
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,582
<i>And I know that now more than ever.</i>

137
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,627
<i>And I say it...</i>

138
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:16,380
<i>...today of all days...</i>

139
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:19,257
...to remind us that time is luck.

140
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,556
<i>So don't waste it living
someone else's life.</i>

141
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,476
Make yours count for something.

142
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,853
Fight for what matters to you.

143
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:33,355
No matter what.

144
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,983
Because even if we fall short...

145
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,986
...what better way is there to live?

146
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,583
I'll take that. That's not yours.

147
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,552
This is not end, Spider!

148
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,099
Michael Oates.

149
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,437
Julia Orchard-Heymans.

150
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:18,066
Alexis Ortiz.

151
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,031
Bo Parisi.

152
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,118
Peter Parker.

153
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,495
Hey, I think I know that guy.

154
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:31,913
Peter Park...

155
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:36,710
I'm sorry.

156
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,431
Wait, do that again. Do that again.

157
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:55,103
Peter, for Lord's sakes, I almost stole
a cap and gown to run up there myself.

158
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,523
I'd love to have seen that. That would've
been awesome. No, no, this is for you.

159
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,525
- I am so proud of you.
- You earned it.

160
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:03,153
Sweetheart, I'm so proud of you.

161
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,989
I know the first thing your
Uncle Ben would say.

162
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,240
Yeah, I know too.

163
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:10,619
"You better hurry up, party's over.
You gotta get a job."

164
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:12,037
The second thing he would say:

165
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,956
"Don't just follow the path,
make your own trail."

166
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:16,458
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

167
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,251
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

168
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:20,462
Ben told me he made it up.

169
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:24,299
You really did learn something here.

170
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:29,846
I wish your uncle could have been here.

171
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,266
Yeah, me too.

172
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:35,435
And my folks.

173
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,396
Yeah. Yeah.

174
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,193
- Would've been good.
- Perfect d...

175
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,946
All right, you can go. Go on.

176
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:47,197
I'll be right back.

177
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,033
- Is that your programme?
- Okay, guys. Get together right now.

178
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,911
A quick one. All right. Cheese.

179
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,746
- Cheese.
- Cheese.

180
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:57,916
- Okay. I'll just be over here.
- Yeah, just give me two seconds.

181
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,751
- Don't go too far.
- It's good to see you.

182
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,461
- All right.
- All right.

183
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:03,338
Hey.

184
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,591
Did your traffic jam have anything
to do with the Russian Mob...

185
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,805
...and machine guns by any chance?
Why didn't you just tell me?

186
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,057
What am I gonna do?
You're about to do your speech.

187
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,017
- Gwen. Honey. Family photo.
- Yes?

188
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:17,102
Okay.

189
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,271
Hey. You coming to dim sum?

190
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,273
Can't keep me away.

191
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:22,858
It's at 8:00. Don't be late.

192
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:24,317
- I won't be.
- Okay.

193
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,905
And I'm gonna do my speech for you.

194
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,366
All night? I wanna hear it all night long.

195
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,660
- Over and over again, all night long.
- Okay.

196
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,579
- Oh, my gosh.
- It was pretty good.

197
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,790
Great. Peter. Join us? Come on.

198
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:44,588
I gotta find my aunt, but I'm
gonna catch up later, thank you.

199
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,673
Hi.

200
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:51,261
<i>You're gonna make enemies.</i>

201
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,305
<i>People will get hurt.</i>

202
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,225
<i>So I want you to promise me
something, okay?</i>

203
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:01,354
Leave Gwen out of it.

204
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,108
<i>Promise me that.</i>

205
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,069
She's gonna take one quick picture, okay?

206
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,251
Peter's outside.
I'm gonna go see if he's okay.

207
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:27,214
What are you doing? What are you...?

208
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:30,675
Peter.

209
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:34,846
What is it?

210
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,391
- Hey.
- What's wrong?

211
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:39,726
Are you all right?

212
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,353
I don't know what I'm doing.

213
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,523
It's my father, isn't it?

214
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,192
Yeah.

215
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:49,486
I see him everywhere I go.

216
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:54,282
I can't... I don't know what to do.
And I can't get him out of my head.

217
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,327
- Yeah, but we've talked about this.
- I know, but, Gwen...

218
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,454
- It's not his choice.
- Gwen.

219
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:03,625
I promised him that I would
keep away from you.

220
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,878
And now I'm gonna come and
eat dinner with your family.

221
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:10,257
How can I do this?
What does this make me?

222
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,759
I don't know, what does that make you?

223
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,387
It makes me not able to live with myself.

224
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:22,269
- I thought that it meant you loved me.
- I do love you.

225
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,647
I love you.

226
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,109
Then why isn't that enough?

227
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,946
Because what if something
happens to you...

228
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:35,699
...just like it happened
to him because of me?

229
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:39,119
- No, wait, wait, wait.
- Listen. No, n...

230
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:41,037
I cannot let that happen.

231
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:42,914
Listen to me.

232
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,833
You're Spider-Man...

233
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:47,627
...and I love that.

234
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:52,173
But I love Peter Parker more.

235
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,803
That's worth it to me.

236
00:18:58,013 --> 00:18:59,889
I can't lose you too.

237
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,811
If because you can't lose me,
we can't be together...

238
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,399
...who does that work out for, Peter?

239
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,820
I can't. I'm sorry, Gwen.

240
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:21,119
You have done this to me...

241
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:25,832
...again and again, Peter.

242
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,335
I can't live like this.

243
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,422
I break up with you.

244
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,926
I break up with you.

245
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,426
<i>Good morning, New Yorkers.</i>

246
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,012
<i>Looking for another beautiful
day here in the city.</i>

247
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,555
<i>A few clouds to start us off...</i>

248
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:26,059
<i>The steady increase in sightings
of Spider-Man has sparked a debate...</i>

249
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,686
<i>...over the role of vigilantism
in American crime fighting.</i>

250
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:29,938
<i>How about that Spider-Man?</i>

251
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,565
<i>Last night on the Manhattan Bridge,
he saved a dozen lives.</i>

252
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:34,401
<i>We wanna hear your calls.</i>

253
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,987
<i>I think without Spider-Man,
there'd be no hope for this city.</i>

254
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:41,366
<i>Who do you think pays the bills
for all the damages he causes, huh?</i>

255
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:42,700
<i>It's you and me, taxpayers.</i>

256
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,494
- You make this?
- Yeah.

257
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,621
This is a wind turbine.

258
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,290
You made this? No way.

259
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:50,959
This is amazing.

260
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:53,670
It's good as new, right?

261
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:55,797
I'll walk you home.

262
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:57,841
- What's your name?
- Jorge.

263
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,301
Jorge? I'm Spider-Man.

264
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:03,471
<i>I don't feel like my kids
are safe with him out there.</i>

265
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:06,558
<i>Get out of the way and let
the police do their job.</i>

266
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:10,937
<i>Some folks think that there might be
more than one Spider-Man.</i>

267
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:13,398
<i>What do you think?</i>

268
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,316
<i>One guy or many?</i>

269
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:18,403
<i>I'd love to know who's behind that mask.</i>

270
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:19,654
Hey.

271
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,364
- Nice outfit.
- Thanks.

272
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,409
<i>We have a caller on the line named Max.
He says he knows Spider-Man.</i>

273
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,829
<i>Listen, I'm upset. Spider-Man,
to me, is being misunderstood.</i>

274
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,415
<i>He's a very, very good person.
He's protecting us.</i>

275
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:31,833
<i>He saved my life one time.</i>

276
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:34,210
<i>We sort of became best friends.</i>

277
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,464
How much?

278
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:38,923
Hey, you're that spider guy.

279
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:40,300
I'm Spider-Man.

280
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,140
I'm Spider-Man.

281
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,268
<i>This Spider-Man...
He's not the police, he's not a fireman.</i>

282
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:53,313
<i>What gives him the right to get
involved in other people's business?</i>

283
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:26,429
Peter, honey?

284
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:28,640
Can I come in?

285
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,601
No!

286
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,895
Peter, the final starts at 9, honey.

287
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,231
You said you would take
my car into the shop...

288
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:37,941
...because it keeps dying, remember?

289
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:41,110
Give me a second, Aunt May. I'm gonna
get the door. Just give me a second.

290
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:43,154
Peter, please just let me in. All right?

291
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,405
I'm trying to get my...

292
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:47,825
You said your final was at 9, and you're
gonna take my car into the shop.

293
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:50,745
- No! You can't come in. I'm so naked.
- What are you do...?

294
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,414
Peter! For goodness sakes.

295
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:56,626
You said you're gonna take my car
into the shop because it kee...!

296
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,837
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

297
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:01,214
I'm just...

298
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:03,007
I'm very naked right now.

299
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:05,468
What happened to your face?
It's filthy.

300
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:07,804
- It is?
- Yes.

301
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:10,848
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I was cleaning the chimney.

302
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:12,934
We have no chimney.

303
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:14,477
What?

304
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,187
- You're late.
- I know, I'm late.

305
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:18,064
Downstairs, now.

306
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:21,067
- Can you leave? Because I'm naked.
- All right, I'm leaving.

307
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:24,696
- Morning, I love you.
- I love you too. Hurry up.

308
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:08,031
Well, look who's here.

309
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:09,449
Spidey.

310
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:11,284
How was your morning?

311
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,620
Aces, Max, aces.

312
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,872
I've been out saving the world.

313
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:17,457
Protecting everybody.

314
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:20,460
But is someone celebrating
a birthday today?

315
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:24,005
That's why you're here.

316
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,174
You remembered my birthday.

317
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:31,095
All the crime-fighting you've been doing,
and all of a sudden...

318
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:34,849
...you take time out to come visit
little old me. Max. It's amazing to...

319
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,894
But of course you would.

320
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:39,646
Why wouldn't you visit me?

321
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:41,731
We're best friends.

322
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:48,071
What are you doing?
You made me a cake?

323
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:51,491
People don't get a chance to see these small,
kind things that you do for people.

324
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:53,534
I know what they say
about you in the press...

325
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:55,912
...but it doesn't matter to me.
I know the real you.

326
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,789
Because you're amazing.

327
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,042
That's what the press needs.

328
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:04,128
They should call you
The Amazing Spider-Man.

329
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:06,214
You like that, Spidey?

330
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,383
I like it a lot, Max.

331
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:11,302
Good. Because today...

332
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,096
...is going to be...

333
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:14,347
...amazing.

334
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:18,101
Yeah. Circuit 39.

335
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:24,982
I'm not late, Harvey.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

336
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:28,194
I just wanna know if you can
find another waitress...

337
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:32,115
...to replace me because I start
my training rounds at the hospital.

338
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:34,909
And don't mention this to Peter.
I don't want him to know.

339
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,452
Because he'll worry.

340
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:39,080
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, you got it.

341
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,873
Double shift on Thursday.

342
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:42,625
Okay, bye.

343
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:47,130
- Who was that?
- Harvey.

344
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:51,426
- Doing a double shift, huh?
- Sometimes.

345
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:53,928
Got nothing else to do. I like the girls.

346
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:57,557
I miss Ben. Gives me
a little extra in the cookie jar.

347
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,979
Well, I sold another couple of photos
to the <i>Bugle</i>, so that ought to help.

348
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:06,315
Yeah, it would really help if that guy
would pay you a fair wage.

349
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:08,025
Jameson pays me a fair wage.

350
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:10,611
If it was 1961, he pays me a fair wage.

351
00:26:10,862 --> 00:26:14,282
Hey, wait. What are you doing?
What are you doing? No, I do the laundry.

352
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:16,534
- I'm doing my laundry.
- No, I do the laundry.

353
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:20,288
No, this is my job. I've been doing your
laundry since you were 6 years old.

354
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:22,165
I understand that. I'm in college now.

355
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:25,126
I think it's time that I took care
of my own dirty underwear.

356
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:27,879
Last time you did the laundry,
you turned everything blue and red...

357
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:29,130
- ...so no.
- That was a mistake.

358
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,383
Because I was washing the American flag.

359
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:35,678
- My... Can I please just...?
- No one washes a flag.

360
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:36,929
I do, and I won't anymore.

361
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,182
- This is my machine.
- Fine. It's just underwear.

362
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:41,851
This is my laundry, my home, my machine.

363
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,394
Back off, eat your breakfast.

364
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:48,274
All right, laundry sheriff. I'll do it later.

365
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:49,859
- I'll do it.
- No, forget it.

366
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,944
- Give it to me.
- I'll do it some other time.

367
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:54,530
- Hey.
- Excuse me.

368
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:55,865
Jerk.

369
00:26:57,992 --> 00:26:58,993
Not gonna make it.

370
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:04,665
Logjam. Come on, come on, come on.

371
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,794
- Watch it, buddy.
- Hey, let's go.

372
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:13,925
<i>Oscorp Industries...</i>

373
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:18,596
<i>...is proud to announce the world's
first electromagnetic power grid.</i>

374
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:23,184
<i>By converting aging power stations
into a field of hydroelectric towers...</i>

375
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:26,938
<i>...we are generating clean,
green, sustainable energy...</i>

376
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:29,649
<i>...to power Manhattan,
the five boroughs...</i>

377
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:32,193
<i>...and eventually the world
for generations to come.</i>

378
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:35,446
- Dillon. You're late.
- Doggone trains are so slow, sir.

379
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,532
Don't you realize Oscorp
is now responsible...

380
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:39,325
...for the entire city's energy supply?

381
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,536
I submitted a lot of designs
for the power grid...

382
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:43,913
...and they used a lot of them,
and I noticed that...

383
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,666
...and those power grids
were designed by me.

384
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,084
You designed them?

385
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:50,461
Sure you did.

386
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:52,213
And I'm Spider-Man.

387
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,508
You're no Spider-Man!
He's a Leo, you're a Sagittarius!

388
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:58,886
You besmirch him again, I'm gonna
rip your well-groomed head off!

389
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,097
Now, get to work.

390
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:04,559
<i>What floor, please?</i>

391
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:07,103
- Seventy-four.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

392
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:08,646
Oh, hold that!

393
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,107
- Can you hold that, please?
- I got it.

394
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:13,317
Thank you, you're a real gentleman.

395
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:15,361
Most people would have
just let those close.

396
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,238
Most people don't notice other people.

397
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:19,866
- <i>What floor, please?</i>
- Sixty-three...

398
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:21,701
I got it. I got it. What is it?

399
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:22,994
Sixty-three.

400
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:25,121
Sixty-three, please.

401
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:26,414
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- In a hurry.

402
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:28,875
Thank you very much.

403
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:34,922
I'm Max. Max Dillon.

404
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:36,507
I'm Gwen.

405
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,551
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

406
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,012
Is it your birthday?

407
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:46,225
Oh, yeah. Well, I... They...
Friends of mine made this flyer up.

408
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:50,021
I'm having a birthday party at a big club.
A lot of celebrities.

409
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:53,316
Would love to invite you,
it's just that the guest list is closed.

410
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:56,777
Oh, got it. Got it.
Well, thank you anyway.

411
00:28:57,028 --> 00:28:58,654
- <i>...dressed as Spider-Man...</i>
- That's exciting.

412
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:00,197
<i>...hanging out near the blaze.</i>

413
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:03,868
It must be cool, huh? To have
the whole world look at you like that?

414
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,330
You know, Spider-Man
saved my life one time.

415
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,416
Out of all the people
in the whole city, he saved...

416
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:11,667
...me.

417
00:29:12,335 --> 00:29:13,544
He said he needed me.

418
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,797
That must be a good feeling.

419
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:19,342
<i>Sixty-third floor.</i>

420
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,844
It was nice to meet you, Max.

421
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:26,557
Wait. She remembered my name.

422
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:45,242
Welcome home.

423
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:58,673
It's dark in there.

424
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:01,008
Your eyes will adjust.

425
00:30:02,677 --> 00:30:04,178
It's better this way.

426
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:34,542
Dad.

427
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:44,218
This is not how I imagined I would die.

428
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:47,304
Looking at my son...

429
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:49,640
...and seeing a stranger.

430
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:54,562
You have such potential, Harry.

431
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:58,482
Such fierce intelligence...

432
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:00,568
...and you're throwing it all away.

433
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:02,820
No, you threw me away.

434
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:08,242
You kicked me off to boarding
school when I was 11.

435
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,038
On my 16th birthday...

436
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:13,998
...you sent me Scotch.

437
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:16,333
Or one of your assistants did.

438
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,420
I'm pretty sure because the card read:

439
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:24,050
"With compliments, Norman Osborn."

440
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:27,011
I don't expect forgiveness from you...

441
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:28,763
...anymore.

442
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:32,600
I don't believe in miracles.

443
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,561
How could you possibly understand...

444
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:39,607
...that your childhood had to be sacrificed...

445
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:41,609
...for something greater?

446
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:44,278
And not just for me.

447
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:45,946
For you!

448
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:51,160
Has your hand started to twitch yet?

449
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:56,707
When you lay awake and
you feel it coming...

450
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,752
...hiding under your skin...

451
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:03,089
...waiting to show itself.

452
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:05,674
To show you...

453
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:08,719
...who you really are.

454
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:15,518
Retroviral hyperplasia.

455
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:19,814
I never told you...

456
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:23,067
...that it's genetic.

457
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:26,737
Our disease...

458
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:30,074
...the Osborn curse.

459
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:33,452
And it began at your age.

460
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:36,247
Let me see it.

461
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,334
Your hand. Give it to me.

462
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:51,804
The greatest inheritance I can give you...

463
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:53,931
...isn't merely money.

464
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:55,182
It's this.

465
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:59,353
The sum total of all my work.

466
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:03,566
Everything I did to stay alive.

467
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:06,277
Maybe you can succeed...

468
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,529
...where I failed.

469
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:34,346
<i>Norman Osborn, the legendary

<i>...of Oscorp Industries, has died...</i>

00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:38,642
<i>...the Osborn estate has confirmed.</i>

472

Harry.

<i>I started Oscorp because I looked
at the world around me and I thought:</i>

479
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:59,246
<i>"We can do better.
And we should do better."</i>

480
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:04,877
<i>Einstein said, "The world cannot be
changed without changing our thinking."</i>

481
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:07,630
<i>But change isn't just a slogan.</i>

482
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:09,757
<i>It begins with hard work.</i>

483
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:13,427
<i>Change begins with persistence
and commitment.</i>

484
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,181
Mr. Osborn changed the world.

485
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:21,685
And now it's up to each of us to ensure
that his hopes and dreams remain alive.

486
00:34:22,353 --> 00:34:23,604
But not today.

487
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:25,731
Today is for mourning.

488
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,108
- Hello?
- <i>Is this Gwen Stacy?</i>

489
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:29,485
Yes, it is. Who's calling?

490
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,570
<i>I'm calling from the Oxford
Scholars Programme.</i>

491
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,572
<i>We have some exciting news.</i>

492
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:40,913
- Dillon. You stay here.
- What?

493
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:43,874
There's a current flow problem in the lab.
Why don't you take a look?

494
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:46,752
It's my birthday. Everybody else is leaving.
Why do I have to stay?

495
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,296
- Because you're special.
- Smythe.

496
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:50,923
I mean, Mr. Smythe.

497
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,716
Happy birthday.

498
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:58,847
<i>Bioelectrogenesis:</i>

499
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:02,893
<i>The generation of electricity
by living organisms to fend off...</i>

500
00:35:03,394 --> 00:35:05,187
Let's see what's going on with you.
Hey, guys.

501
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,438
<i>The genetically manipulated...</i>

502
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:08,524
At least somebody's partying.

503
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:11,360
All right. Just a little sick.

504
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:14,947
I got your medicine, though.

505
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:19,618
I'm so sick that I can't get to my birthday
after all I put together for this company.

506
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:20,953
Designed the grid...

507
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,706
- <i>Warning:</i>
- I should've stretched.

508
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:26,625
- <i>Malfunction in Sector 5A.</i>
- I know. Just a little indigestion.

509
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,378
I bet you didn't know it was
my birthday, did you, Kari?

510
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,588
Think you can sing "Happy Birthday" for me?

511
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,799
I'll just have to sing it for myself.

512
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,301
- Gilbert?
- <i>What?</i>

513
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:39,054
It's Max. Can we shut down
power on Sector 32, please?

514
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:40,431
<i>Forget it. I'm out the door.</i>

515
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:42,474
What do you mean?
I'm up here. It's dangerous.

516
00:35:42,725 --> 00:35:44,059
- <i>Sorry, Max.</i>
- Hello?

517
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:49,898
Fine. I'll do it myself.
And sing my birthday song too.

518
00:35:50,524 --> 00:35:51,859
This is crazy.

519
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:52,002
<i>System restored.</i>

520
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,629
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

521
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:55,589
<i>Harry...</i>

522
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,674
...Oscorp's been under intense public scrutiny...

523
00:36:57,925 --> 00:37:00,094
...in the wake of Dr. Connors' recent...

524
00:37:00,344 --> 00:37:01,428
...breach of trust.

525
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:03,013
You mean people are pissed off...

526
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:06,183
...because he tried to turn everyone
in New York City into giant lizards.

527
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,686
Given that...

528
00:37:09,937 --> 00:37:13,357
...all the animal hybrid programmes
he was involved in were destroyed...

529
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:15,859
...to restore investor confidence.

530
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:19,696
That is the Osborn way.

531
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:23,534
Whatever's inconvenient around here,
just get rid of it, right?

532
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:27,287
Much of that scrutiny
may fall on you now.

533
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,666
We felt that plausible deniability
was your best option.

534
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,668
Sure, sure. I get it.

535
00:37:33,127 --> 00:37:35,170
Twenty-year-old kid.

536
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:37,089
Two hundred billion dollar company.

537
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:38,924
What was Dad thinking?

538
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:41,677
I mean, you're all lawyers, right?

539
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:47,349
Surely, someone must've questioned
his sanity in the end.

540
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,811
Someone must've thought about having
him declared legally incompetent.

541
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:53,188
It would've made this
conversation a lot easier.

542
00:37:53,439 --> 00:37:55,732
- Harry...
- It's Mr. Osborn.

543
00:37:57,443 --> 00:37:59,111
We're not friends.

544
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:05,826
Hi.

545
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,583
You were his assistant, right?

546
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:17,546
What's your name?

547
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,465
Felicia.

548
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:20,883
Felicia.

549
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:22,718
From now on...

550
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:26,763
...everybody at this table works for Felicia...

551
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:30,559
...because Felicia works for me.

552
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:33,896
Would anybody like to speak up?

553
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:39,526
Well, good. Then you can all keep
your jobs a little longer.

554
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:44,156
Sir, there's a Peter Parker here to see you.

555
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:55,584
Felicia, I wanna see every file on this list.

556
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,837
Every single one.

557
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:07,888
Peter Parker.

558
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:11,266
It's like seeing a ghost.

559
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:13,769
Hey, Harry.

560
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:15,812
Random.

561
00:39:16,522 --> 00:39:18,649
- What, 10 years.
- It's eight.

562
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,235
But you're close.

563
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:23,570
What's up?

564
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:25,906
I saw the news, man.

565
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:29,368
I heard about your dad
and I wanted to come and...

566
00:39:29,618 --> 00:39:33,622
Just wanted to come and see you.
Check to see how you were doing.

567
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:36,375
I'm with some people.

568
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,129
I'm in a...

569
00:39:41,672 --> 00:39:42,923
I'm in a meeting.

570
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:44,758
I'm sorry, I don't wanna intrude.

571
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:46,510
I know it's been a long time.

572
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:49,805
I kind of know exactly what
you're going through right now.

573
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:52,641
And you were so there
for me when my parents...

574
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:55,978
Well, that's why I'm here for you.

575
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:57,813
Thank you.

576
00:39:59,982 --> 00:40:01,900
It's good to see you, man.

577
00:40:04,111 --> 00:40:05,612
It's good to see you.

578
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:08,407
I'm sorry about your dad.

579
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,537
You got your braces off.

580
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:20,919
Now there's nothing to distract
from your unibrow.

581
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:25,799
There he is.

582
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:27,801
There he is.

583
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:30,846
You still blow-dry your hair every morning?

584
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:35,767
You know, one of my manservants
holds the hair dryer...

585
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:37,811
...but I work the comb, okay?

586
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:42,065
So at least I'm not completely helpless.

587
00:40:42,316 --> 00:40:44,318
You're stupid.

588
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:53,201
After graduation, I went to Brazil,
then Singapore.

589
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:54,453
- That's right, yeah.
- Yeah.

590
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:56,496
And then Europe.
You know, I went to Europe.

591
00:40:56,747 --> 00:40:57,873
I saw you.

592
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:59,958
What do you mean, you saw me?

593
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:02,419
I saw you in some magazine
with some French supermodel.

594
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:04,421
You know what I'm talking about?

595
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:06,048
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

596
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:09,343
Dude, that whole model thing
is so exhausting.

597
00:41:09,593 --> 00:41:10,927
I know.

598
00:41:13,055 --> 00:41:14,348
What?

599
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:16,558
You got a lady?

600
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:22,898
That's a question.

601
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:25,442
That's a question.

602
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:26,943
Whoa, buddy.

603
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:29,529
No, I don't.

604
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,698
Yeah.

605
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:34,159
I don't know. It's...

606
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:39,539
I don't know. It's complicated.

607
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,625
Yeah, I don't do complicated.

608
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,588
What's her name? Who is she?

609
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:47,964
Her name's Gwen.

610
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,883
Gwen Stacy.

611
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:53,387
- Gwen Stacy.
- She works for you.

612
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:55,097
Really? She works for me?

613
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:58,642
- She does work-study at Oscorp.
- Is she a model employee?

614
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:02,854
You know, when my father sent me away...

615
00:42:03,105 --> 00:42:05,982
...I tried to forget
everything about this place.

616
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:10,404
I guess that kind of included you.

617
00:42:13,532 --> 00:42:16,034
You ain't gotta explain anything
to me, man.

618
00:42:17,953 --> 00:42:19,329
We both got dumped.

619
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:25,335
You ever figure out why
your parents bailed?

620
00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:31,091
My dad left a briefcase.

621
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,094
That's all I got, briefcase full of junk.

622
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:36,638
Whatever. I don't know.
I try not to think about it.

623
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,682
How's that working out for you?

624
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:40,726
Perfectly.

625
00:42:46,982 --> 00:42:49,109
Dude. Nice arm.

626
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:51,987
It's just the wrist. It's just
all in the wrist, buddy.

627
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:54,406
<i>You could do it too if you
just strengthened up that.</i>

628
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,949
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

629
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:59,703
<i>You gotta admit, though.
Things have gotten crazy around here, man.</i>

630
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:02,038
<i>Giant lizards...</i>

631
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:04,541
...and spider guys.

632
00:43:06,752 --> 00:43:09,463
Just one guy. Just one spider man.

633
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:13,008
Or woman. We don't know for sure.

634
00:43:13,467 --> 00:43:17,345
Whatever, dude. He wears spandex
to rescue kittens from trees.

635
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:19,681
I'm so impressed.

636
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,017
I kind of like to think
he gives people hope.

637
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:23,894
For what?

638
00:43:24,144 --> 00:43:26,855
Maybe eventually everything's
gonna be all right.

639
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,524
Yeah, I just wish I had
time for "eventually."

640
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:34,821
Who was he?

641
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:37,824
Maxwell Dillon. Electrical engineer.

642
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:40,827
No associates or friends to speak of.

643
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,414
He submitted specs for the grid
that we appropriated.

644
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:45,791
The guy was...

645
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:47,751
...invisible.

646
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:52,589
Wall Street's nervous enough
with that child, Harry, taking over.

647
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:54,841
We've gotta find a way to get him out.

648
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:59,721
In the meantime, if the press gets hold
of this accident, our stock will crater.

649
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:03,809
So make sure this Mr. Dillon stays invisible.

650
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:08,438
This could prove useful
for us in the future.

651
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:16,673
Hey.

652
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:45,285
Hey, moron! Get out of the street!

653
00:45:58,548 --> 00:46:00,884
Hey. Hi.

654
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:03,929
Hi.

655
00:46:05,472 --> 00:46:06,473
You look amazing.

656
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:12,145
I'm sorry for the spontaneous outreach.
It was kind of...

657
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:14,856
No. I don't... I... Spontaneous...

658
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:17,233
...is all right. You know.

659
00:46:17,484 --> 00:46:19,945
Well, I just figured it was time.

660
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:22,280
You know?

661
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,449
Time that we try to be friends.

662
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:26,952
Yeah.

663
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:31,206
Friends, yeah. That's...

664
00:46:32,332 --> 00:46:33,333
...great.

665
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:35,835
I just don't want us to be complicated.

666
00:46:36,086 --> 00:46:38,254
I was just saying that to someone.
I hate complicated.

667
00:46:38,672 --> 00:46:40,090
Keep it simple.

668
00:46:41,383 --> 00:46:44,052
Okay, great, great. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right.

669
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:45,553
Well, I mean...

670
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:52,686
if we're gonna be friends, I think
we gotta establish some ground rules.

671
00:46:52,936 --> 00:46:55,188
- Some ground rules?
- Yeah, some ground rules.

672
00:46:55,689 --> 00:46:56,815
Like that.

673
00:46:57,065 --> 00:46:58,274
Like what?

674
00:46:59,693 --> 00:47:01,778
- That laugh. That laugh.
- What?

675
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,571
That's off the table.

676
00:47:03,822 --> 00:47:05,532
- My laugh is off the table?
- Off the table.

677
00:47:05,782 --> 00:47:08,076
You gotta figure out
a more annoying laugh.

678
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:12,247
That's still adorable.

679
00:47:12,998 --> 00:47:15,000
- That was not adorable.
- It's adorable.

680
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:16,459
No, it's not adorable.

681
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:19,379
- Okay. I have a ground rule.
- Oh, good.

682
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:20,880
What is it?

683
00:47:21,381 --> 00:47:23,758
Don't tell me that I look amazing...

684
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:28,054
...with your big brown doe eyes. Okay?

685
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:31,099
I'm really serious about that one.

686
00:47:32,434 --> 00:47:34,310
- Oh, no.
- What?

687
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:36,354
I just figured out the next ground rule.

688
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:37,772
What?

689
00:47:38,023 --> 00:47:39,524
No more of this.

690
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:41,735
No more of this little nose rub that you do.

691
00:47:41,985 --> 00:47:43,570
- This?
- Don't think I haven't... Hey.

692
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:46,531
What am I supposed to do?
It's allergy season.

693
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,199
This is killing me.

694
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:50,952
You're just spitting in the face
of my ground rules. I'm out.

695
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:52,454
Come on.

696
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:56,458
First we get ice cream, and then I'm out.

697
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:36,539
Yeah. So I did that.

698
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:41,669
And I got completely addicted to this
place that has Korean meatballs.

699
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,589
- Yeah. No, I know.
- Have you been there? It's mind-blowing.

700
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:47,258
That place on 6th. I know.
You love it there.

701
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,679
How do you know that?

702
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:56,559
How do you know I love it there?

703
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:58,520
Because...

704
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,398
Because you told me.

705
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:07,695
It just opened last month.

706
00:49:11,533 --> 00:49:13,284
Have you been following me?

707
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,125
I knew it.

708
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,001
How often?

709
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:27,090
Just once a day.

710
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,675
Sometimes.

711
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:32,762
Sometimes more.

712
00:49:37,267 --> 00:49:38,893
Oh, boy.

713
00:49:39,269 --> 00:49:40,395
Why?

714
00:49:44,941 --> 00:49:46,484
Make sure I'm safe?

715
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,195
- And...
- And what?

716
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:52,866
And because it's the closest
I can get to still being with you.

717
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,213
I'm moving to England.

718
00:50:15,722 --> 00:50:16,848
What?

719
00:50:17,557 --> 00:50:18,808
Yeah.

720
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:22,854
I have a...
I'm up for a scholarship to Oxford.

721
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:27,108
In molecular medicine.
And it's between me and this other kid.

722
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,235
There's this oral exam
that we have to do...

723
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:32,238
...and he's, like, a freshman
in college, but he's 14.

724
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:34,365
And... And it's... It could be him.

725
00:50:34,616 --> 00:50:36,409
But it might be me. I hope it's me.

726
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:39,954
And I'm thinking that I'll be
moving to England.

727
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,166
Yeah.

728
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:45,168
And I'm really excited.

729
00:50:46,628 --> 00:50:47,921
That's...

730
00:50:51,216 --> 00:50:52,508
England.

731
00:50:55,428 --> 00:50:56,679
What?

732
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:55,113
Station, I need a 10-85.

733
00:51:55,363 --> 00:51:58,366
Send out additional units
to the south-end corner of Duffy Square.

734
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:00,493
Folks, could you step to the side?

735
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:02,870
Everybody get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

736
00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:06,749
Sir, get your hands away
from the cables right now!

737
00:52:07,292 --> 00:52:09,919
Sir, get your hands away from the cables!

738
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:12,130
Let me see your hands, please!

739
00:52:13,965 --> 00:52:15,174
You stay right where you are!

740
00:52:15,425 --> 00:52:16,634
Do not move!

741
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:19,012
Freeze! Get down! On the ground!

742
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:38,531
Get down on the ground, now!

743
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:41,409
- Stop!
- Get your ass down on the ground! Now!

744
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,328
- It's not my fault!
- Sir!

745
00:52:43,578 --> 00:52:44,954
- Stop!
- I'm gonna need for you...

746
00:52:45,204 --> 00:52:46,914
- Please!
- ...to get down on the ground, now!

747
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:50,376
For your own safety and the safety
of the other patrons in this area.

748
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:54,255
Oh, my gosh.

749
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:58,301
They see me. You see me.

750
00:53:00,345 --> 00:53:01,804
You see me.

751
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:03,890
They see me.

752
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:17,945
- No! No! Stop!
- On the ground now!

753
00:53:18,196 --> 00:53:20,823
- Don't do that. Please!
- It's over, freak!

754
00:53:21,074 --> 00:53:23,368
Wait! It's not my fault.

755
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:24,619
It's not my fault!

756
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:28,998
I said stop!

757
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:37,590
I'm glad you're not one of those
cops that rides a horse.

758
00:53:45,014 --> 00:53:47,350
All team members, hold your
fire and wait for my call.

759
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:54,315
<i>All units, hold your fire!
I repeat, hold your fire! Stand down!</i>

760
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:58,361
Stop. Stop it.

761
00:53:58,611 --> 00:53:59,737
Yo, Sparkles!

762
00:54:01,489 --> 00:54:02,657
Hey, how you doing?

763
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:06,160
- It's you?
- Yeah, I know it's me.

764
00:54:06,411 --> 00:54:07,286
Who are you?

765
00:54:09,205 --> 00:54:10,331
You don't remember me?

766
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:12,708
No. Should I?

767
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:16,754
I walked into the street. The car almost hit me.
You swooped me up.

768
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:18,423
You saved me.

769
00:54:18,673 --> 00:54:20,341
You said you needed me.

770
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:23,261
- You're the guy with the blueprints.
- Yes.

771
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:24,720
Blueprints.

772
00:54:25,138 --> 00:54:29,851
Yes, I remember you. Of course I remember you.
You're my eyes and ears.

773
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:32,895
- What's your name again?
- How could you forget me?

774
00:54:33,146 --> 00:54:35,565
- I do, I know it, I know it, don't tell me.
- It's Max.

775
00:54:35,815 --> 00:54:37,608
- Is it "Max"?
- Yes.

776
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:39,777
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you with the...

777
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:41,696
You look different.

778
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:43,406
How are you?

779
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:45,491
I don't know what's going on with me.

780
00:54:45,825 --> 00:54:47,785
I can see that. I can... I believe you.

781
00:54:48,828 --> 00:54:53,332
It's strange, the power I feel.
I got so much...

782
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:55,501
I got so much anger.

783
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:58,504
I can see that. I can see you don't
wanna be here and you're scared.

784
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:00,506
I see you don't know
what's happening to you.

785
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:02,508
I can see you don't want to hurt anybody.

786
00:55:03,134 --> 00:55:05,344
- It's gonna be all right.
- Got a clear shot. Standing by.

787
00:55:05,595 --> 00:55:07,513
- I don't want them shooting me anymore.
- They won't.

788
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:10,266
You guys. This is my buddy, Max.

789
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:13,853
I told you about Max.
No one shoots at Max!

790
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:16,355
You and me, okay?
It's just you and me talking.

791
00:55:16,606 --> 00:55:19,984
Stay right there. Just be careful.
The grate, because of the electricity.

792
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:21,235
I just...

793
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:24,864
I just wanted everyone to see me.

794
00:55:25,114 --> 00:55:27,033
<i>He makes a move, you take that shot.</i>

795
00:55:27,283 --> 00:55:29,202
How about you come with me?
We'll go talk.

796
00:55:29,452 --> 00:55:31,245
Away from all these people, okay?

797
00:55:31,496 --> 00:55:32,455
Yeah, yes.

798
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:35,249
No! No! Stop!

799
00:55:39,045 --> 00:55:40,129
Max!

800
00:55:58,731 --> 00:56:01,359
<i>Spidey, Spidey, Spidey!</i>

801
00:56:03,236 --> 00:56:05,071
You stupid freak!

802
00:56:11,327 --> 00:56:12,954
Electro dummy!

803
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:22,171
Get out of here, you freak!

804
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:23,422
Shut up!

805
00:56:26,175 --> 00:56:27,718
You're so selfish.

806
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:30,096
Stay with me, Max.

807
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:31,639
You set me up.

808
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,099
No, I didn't set you up.

809
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:34,850
You lied to me!

810
00:56:35,101 --> 00:56:36,852
No, I'm trying to help you.
Let me help you.

811
00:57:24,984 --> 00:57:25,985
Are you all right?

812
00:57:31,866 --> 00:57:33,409
It's my birthday.

813
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:35,620
Now it's time for me to light my candles.

814
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:55,741
Do we have visual on Spider-Man?

815
00:58:56,826 --> 00:58:59,286
Does anyone have visual on Spider-Man?

816
00:59:09,672 --> 00:59:12,925
Okay. All right, that's enough. All right.

817
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:14,552
- Mike.
- Yeah.

818
00:59:14,802 --> 00:59:16,053
- Big John.
- Nice job.

819
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:17,722
Nice work, fellas.

820
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:20,766
It's a pleasure doing business with you.

821
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,276
Spider-Man.

822
00:59:36,699 --> 00:59:37,950
England?

823
00:59:39,702 --> 00:59:40,703
Really?

824
00:59:50,755 --> 00:59:51,964
Good talk.

825
01:00:10,274 --> 01:00:11,817
<i>Our coverage of this breaking story...</i>

826
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:14,320
<i>...begins with New York 1's
Jessica Abo at the scene.</i>

827
01:00:14,737 --> 01:00:16,989
<i>That's right. We're standing
here with two eyewitnesses...</i>

828
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:19,074
<i>...who are going to tell us
what they just saw.</i>

829
01:00:19,325 --> 01:00:21,076
<i>Tell us, how do you think Spider-Man did it?</i>

830
01:00:21,327 --> 01:00:22,870
<i>How do you think he beat this creature?</i>

831
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,914
<i>Yeah, it's gotta be rubberized, Spidey's suit.</i>

832
01:00:25,164 --> 01:00:26,707
<i>That's why he didn't get electrocuted.</i>

833
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:29,251
<i>Probably some kind of neoprene.
That's what I'd use.</i>

834
01:00:29,502 --> 01:00:31,003
<i>Thank you very much to the two of you.</i>

835
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:33,714
<i>As you can tell, so many
questions remain unanswered.</i>

836
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,425
<i>We will bring you the latest
information as it becomes available.</i>

837
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:39,011
<i>For now, Jessica Abo, New York 1.
Let's send it back to you.</i>

838
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:29,705
<i>Online polls show a sudden uptick...</i>

839
01:02:29,955 --> 01:02:32,333
<i>...in public sentiment
in favor of the web-crawler.</i>

840
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:36,420
<i>Tonight, it would seem New York City
owes him a debt of gratitude.</i>

841
01:03:08,035 --> 01:03:10,037
<i>Next-generation military body armor.</i>

842
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:14,291
<i>Features include enhanced mobility,
battlefield injury repair...</i>

843
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:16,835
<i>...direct nervous system interface.</i>

844
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:28,055
<i>So the common household spider...</i>

845
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:29,640
<i>...unlike human cells...</i>

846
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:32,476
<i>...theirs contain the power to self-heal...</i>

847
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:36,271
<i>...from severe infection,
tissue damage, et cetera.</i>

848
01:03:36,522 --> 01:03:41,110
<i>We've used a radioactive isotope
with compatible human DNA.</i>

849
01:03:42,236 --> 01:03:46,240
<i>Welcome to Dr. Jallings,
Science Investigator.</i>

850
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:49,326
<i>Today we're going to be
talking about electricity.</i>

851
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:52,621
<i>Batteries, insulators,
electromagnetic currents.</i>

852
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:55,374
<i>Batteries can withstand
a lot of incoming charges.</i>

853
01:03:55,624 --> 01:03:58,794
<i>The more powerful the battery,
the bigger the charge it can withstand.</i>

854
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:02,798
<i>But if the incoming charge
exceeds the outgoing charge...</i>

855
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:05,384
<i>...the battery might explode!</i>

856
01:04:05,968 --> 01:04:07,219
<i>Explode!</i>

857
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:12,891
<i>When doing experiments like this,
always wear protective gear.</i>

858
01:04:13,142 --> 01:04:14,268
<i>You're not invincible.</i>

859
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:16,437
We're gonna need a bigger battery.

860
01:04:57,936 --> 01:04:59,313
- Hello.
- <i>Pete.</i>

861
01:04:59,897 --> 01:05:01,190
<i>It's me.</i>

862
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:03,150
Hey, Harry. What...?

863
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:05,944
What time is it?

864
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:09,990
<i>Late, early, I don't know.
I've been up all night.</i>

865
01:05:10,491 --> 01:05:11,700
<i>I need to see you.</i>

866
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:13,160
You all right?

867
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:14,787
<i>Not really, Pete.</i>

868
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:16,497
<i>I'm dying.</i>

869
01:05:16,747 --> 01:05:19,500
<i>But I think you can help save my life.</i>

870
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:25,089
<i>You're looking at the world's first
human-spider hybrids.</i>

871
01:05:25,339 --> 01:05:28,217
<i>The hope is to extract
the venom from their glands...</i>

872
01:05:28,467 --> 01:05:30,886
<i>...and turn that into a cure.</i>

873
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:33,722
<i>An agent that heals diseased cells.</i>

874
01:05:33,972 --> 01:05:39,103
<i>And if I can be cured, imagine what
this could do for other diseases...</i>

875
01:05:39,353 --> 01:05:41,438
<i>...like Alzheimer's, even cancer.</i>

876
01:05:45,234 --> 01:05:48,028
They never made it to human trials.

877
01:05:48,362 --> 01:05:51,990
It's 14 years of research,
and nothing to show for it.

878
01:05:55,244 --> 01:05:56,453
Except maybe this.

879
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:06,088
Spider-Man.

880
01:06:07,089 --> 01:06:08,340
What about him?

881
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:12,010
He was bitten by one of those
things, and it worked.

882
01:06:12,636 --> 01:06:16,265
I don't know how and I don't know why...

883
01:06:16,849 --> 01:06:20,144
...but he can do everything else a spider can...

884
01:06:20,394 --> 01:06:22,521
...including self-heal.

885
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,481
I need to find him.

886
01:06:25,274 --> 01:06:26,859
I need his blood.

887
01:06:42,374 --> 01:06:43,750
You need...

888
01:06:44,793 --> 01:06:47,004
...Spider-Man's blood?

889
01:06:50,591 --> 01:06:52,634
It'll save my life.

890
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,970
It may not, Har.

891
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,556
It may not be that simple.

892
01:06:57,806 --> 01:06:59,558
You saw what happened
to Curt Connors, right?

893
01:06:59,808 --> 01:07:00,809
Connors was weak.

894
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:03,312
This is me, Peter.

895
01:07:03,562 --> 01:07:05,647
I don't think you can just set up a van...

896
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:07,816
...and have him donate.

897
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:13,280
I mean, I'm sure he's sensitive
about people shoving needles and...

898
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:14,656
He's sensitive, okay.

899
01:07:15,157 --> 01:07:19,912
Well, then, maybe you could just
sensitively tell me where he is...

900
01:07:20,162 --> 01:07:22,456
...and I will go ask him myself.

901
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:23,957
What?

902
01:07:27,002 --> 01:07:28,962
- You took his picture.
- So?

903
01:07:29,588 --> 01:07:31,215
- You know him.
- Harry.

904
01:07:31,465 --> 01:07:34,760
I took a picture from a long way away.
I used a long lens.

905
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:36,220
I don't know him.

906
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:41,016
I put together what you said at the river.

907
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:45,312
- What I...
- About how he gives people hope.

908
01:07:47,439 --> 01:07:48,732
Come on.

909
01:08:02,496 --> 01:08:03,538
What in the...?

910
01:08:08,502 --> 01:08:10,045
Just say yes.

911
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,887
Don't turn your back on me!

912
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:22,683
I don't wanna end up
like my father, Peter.

913
01:08:24,393 --> 01:08:25,811
Please.

914
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,022
Peter, please.

915
01:08:29,273 --> 01:08:30,649
I can't.

916
01:08:34,653 --> 01:08:35,696
Please.

917
01:08:40,534 --> 01:08:42,202
I'm gonna try...

918
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:44,705
...and find Spider-Man.

919
01:08:54,923 --> 01:08:57,759
- Hey, what's security doing over here?
- That's so weird.

920
01:08:58,010 --> 01:08:58,885
She's right over there.

921
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:07,769
Hey! Miss Stacy!

922
01:09:24,036 --> 01:09:25,037
Hi.

923
01:09:25,287 --> 01:09:26,538
Hi.

924
01:09:26,872 --> 01:09:28,165
What are you doing here?

925
01:09:28,707 --> 01:09:30,250
What are you doing here?

926
01:09:32,127 --> 01:09:33,295
Come here.

927
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:42,054
She's not here. Check another floor.

928
01:09:42,304 --> 01:09:43,680
- Got it.
- Yes, sir!

929
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:45,015
You're in trouble.

930
01:09:45,265 --> 01:09:46,433
- Yeah.
- Who's that guy?

931
01:09:46,683 --> 01:09:49,436
There was an accident in the genomics lab,
and they're covering it up.

932
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:52,939
And I found out.
That guy from Times Square last night?

933
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:56,360
I met him. He was an electrical
engineer in the building.

934
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:59,571
And he loved Spider-Man, by the way.
He was, like, a fanatic.

935
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:03,450
I didn't get love vibes. I got more of a
"want to kill me with his electricity" vibe.

936
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,744
That's actually kind of
what it's like to love you.

937
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:10,040
I was searching for him in the computer
and all the files, he's erased.

938
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:11,541
- My God.
- He's completely erased.

939
01:10:11,792 --> 01:10:13,001
That's Oscorp.

940
01:10:13,627 --> 01:10:15,128
And what about you? Why are you here?

941
01:10:15,379 --> 01:10:16,421
Harry.

942
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:18,131
- Osborn?
- He's dying.

943
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:19,925
- What do you mean?
- He's dying.

944
01:10:20,175 --> 01:10:22,594
And he thinks the only thing
that's gonna save his life...

945
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:25,514
...is my blood, is Spider-Man's blood.

946
01:10:25,764 --> 01:10:28,225
And as far as I know,
if I give it to him, it could kill him.

947
01:10:28,475 --> 01:10:30,268
Or something worse.

948
01:10:30,936 --> 01:10:32,062
I know.

949
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:34,773
This is the maintenance closet, Gwen.

950
01:10:35,315 --> 01:10:38,193
This is the most clichéd hiding
place you could've chosen.

951
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:40,404
- This is the stupidest hiding place.
- I'm sorry...

952
01:10:40,654 --> 01:10:44,616
...I didn't take us
to the Bahamas of hiding places.

953
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:48,620
I gotta talk to you about England,
I guess, because I don't...

954
01:10:58,338 --> 01:11:01,425
- You just kissed me.
- I know, I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

955
01:11:02,384 --> 01:11:03,468
How'd you like it?

956
01:11:03,969 --> 01:11:05,303
It felt a little bit rushed.

957
01:11:05,554 --> 01:11:07,681
I know. I know, I know.

958
01:11:08,265 --> 01:11:11,685
This is the plan. You get to the elevator.
I'm gonna distract him, okay?

959
01:11:11,935 --> 01:11:12,853
Okay.

960
01:11:27,701 --> 01:11:29,494
- God! Damn it!
- I'm so...

961
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:32,956
I just spilled a hot latte all over your...
I didn't mean to do that. Oh, no!

962
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:35,041
And you too? I'm sorry.

963
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:36,793
- Miss! Stay right there!
- Sir.

964
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:39,296
- Just stay right...
- Wait, wait, wait.

965
01:11:39,546 --> 01:11:40,547
Hey! Stop!

966
01:11:43,008 --> 01:11:44,009
All right. On your way.

967
01:11:44,259 --> 01:11:46,511
I'm sorry. I'm all thumbs today.

968
01:11:51,308 --> 01:11:53,477
- Gwen Stacy.
- Oh, my God.

969
01:11:54,436 --> 01:11:55,729
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

970
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:57,314
No, it's okay.

971
01:11:58,565 --> 01:12:00,484
I'm... I'm Harry.

972
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:02,194
Yeah.

973
01:12:02,903 --> 01:12:06,573
- I'm an old friend of Peter's.
- Yeah, I know who you are. Sorry.

974
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:08,450
I was kind of rushing.

975
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:11,119
No, I'm sorry he never introduced us.

976
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:13,455
I thought you two had broken up.

977
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:18,668
Yeah. Yes, we had.

978
01:12:18,919 --> 01:12:20,462
And it's...

979
01:12:20,712 --> 01:12:22,589
- It's complicated.
- Complicated. Yeah.

980
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:26,051
I mean, it's Peter.
Everything's always complicated with Peter.

981
01:12:26,301 --> 01:12:27,302
Yeah.

982
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:29,095
Yeah.

983
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:31,264
Yeah, you're right.

984
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:33,600
But that's why he needs you.

985
01:12:35,227 --> 01:12:36,436
Right?

986
01:12:38,605 --> 01:12:41,107
To help him make his choices clear.

987
01:12:44,945 --> 01:12:45,946
Nice to meet you, Harry.

988
01:12:46,196 --> 01:12:49,199
Yeah, it's such a pleasure, Gwen.

989
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:48,133
You've been in a terrible accident.

990
01:13:49,426 --> 01:13:51,386
I'm Dr. Kafka.

991
01:13:52,053 --> 01:13:53,972
I'm here to help you.

992
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:55,932
Course you are, doc.

993
01:13:56,975 --> 01:14:01,062
That's why you're preparing
military-grade biostim electrodes.

994
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:03,648
High-intensity capacitors.

995
01:14:04,608 --> 01:14:06,109
The kind they make at Oscorp.

996
01:14:06,693 --> 01:14:09,279
All of this because you're
trying to help me.

997
01:14:09,529 --> 01:14:10,697
You are correct.

998
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:13,033
I'm here to study you.

999
01:14:13,283 --> 01:14:17,954
To understand what you are, why you are.

1000
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:20,081
<i>Und</i> I will get results.

1001
01:14:25,629 --> 01:14:27,297
I always do.

1002
01:14:29,758 --> 01:14:31,468
You do realize...

1003
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:33,887
...you locked me in a prison...

1004
01:14:34,429 --> 01:14:35,722
...that runs...

1005
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:37,807
...on electricity?

1006
01:14:40,393 --> 01:14:42,937
I can feel it in the walls.

1007
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:45,106
I can feel it in my veins.

1008
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:48,652
No matter what you do, doc,
you can't contain it.

1009
01:14:50,153 --> 01:14:51,237
It's a force of nature.

1010
01:14:52,906 --> 01:14:53,907
Like me.

1011
01:15:01,373 --> 01:15:02,874
You wanna know how powerful I am?

1012
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:05,377
Well, so do I.

1013
01:15:10,799 --> 01:15:13,176
I'm dying to know...

1014
01:15:13,885 --> 01:15:15,011
...doc.

1015
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:18,765
But you better make damn sure
you kill me this time.

1016
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:20,517
Because if you don't...

1017
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:23,186
...I'm gonna kill the light.

1018
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:27,899
<i>So everyone in this city is gonna know
how it feels to live in my world.</i>

1019
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,610
<i>A world without power.</i>

1020
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,238
A world without mercy.

1021
01:15:33,655 --> 01:15:35,031
A world...

1022
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:36,908
...without Spider-Man.

1023
01:15:37,409 --> 01:15:41,705
And everyone will be able
to see me for who I truly am.

1024
01:15:42,372 --> 01:15:44,374
And who are you?

1025
01:15:44,916 --> 01:15:46,376
Don't you know?

1026
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:48,253
I'm Electro.

1027
01:15:53,508 --> 01:15:56,803
<i>Warning: Electrical restraint
capacity reached.</i>

1028
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:59,806
<i>Initiate lockdown procedure immediately.</i>

1029
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:01,683
Very impressive...

1030
01:16:02,392 --> 01:16:04,310
...Electro.

1031
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:06,938
<i>Lockdown initiated.</i>

1032
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:21,161
Aunt May?

1033
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:27,917
What are you doing?

1034
01:16:28,376 --> 01:16:29,794
When did you do this?

1035
01:16:39,304 --> 01:16:41,931
There's something you're not
telling me, Aunt May.

1036
01:16:42,182 --> 01:16:45,185
Every time I mention my parents,
your eyes go down.

1037
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:48,730
I know you're not telling me something.
You lie to me. I know you love me.

1038
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:50,815
- I don't lie.
- I know you love me, but you do.

1039
01:16:51,065 --> 01:16:52,442
Aunt May, Aunt May.

1040
01:16:53,443 --> 01:16:55,236
You have to tell me, May.

1041
01:16:56,237 --> 01:16:57,447
That's my father.

1042
01:16:57,697 --> 01:16:59,115
Yes, he was your father.

1043
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:01,993
But that didn't seem to stop
him from leaving you...

1044
01:17:02,702 --> 01:17:03,870
...here.

1045
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:06,998
I need the truth.

1046
01:17:09,459 --> 01:17:11,795
The truth is, your parents left
you here, on our doorstep.

1047
01:17:12,045 --> 01:17:13,797
You were this little boy
whose whole world...

1048
01:17:14,047 --> 01:17:16,758
...was turned upside down
with no explanation.

1049
01:17:17,008 --> 01:17:21,763
We did the best we could,
your Uncle Ben and I.

1050
01:17:22,305 --> 01:17:25,600
I mean, who else was gonna care for you,
and protect you and worry about you?

1051
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:27,101
Your father?

1052
01:17:27,435 --> 01:17:28,520
No.

1053
01:17:28,770 --> 01:17:32,899
I was the one who wiped your nose,
and made you brush your teeth...

1054
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:35,819
...and do your homework,
or washed your dirty underwear. Me!

1055
01:17:36,194 --> 01:17:40,782
Your stupid, non-scientific aunt,
who doesn't know how to make ends meet...

1056
01:17:41,032 --> 01:17:42,659
...who has to take nursing classes...

1057
01:17:42,909 --> 01:17:45,787
...with 22-year-old kids so I can
pay for you to go to college.

1058
01:17:46,037 --> 01:17:48,122
And I don't know how
to do this without Ben.

1059
01:17:48,373 --> 01:17:49,499
I don't know how. And...

1060
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:53,461
And you're dreaming about
your perfect father...

1061
01:17:53,711 --> 01:17:56,381
...who was never here. No.

1062
01:17:57,549 --> 01:17:59,092
No, I won't tell you.

1063
01:17:59,384 --> 01:18:00,468
You're my boy.

1064
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:03,054
As far as I'm concerned, you're my boy.

1065
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:04,389
And I won't hurt you.

1066
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:15,733
I'm your boy.

1067
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:17,735
You're my everything.

1068
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:22,448
You're enough.
You're more than enough.

1069
01:18:22,699 --> 01:18:25,118
That's not what this is about.
Don't get that twisted.

1070
01:18:26,244 --> 01:18:28,997
- I love you so much.
- I know.

1071
01:18:33,877 --> 01:18:35,211
It's okay.

1072
01:18:36,588 --> 01:18:37,672
It's okay.

1073
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:41,801
May.

1074
01:18:44,929 --> 01:18:47,098
I need to know.

1075
01:18:51,728 --> 01:18:52,937
All right.

1076
01:18:56,524 --> 01:18:58,401
I'll tell you everything I know.

1077
01:19:01,404 --> 01:19:02,864
But it will hurt you.

1078
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:05,074
Okay.

1079
01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:10,204
A few days after the funeral...

1080
01:19:10,455 --> 01:19:14,208
...two government men came to see us.

1081
01:19:16,294 --> 01:19:19,172
<i>They said the genetics research...</i>

1082
01:19:19,422 --> 01:19:22,884
<i>...that your father was doing
with Norman Osborn was very valuable...</i>

1083
01:19:23,134 --> 01:19:25,762
<i>...and that people would pay a lot for it.</i>

1084
01:19:26,012 --> 01:19:28,014
<i>And that's why he ran off with it.</i>

1085
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:29,974
<i>They said he was a traitor.</i>

1086
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:31,976
I couldn't believe it, Peter.

1087
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:35,146
They told us he betrayed
his best friend, all of us...

1088
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:36,856
...for the money.

1089
01:19:38,149 --> 01:19:39,233
I don't...

1090
01:19:41,778 --> 01:19:44,072
Oh, I don't get it. No, I don't...
This doesn't make sense.

1091
01:19:44,322 --> 01:19:47,951
Yes, I know. I know. I didn't believe it either.
I didn't believe it.

1092
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:49,452
It doesn't make any sense.

1093
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:50,912
Peter, I don't know.

1094
01:19:51,329 --> 01:19:54,374
For so long, I would play it over
and over and over in my head.

1095
01:19:54,624 --> 01:19:56,876
What had I missed?
What had I missed?

1096
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:59,629
He was just this normal, unassuming guy.

1097
01:19:59,879 --> 01:20:02,966
He wore the same ratty
lab coat for 20 years.

1098
01:20:03,216 --> 01:20:05,885
He took the D train to work
at 7 every morning.

1099
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:08,304
Came home at 6 every night.

1100
01:20:09,389 --> 01:20:10,890
I don't know.

1101
01:20:11,432 --> 01:20:14,686
Maybe everyone has a part
of themselves they hide.

1102
01:20:15,979 --> 01:20:18,231
Even from the people they love.

1103
01:20:24,529 --> 01:20:25,613
Peter.

1104
01:20:28,908 --> 01:20:30,159
Peter.

1105
01:20:34,205 --> 01:20:35,707
<i>Mr. Osborn.</i>

1106
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:41,879
Look up.

1107
01:20:43,089 --> 01:20:44,632
Think you're looking for me.

1108
01:20:47,385 --> 01:20:49,554
I cannot believe my eyes.

1109
01:20:51,305 --> 01:20:52,598
Spider-Man.

1110
01:20:59,856 --> 01:21:01,899
Just the man I wanted to see.

1111
01:21:04,694 --> 01:21:06,029
You...

1112
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:08,948
...talked to Peter?

1113
01:21:09,866 --> 01:21:10,908
Yeah.

1114
01:21:16,289 --> 01:21:20,209
I wanna help you, Mr. Osborn.
I really, really do.

1115
01:21:21,294 --> 01:21:24,922
I can't give you my blood.
Not right now.

1116
01:21:25,173 --> 01:21:26,299
Excuse me?

1117
01:21:27,258 --> 01:21:29,010
It's too dangerous.

1118
01:21:29,761 --> 01:21:32,263
If our blood is incompatible, you could die.

1119
01:21:33,723 --> 01:21:35,516
I'm already dying.

1120
01:21:36,851 --> 01:21:39,270
Your blood can't make me die more.

1121
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,272
But it could do something worse.

1122
01:21:44,025 --> 01:21:45,193
Okay.

1123
01:21:46,903 --> 01:21:48,571
All right, how much?

1124
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:51,115
- How much what?
- How much do you want? Name it.

1125
01:21:51,365 --> 01:21:55,328
You want a boat? You want a plane?
You want money? How much do you want?

1126
01:21:55,578 --> 01:21:58,831
- I don't want your money.
- Come on. Everybody wants my money!

1127
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:00,666
I don't.

1128
01:22:03,211 --> 01:22:04,378
I thought you...

1129
01:22:05,213 --> 01:22:07,548
I thought you were supposed
to save people.

1130
01:22:08,591 --> 01:22:12,261
I thought that's what you do,
is you save people's lives.

1131
01:22:12,512 --> 01:22:14,806
You're... You're just gonna let me die.

1132
01:22:15,056 --> 01:22:18,267
- I'm trying to protect you right now.
- No. No, you are not.

1133
01:22:18,518 --> 01:22:20,937
You're trying to protect yourself.

1134
01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:25,733
Look, we just need a bit more time...

1135
01:22:25,983 --> 01:22:27,652
- ...to figure out something else.
- I do not have time!

1136
01:22:35,493 --> 01:22:36,577
I'm sorry.

1137
01:22:45,628 --> 01:22:47,922
You're a fraud, Spider-Man!

1138
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:04,438
- Hey! Hi.
- Hi.

1139
01:23:04,689 --> 01:23:07,608
- Hi, I gotta talk to you for a second.
- I'm running late right now.

1140
01:23:07,859 --> 01:23:10,444
- It's just gonna take a second.
- I can't. I'm sorry, Peter.

1141
01:23:10,695 --> 01:23:13,990
Just give me one minute. I just
wanna say one thing and I'm gone.

1142
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:16,200
Everything's a mess.
Everything's insane.

1143
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:19,036
My dad, my mom.
Everything I thought about them? Lies.

1144
01:23:19,287 --> 01:23:21,831
Lies. Lies, lies, lies.
Nothing makes any sense anymore.

1145
01:23:22,081 --> 01:23:23,916
I gotta figure out what I'm
gonna do with Harry.

1146
01:23:24,167 --> 01:23:25,626
Of course I wanna save him.
You know?

1147
01:23:25,877 --> 01:23:27,503
I wanna save him because
he's my best pal.

1148
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:30,590
And what if my blood works?
But what if it doesn't?

1149
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:32,341
I don't know. I got no idea.

1150
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:36,846
- Oh, God.
- I got nothing. I got nothing.

1151
01:23:37,096 --> 01:23:39,849
The only thing I keep
coming back to, Gwen, is...

1152
01:23:41,434 --> 01:23:42,643
Ms. Stacy?

1153
01:23:43,269 --> 01:23:44,437
Shall I take you upstairs?

1154
01:23:44,687 --> 01:23:47,064
Yes. I'm so sorry.

1155
01:23:47,315 --> 01:23:51,485
I'm so sorry. I'm already late.
Can I have just one more minute?

1156
01:23:51,736 --> 01:23:53,529
- Okay.
- Thank you. I'm sorry.

1157
01:23:54,989 --> 01:23:56,949
- I'm... Okay. I have to be...
- Where are we?

1158
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,576
I'm at my...

1159
01:23:59,327 --> 01:24:01,996
...last interview for Oxford right now.

1160
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:05,875
- Oxford. I didn't know.
- Yeah.

1161
01:24:07,335 --> 01:24:08,419
Okay, well...

1162
01:24:08,669 --> 01:24:10,546
I'm sorry to bother you...

1163
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:12,381
...my fair lady... Madam.

1164
01:24:12,632 --> 01:24:14,383
But who am I?

1165
01:24:14,634 --> 01:24:16,177
I mean, who am I? I'm John Hopkins.

1166
01:24:16,427 --> 01:24:18,471
I'm one of the young
professors at Harvard...

1167
01:24:18,721 --> 01:24:21,682
...and I've been trying
to get her to be in my...

1168
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:24,644
Be a part of my team for a while now.

1169
01:24:24,894 --> 01:24:27,813
And she's just the best person
I know and a scientific genius.

1170
01:24:28,064 --> 01:24:29,065
And...

1171
01:24:29,315 --> 01:24:30,733
Anyway, God save the queen.

1172
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:32,777
- I'm sorry everything's happening...
- Can you wait?

1173
01:24:33,027 --> 01:24:34,528
Peter. Peter.

1174
01:24:34,779 --> 01:24:36,364
What do you want to say to me?

1175
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:38,658
What's the "one thing"?

1176
01:24:42,703 --> 01:24:44,580
I have to go to England, Peter.

1177
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:47,959
It's important to me.

1178
01:24:52,338 --> 01:24:55,967
I mean, I don't know.
Maybe we're on different paths right now.

1179
01:24:56,634 --> 01:24:58,719
You know? I don't know.

1180
01:24:58,970 --> 01:25:00,304
Maybe we're just...

1181
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:02,348
...going different ways. I don't...

1182
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:04,684
I've gotta go. I gotta go.

1183
01:25:08,104 --> 01:25:08,813
Gwen.

1184
01:25:11,941 --> 01:25:13,109
Good luck.

1185
01:25:16,654 --> 01:25:18,948

1193
01:26:58,339 --> 01:26:59,632
Mr. Osborn?

1194
01:27:01,467 --> 01:27:02,510
You all right?

1195
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:05,262
Is there anything I can get you?

1196
01:27:05,513 --> 01:27:08,516
No, not unless you can bring
those spiders back to life.

1197
01:27:09,183 --> 01:27:10,226
Spiders?

1198
01:27:10,476 --> 01:27:12,436
The ones that they destroyed...

1199
01:27:13,604 --> 01:27:16,774
..."to restore investor confidence."

Harry.

1203
01:27:27,034 --> 01:27:30,830
I think there may be another way
to get what you're looking for.

1204
01:27:33,124 --> 01:27:37,461
I overheard Menken talking
with one of our security heads.

1205
01:27:38,546 --> 01:27:40,339
Before they destroyed the spiders...

1206
01:27:41,298 --> 01:27:42,925
...they had the venom extracted.

1207
01:27:45,636 --> 01:27:46,720
What?

1208
01:27:49,014 --> 01:27:50,433
What are you saying?

1209
01:27:50,683 --> 01:27:52,518
That way, they could comply
with the lawsuits...

1210
01:27:52,768 --> 01:27:55,604
...but still keep the data
in case it ever became useful.

1211
01:27:56,981 --> 01:27:57,982
Where is it?

1212
01:27:58,357 --> 01:28:00,151
It's somewhere in the building.

1213
01:28:01,652 --> 01:28:05,197
It's somewhere off-books

He's busy.

What did you do?

1232
01:28:57,791 --> 01:29:00,211
The more relevant question is
what did you do?

1233
01:29:00,461 --> 01:29:04,507
An employee is killed and in your
first action as CEO, you cover it up.

1234
01:29:04,757 --> 01:29:09,136
No, you covered it up. Then you buried
him in the bughouse using my name.

1235
01:29:09,386 --> 01:29:13,182
Ravencroft is a timeworn institution
devoted to mental improvement.

1236
01:29:13,432 --> 01:29:15,351
You are experimenting on people in there.

Progress has its stepping stones.

1238
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:20,814
Now, in light of your deceptive
criminal actions, you've been...

1239
01:29:21,065 --> 01:29:22,650
How do I put this gently?

1240
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:23,901
...fired.

1241
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:27,279
You are not going to bury me too.

1242
01:29:27,530 --> 01:29:30,199
Looks to me like you're halfway
in the ground already.

1243
01:29:30,991 --> 01:29:32,618
It's only a matter of time.

1244
01:29:33,285 --> 01:29:35,538
You're going to die a horrible death.

1245
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:37,540
Like your father.

1246
01:29:38,207 --> 01:29:39,750

1247
01:29:40,209 --> 01:29:42,086
...no one is going to miss you.

1248
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,131
Get him out.

1249
01:29:46,382 --> 01:29:47,383
Wait. Wait.

1250
01:29:54,723 --> 01:29:56,392
I know my way out.

1251
01:30:07,111 --> 01:30:08,654
A hundred dollars.
Can you believe that?

1252
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:11,073
Tell you why, you should put
the lid on that but quick.

1253
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:12,658
I tried. Good luck.

1254

1269
01:33:23,390 --> 01:33:25,559
Yeah, you can open the gate.

1270
01:33:25,809 --> 01:33:27,102
I'm Harry Osborn.

1271
01:33:27,352 --> 01:33:31,356
Now, there's a patient in that
Isolation Wing that I need to see.

1272
01:33:31,607 --> 01:33:34,485
Joe, this is Mr. Osborn of Oscorp.

1273
01:33:34,735 --> 01:33:37,321
Sorry, without a yellow badge,
I can't let anyone past this point.

1274
01:33:41,033 --> 01:33:43,452
<i>But it doesn't matter
because there's something else...</i>

1275
01:33:44,495 --> 01:33:46,288
<i>...that Norman doesn't know.</i>

1276
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:49,500
<i>The human DNA...</i>

1277
01:33:50,083 --> 01:33:52,628
<i>...that I implanted in the spiders...</i>

1278
01:33:54,505 --> 01:33:55,631
<i>...was my own.</i>

1279
01:33:58,133 --> 01:34:00,427
<i>Which means that without me...</i>

1280
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:02,346
<i>...without my bloodline...</i>

1281
01:34:03,013 --> 01:34:07,226
<i>...Oscorp can never replicate
or continue my experiments.</i>

1282
01:34:07,643 --> 01:34:10,020
Keep Electro incubated...

1283
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:14,441
...with 400 milligrams of sodium
thiopental <i>und</i> phenobarbital.

1284
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:20,405
<i>I have destroyed as much
as possible from the archives.</i>

1285
01:34:20,656 --> 01:34:22,616
<i>But I didn't have time
to kill all of the spiders.</i>

1286
01:34:22,866 --> 01:34:26,078
<i>So as a scientist,
my choice is very clear now.</i>

1287
01:34:26,328 --> 01:34:30,123
<i>I have to disappear. I have to get
as far away from here as I can.</i>

1288
01:34:30,374 --> 01:34:32,167
<i>But as a father...</i>

1289
01:34:32,543 --> 01:34:35,671
<i>...it means I may not see my boy again.</i>

1290
01:34:35,921 --> 01:34:40,008
<i>And nothing is as important to me...</i>

1291
01:34:40,759 --> 01:34:42,761
<i>...as my son, Peter.</i>

1292
01:34:43,136 --> 01:34:44,888
<i>Nothing in this world.</i>

1293
01:34:45,514 --> 01:34:47,474
<i>But I have a responsibility...</i>

1294
01:34:47,724 --> 01:34:49,768
<i>...to protect the world
from what I've created...</i>

1295
01:34:50,018 --> 01:34:52,980
<i>...and to protect him from what
I know Osborn is capable of.</i>

1296
01:34:53,856 --> 01:34:56,233
<i>People will say I am a monster...</i>

1297
01:34:57,234 --> 01:34:58,819
<i>...for what I've done.</i>

1298
01:35:00,529 --> 01:35:02,030
<i>And maybe they're right.</i>

1299
01:35:04,783 --> 01:35:06,910
<i>I always thought that I'd have more...</i>

1300
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:08,245
<i>...time.</i>

1301
01:35:08,495 --> 01:35:10,372
<i>Dad? Dad!</i>

1302
01:35:10,622 --> 01:35:11,915
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1303
01:35:30,851 --> 01:35:32,436
<i>Sedation off.</i>

1304
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:41,361
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1305
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:43,780
All right? But we don't have much time.

1306
01:35:44,698 --> 01:35:45,699
Who are you?

1307
01:35:45,949 --> 01:35:49,077
I'm Harry Osborn.
I wanna make you a deal.

1308
01:35:50,871 --> 01:35:52,122
I should kill you.

1309
01:35:52,372 --> 01:35:54,082
Oh, come on.

1310
01:35:54,583 --> 01:35:56,501
Think bigger, Max.

1311
01:35:56,752 --> 01:35:58,754
I'm not the one you want.

1312
01:35:59,004 --> 01:36:00,297
You want Spider-Man.

1313
01:36:01,798 --> 01:36:03,634
And I can give him to you.

1314
01:36:06,345 --> 01:36:08,555
But I need something first.

1315
01:36:09,932 --> 01:36:12,142
I need you to get me into Oscorp.

1316
01:36:12,601 --> 01:36:14,019
Get you in?

1317
01:36:14,478 --> 01:36:15,938
You own it.

1318
01:36:17,189 --> 01:36:18,190
Not anymore.

1319
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:19,691
Oscorp betrayed us both...

1320
01:36:19,942 --> 01:36:23,779
...so I can't get in there without you
and you can't get out of here without me.

1321
01:36:24,738 --> 01:36:27,324
- What's happening?
- Someone pulled an alarm in the Iso Unit.

1322
01:36:27,574 --> 01:36:30,118
Get a containment team up there now.

1323
01:36:30,786 --> 01:36:32,496
You couldn't possibly know what I want.

1324
01:36:32,746 --> 01:36:34,456
You submitted the design for the grid...

1325
01:36:34,706 --> 01:36:36,583
...and they stole it.
And now you want it back.

1326
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:38,627
You just wanna take back what's yours.

1327
01:36:38,877 --> 01:36:41,588
- How?
- It is all the power in the city, Max...

1328
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:43,757
...and it's right at your fingertips.

1329
01:36:44,007 --> 01:36:45,801
And then once you shut down the grid...

1330
01:36:46,051 --> 01:36:49,972
...Spider-Man will come to you,
and I want you to make him bleed.

1331
01:36:51,932 --> 01:36:52,975
Break it! Break it!

1332
01:36:56,061 --> 01:36:57,646
Max, we don't have much time!

1333
01:36:57,896 --> 01:37:00,232
Go! Go, go! Go!

1334
01:37:00,482 --> 01:37:02,526
Give me one reason
why I should trust you.

1335
01:37:02,776 --> 01:37:03,819
Because I need you!

1336
01:37:05,737 --> 01:37:06,738
You need me?

1337
01:37:06,989 --> 01:37:09,908
Yes. I need you.

1338
01:37:10,242 --> 01:37:14,287
You are my only chance
that I have at surviving.

1339
01:37:14,538 --> 01:37:15,455
You need me?

1340
01:37:15,706 --> 01:37:17,624
Yes. I need you.

1341
01:37:18,709 --> 01:37:19,876
I need you. Please! Please!

1342
01:37:21,753 --> 01:37:22,796
Please!

1343
01:37:23,130 --> 01:37:25,007
I know what it's like to be thrown away!

1344
01:37:25,257 --> 01:37:26,258
Please, Max!

1345
01:37:26,508 --> 01:37:28,427
I need you! I need you!

1346
01:38:18,852 --> 01:38:19,853
No!

1347
01:38:23,899 --> 01:38:25,525
You wanna be my friend?

1348
01:38:26,193 --> 01:38:28,361
I thought we were already friends.

1349
01:38:29,988 --> 01:38:31,406
I had a friend once.

1350
01:38:32,491 --> 01:38:34,242
It didn't work out.

1351
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:36,453
Yeah. Me too.

1352
01:38:37,954 --> 01:38:40,040
Then let's go catch a spider.

1353
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:45,962
<i>You have one new voice message.</i>

1354
01:38:48,256 --> 01:38:50,050
<i>Hi, Peter, it's me.</i>

1355
01:38:52,177 --> 01:38:54,971
<i>I got in to Oxford.</i>

1356
01:38:56,139 --> 01:38:59,059
<i>It's very exciting.</i>

1357
01:38:59,559 --> 01:39:02,896
<i>I came by your house
a little bit ago and I...</i>

1358
01:39:03,522 --> 01:39:04,564
<i>You weren't there...</i>

1359
01:39:04,815 --> 01:39:08,193
<i>...and so I'm on my way
to the airport right now...</i>

1360
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:11,113
<i>...because there's this early summer
class that I found out about...</i>

1361
01:39:11,363 --> 01:39:14,449
<i>...and I thought that it would somehow...</i>

1362
01:39:14,825 --> 01:39:18,829
<i>...be easier, I guess, this way.</i>

1363
01:39:19,412 --> 01:39:22,833
<i>I think that maybe it's time...</i>

1364
01:39:23,083 --> 01:39:25,252
<i>...to let this go.</i>

1365
01:39:25,919 --> 01:39:28,213
<i>And that's not because I don't love you.</i>

1366
01:39:28,463 --> 01:39:31,758
<i>It's actually because I do, so...</i>

1367
01:39:32,384 --> 01:39:33,760
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

1368
01:39:48,275 --> 01:39:50,694
- We have to move, now.
- Why? What's happened?

1369
01:40:03,623 --> 01:40:05,250
Remember me?

1370
01:40:09,629 --> 01:40:10,964
Oh, my, oh, my.

1371
01:40:11,214 --> 01:40:13,175
How the tables have turned.

1372
01:40:13,758 --> 01:40:16,136
I know it's hard to admit...

1373
01:40:16,386 --> 01:40:20,724
...but how spectacular a move is this?

1374
01:40:21,975 --> 01:40:24,561
- Am I right?
- Right as rain.

1375
01:40:26,188 --> 01:40:28,815
Okay, so, Fairy Godmother...

1376
01:40:29,065 --> 01:40:31,860
...it is time to grant me a wish.

1377
01:40:32,110 --> 01:40:36,323
- I want in to Special...
- How dare you come back in here?

1378
01:40:37,532 --> 01:40:40,994
You recalcitrant, unworthy, defective...

1379
01:40:41,244 --> 01:40:43,205
...urchin freaks.

1380
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:50,962
Oh, God, I'm sorry. That's just not
the answer we were looking for.

1381
01:41:04,601 --> 01:41:05,644
Clear.

1382
01:41:07,479 --> 01:41:10,023
Welcome back to the bonus round.

1383
01:41:11,566 --> 01:41:14,945
Hey, let's take a walk, shall we?

1384
01:41:19,282 --> 01:41:22,118
The grid is all yours.

1385
01:41:54,359 --> 01:41:56,820
The spider venom. Give it to me.

1386
01:42:02,826 --> 01:42:04,244
What is all this stuff?

1387
01:42:04,494 --> 01:42:05,996
The future.

1388
01:42:19,759 --> 01:42:20,969
Load one up.

1389
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:26,808
It won't work.

1390
01:42:27,058 --> 01:42:30,729
We ran every diagnostic test
apart from human trials.

1391
01:42:30,979 --> 01:42:34,941
You've actually already run human trials.
You're just too stupid to know it.

1392
01:42:38,987 --> 01:42:41,031
Do it. Now.

1393
01:43:00,675 --> 01:43:03,178
You had it all this time.

1394
01:44:32,350 --> 01:44:33,768
It's Spider-Man.

1395
01:44:39,691 --> 01:44:40,859
Stop the cab.

1396
01:44:41,109 --> 01:44:43,153
Lady, I ain't even moving.

1397
01:45:13,766 --> 01:45:15,310
- Hi.
- Hi.

1398
01:45:16,019 --> 01:45:17,770
- Did you get my message?
- What message?

1399
01:45:18,021 --> 01:45:20,690
- The message right there.
- Oh, that. That was you?

1400
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:22,734
- Don't do that.
- I couldn't make it out.

1401
01:45:22,984 --> 01:45:25,111
I'll tell you what it says.
Says, "I love you."

1402
01:45:26,779 --> 01:45:28,490
Because I love you.

1403
01:45:29,532 --> 01:45:31,951
- And no offense, but you're wrong.
- I'm wrong about what?

1404
01:45:32,202 --> 01:45:34,037
You're wrong about us
being on different paths.

1405
01:45:34,287 --> 01:45:36,623
We're not on different paths.
You're my path.

1406
01:45:37,707 --> 01:45:39,876
And you're always gonna be my path.

1407
01:45:40,835 --> 01:45:44,380
And I know there's a million reasons why
we shouldn't be together. I know that.

1408
01:45:44,714 --> 01:45:46,382
But I'm tired of them.

1409
01:45:49,010 --> 01:45:51,304
I'm tired of every single one of them.

1410
01:45:51,804 --> 01:45:53,723
We've all gotta make a choice.

1411
01:45:55,642 --> 01:45:57,101
Right? Well, I choose you.

1412
01:45:59,729 --> 01:46:00,980
So...

1413
01:46:01,231 --> 01:46:02,774
...here's my thought.

1414
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:05,735
England.

1415
01:46:07,070 --> 01:46:08,404
Both of us.

1416
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:11,866
I'm following you now.

1417
01:46:12,408 --> 01:46:14,244
I'm just gonna follow you everywhere.

1418
01:46:14,827 --> 01:46:16,788
I'm just gonna follow you
the rest of my life.

1419
01:46:17,956 --> 01:46:21,167
I mean, they got crime there in England.

1420
01:46:21,417 --> 01:46:23,086
- Yeah.
- They got tons of crime, it seems.

1421
01:46:23,336 --> 01:46:25,255
- Tons.
- They got...

1422
01:46:25,922 --> 01:46:27,465
...Jack the Ripper.

1423
01:46:28,299 --> 01:46:29,300
What?

1424
01:46:29,551 --> 01:46:32,095
They haven't caught Jack the Ripper yet.
You didn't know that?

1425
01:46:52,156 --> 01:46:53,324
What the hell is that?

1426
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:05,503
Is that Max?

1427
01:47:06,087 --> 01:47:08,339
He must have cut the power
to the whole city.

1428
01:47:16,931 --> 01:47:18,641
PNA 322, you are...

1429
01:47:19,017 --> 01:47:21,060
- I'm black.
- I have nothing.

1430
01:47:21,311 --> 01:47:23,646
Hey, I need Tech Ops up here right now.

1431
01:47:23,896 --> 01:47:26,399
The phones are down.
Somebody go down and grab Tech Ops.

1432
01:47:26,774 --> 01:47:28,568
Hey, write down what you
remember, people.

1433
01:47:28,818 --> 01:47:32,572
There's gotta be some kind of blackout
plan, right? Some kind of backup?

1434
01:47:32,822 --> 01:47:35,658
There's an emergency reset
at the power plant.

1435
01:47:35,908 --> 01:47:38,745
If he cuts the transmission lines,
they're never gonna get this back up.

1436
01:47:38,995 --> 01:47:41,664
How will I stop him? Every time I get
close, he fries my web shooters.

1437
01:47:41,914 --> 01:47:43,875
- Have you tried grounding them?
- Tried everything.

1438
01:47:44,125 --> 01:47:46,169
- Rubber, plastic...
- Did you try magnetizing them?

1439
01:47:46,419 --> 01:47:48,880
I didn't try magnetizing them.

1440
01:47:49,130 --> 01:47:51,299
Okay, well, remember
8th grade science class?

1441
01:47:51,966 --> 01:47:54,594
If you magnetize a nail with a battery...

1442
01:47:55,011 --> 01:47:56,888
- It holds an electric charge.
- Yes.

1443
01:47:59,265 --> 01:48:02,477
New York Approach.
This is Pan National 273 on approach.

1444
01:48:02,727 --> 01:48:04,020
How do you hear?

1445
01:48:05,021 --> 01:48:06,356
Approach, do you copy?

1446
01:48:06,606 --> 01:48:08,566
Radio's working. It's not us.

1447
01:48:15,490 --> 01:48:20,161
Do not panic.
Everyone, please return to your vehicles.

1448
01:48:20,411 --> 01:48:22,288
Go back to your cars.

1449
01:48:22,747 --> 01:48:23,956
Remain calm.

1450
01:48:25,416 --> 01:48:28,002
Do not panic.
Everyone return to your vehicles.

1451
01:48:28,252 --> 01:48:29,712
- Go into your homes.
- Officer!

1452
01:48:30,129 --> 01:48:31,255
Spider-Man!

1453
01:48:31,506 --> 01:48:33,758
My father was Captain George Stacy
of the 19th Precinct.

1454
01:48:34,008 --> 01:48:36,761
- I knew who he was. What can we do?
- Jumper cables.

1455
01:48:37,011 --> 01:48:39,138
- Jumper cables?
- Yes. And copper wire.

1456
01:48:39,389 --> 01:48:41,808
Am I talking louder than I
usually talk right now?!

1457
01:48:42,558 --> 01:48:43,559
Yes.

1458
01:48:44,394 --> 01:48:46,104
- Your suit'll ground you.
- All right, do it.

1459
01:48:49,816 --> 01:48:52,694
Okay, good. Try, try, try.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1460
01:48:52,944 --> 01:48:53,945
Okay, it works, good.

1461
01:48:54,195 --> 01:48:55,863
That is why you were
number two at Midtown.

1462
01:48:56,114 --> 01:48:56,906
Rub it in. Okay.

1463
01:48:59,367 --> 01:49:00,952
- I gotta go.
- I'm coming with you.

1464
01:49:01,202 --> 01:49:03,037
- You're not coming with me.
- Yes, I am.

1465
01:49:03,287 --> 01:49:04,539
- It's too dangerous.
- I'm coming.

1466
01:49:04,789 --> 01:49:07,208
I've seen the grid specs and I know
how to reset the system.

1467
01:49:07,458 --> 01:49:11,421
- I'm coming with you! You need me!
- Okay, shut up. You're coming with me!

1468
01:49:11,671 --> 01:49:12,922
Shut the thing.

1469
01:49:13,297 --> 01:49:15,049
Sorry. I love you. Don't hate me.

1470
01:49:16,843 --> 01:49:18,177
Peter!

1471
01:49:18,428 --> 01:49:20,263
We still don't have backup generators.

1472
01:49:20,513 --> 01:49:21,889
Get me Engineering!

1473
01:49:22,265 --> 01:49:23,433
I need a respirator right now.

1474
01:49:23,683 --> 01:49:25,518
They're battery-operated. I'll get it.

1475
01:49:25,768 --> 01:49:26,936
Hang on.

1476
01:49:27,687 --> 01:49:28,730
Okay.

1477
01:49:51,544 --> 01:49:53,796
<i>Do you see me now, Spider-Man?</i>

1478
01:49:54,088 --> 01:49:57,341
<i>It's time to meet our destiny.</i>

1479
01:50:12,482 --> 01:50:14,901
Tower, we're experiencing some
kind of electrical disturbance.

1480
01:50:15,151 --> 01:50:17,653
Instruments are going haywire.
Radar is down.

1481
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:20,323
We're flying blind out here.
Do you copy?

1482
01:50:24,952 --> 01:50:27,371
Tower, repeat: We are standby only.
What is happening?

1483
01:50:27,622 --> 01:50:30,875
Sir? There are two inbound flights
on intersecting paths.

1484
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:32,835
- Time to impact?
- Four and a half minutes.

1485
01:50:33,085 --> 01:50:34,212
Clock it right now.

1486
01:50:48,184 --> 01:50:50,353
You're too late, Spider-Man.

1487
01:50:50,686 --> 01:50:52,355
I designed this power grid.

1488
01:50:52,605 --> 01:50:54,190
Now I'm gonna take back...

1489
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:56,150
...what is rightfully mine.

1490
01:50:56,526 --> 01:50:58,694
I will control everything.

1491
01:50:58,945 --> 01:51:02,573
And I will be like a god to them.

1492
01:51:02,824 --> 01:51:04,116
A god named Sparkles?

1493
01:51:14,460 --> 01:51:15,753
Not this time.

1494
01:51:16,128 --> 01:51:18,589
Is that all you got? Come on!

1495
01:51:37,692 --> 01:51:38,860
Come on!

1496
01:51:43,114 --> 01:51:44,323
You ready to give up?

1497
01:51:54,959 --> 01:51:57,461
Oh, thank you, Gwen Stacy.

1498
01:52:08,139 --> 01:52:09,807
Just shake it off. It's just your bones...

1499
01:52:10,057 --> 01:52:12,184
...and your muscles and your organs.

1500
01:52:15,855 --> 01:52:17,315
Oh, boy.

1501
01:52:24,697 --> 01:52:25,698
I hate this song!

1502
01:52:46,677 --> 01:52:47,678
Spider-Man...

1503
01:52:48,095 --> 01:52:49,430
...bet you never saw this coming.

1504
01:52:57,104 --> 01:52:58,898
Really? You web me to a car?

1505
01:52:59,231 --> 01:53:00,524
What are you, a caveman?

1506
01:53:00,775 --> 01:53:01,984
You shouldn't be here.

1507
01:53:02,234 --> 01:53:04,820
You tie me up to go off to war?
I know how to help you!

1508
01:53:05,071 --> 01:53:07,198
- What are you doing here?!
- I know the grid specs.

1509
01:53:07,448 --> 01:53:08,741
I can reset the system!

1510
01:53:08,991 --> 01:53:11,202
You can't be here right now.
I'm not messing around.

1511
01:53:11,452 --> 01:53:13,162
You can't be here right now.
This is insane.

1512
01:53:13,412 --> 01:53:16,374
Nobody makes my decisions for me.
All right? Nobody.

1513
01:53:16,624 --> 01:53:18,668
This is my choice, okay?

1514
01:53:19,377 --> 01:53:21,796
My choice. This is mine.

1515
01:53:22,088 --> 01:53:23,339
Now, how do we stop him?

1516
01:53:23,589 --> 01:53:25,967
Okay, so he's electric,
he's like a battery.

1517
01:53:26,217 --> 01:53:27,885
What happens if you overcharge a battery?

1518
01:53:28,135 --> 01:53:29,136
- It explodes.
- Right.

1519
01:53:29,387 --> 01:53:30,972
So we use his power against him.
Perfect.

1520
01:53:31,222 --> 01:53:33,057
- Okay.
- I think I can reconnect the power lines.

1521
01:53:33,307 --> 01:53:34,767
But I need you to reset the system.

1522
01:53:35,059 --> 01:53:37,895
Okay, when I say you turn
that power on, you turn it on.

1523
01:53:38,145 --> 01:53:40,481
- No matter what. No matter what.
- Peter.

1524
01:53:45,486 --> 01:53:46,821
Go, go!

1525
01:54:38,873 --> 01:54:40,916
Sixty seconds to impact.

1526
01:55:15,534 --> 01:55:16,535
Now, Gwen, now!

1527
01:55:16,786 --> 01:55:17,912
Do it now!

1528
01:55:43,521 --> 01:55:44,688
Uni 687...

1529
01:55:55,825 --> 01:55:58,619
This is LaGuardia Tower.
Turn immediately to heading 280.

1530
01:56:00,037 --> 01:56:02,331
You have incoming traffic. I repeat: 280.

1531
01:56:02,581 --> 01:56:03,874
<i>Defend immediately.</i>

1532
01:56:19,390 --> 01:56:20,391
Yes!

1533
01:56:21,016 --> 01:56:23,227
All right, people, back to work.
Let's land these planes.

1534
01:56:23,477 --> 01:56:24,854
I'll be back in a minute.

1535
01:56:25,396 --> 01:56:27,648
Oh, thank God. All right!

1536
01:56:27,898 --> 01:56:29,942
All right, we're back.
Everyone, let's go.

1537
01:57:05,936 --> 01:57:07,730
I think we can still make your flight.

1538
01:57:16,572 --> 01:57:17,698
Gwen, stay there.

1539
01:57:43,766 --> 01:57:45,184
Peter.

1540
01:57:46,101 --> 01:57:49,271
When you said Spider-Man said no...

1541
01:57:49,772 --> 01:57:53,817
...you meant you said no.

1542
01:57:54,068 --> 01:57:56,487
Harry, what did you do?

1543
01:57:56,737 --> 01:57:58,739
What you made me do.

1544
01:57:59,281 --> 01:58:00,783
You were my friend...

1545
01:58:01,033 --> 01:58:03,577
...and you betrayed me!

1546
01:58:03,869 --> 01:58:04,995
No.

1547
01:58:05,454 --> 01:58:07,373
I was trying to protect you.

1548
01:58:08,123 --> 01:58:09,375
Look at me.

1549
01:58:09,625 --> 01:58:11,710
Hey, it's gonna be okay.
This is gonna be all right.

1550
01:58:12,127 --> 01:58:13,379
You don't give people hope.

1551
01:58:14,088 --> 01:58:15,631
You take it away.

1552
01:58:15,881 --> 01:58:16,924
No, Harry.

1553
01:58:17,508 --> 01:58:19,468
I'm gonna take away yours.

1554
01:58:19,718 --> 01:58:20,970
No. Gwen, run!

1555
01:58:21,512 --> 01:58:22,680
Harry!

1556
01:58:23,305 --> 01:58:24,640
Harry, put her down!

1557
01:58:41,532 --> 01:58:43,367
Harry, stop this right now!

1558
01:58:43,617 --> 01:58:46,328
This isn't you, Harry. This is not you.
Harry, put her down.

1559
01:58:46,912 --> 01:58:48,831
- Harry.
- Harry is dead!

1560
01:58:49,081 --> 01:58:52,042
Harry, this is between you and me.
You wanna fight?

1561
01:58:52,293 --> 01:58:54,336
Fight me! Let her go!

1562
01:58:54,878 --> 01:58:56,005
Okay.

1563
01:58:57,214 --> 01:58:57,840
No!

1564
01:59:06,140 --> 01:59:07,349
You okay?

1565
01:59:12,730 --> 01:59:14,982
I got you, Gwen.
I'm gonna put you down right here.

1566
02:00:35,229 --> 02:00:36,146
Peter?

1567
02:01:39,877 --> 02:01:42,087
Hey. Hey.

1568
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:46,383
Gwen?

1569
02:01:49,052 --> 02:01:50,053
Hey.

1570
02:01:50,429 --> 02:01:51,555
Hey!

1571
02:01:56,393 --> 02:01:57,478
Gwen?

1572
02:01:59,521 --> 02:02:00,522
Hey.

1573
02:02:04,067 --> 02:02:05,110
Breathe.

1574
02:02:06,653 --> 02:02:08,572
Hey, Gwen.

1575
02:02:09,573 --> 02:02:10,574
Hey.

1576
02:02:14,328 --> 02:02:15,370
Hey.

1577
02:02:17,789 --> 02:02:19,082
You're okay.

1578
02:02:22,836 --> 02:02:23,921
Gwen?

1579
02:02:29,843 --> 02:02:31,345
Stay with me, stay with me.

1580
02:02:31,595 --> 02:02:33,972
Stay with me, stay with me.
You stay with me.

1581
02:02:39,728 --> 02:02:40,812
Gwen.

1582
02:02:43,524 --> 02:02:44,566
Gwen!

1583
02:02:47,569 --> 02:02:50,113
No, please, please.

1584
02:02:52,658 --> 02:02:54,034
Please.

1585
02:03:00,916 --> 02:03:03,168
I can't do this without you.

1586
02:05:05,832 --> 02:05:07,250
Leave us.

1587
02:05:11,546 --> 02:05:13,131
You've made progress.

1588
02:05:13,382 --> 02:05:16,593
I've identified several worthy candidates.

1589
02:05:16,843 --> 02:05:18,929
Now that Spider-Man's gone...

1590
02:05:19,179 --> 02:05:22,224
...this city will never be the same.

1591
02:05:22,474 --> 02:05:25,018
Oh, I'm counting on that.

1592
02:05:25,268 --> 02:05:26,853
Speaking of progress...

1593
02:05:27,104 --> 02:05:28,146
...you're looking better.

1594
02:05:29,106 --> 02:05:30,941
It comes and goes.

1595
02:05:32,651 --> 02:05:34,111
Tell me more.

1596
02:05:34,695 --> 02:05:36,238
How many men did you have in mind?

1597
02:05:36,488 --> 02:05:38,490
I wanna keep it small.

1598
02:05:38,740 --> 02:05:42,160
Everything you need is already at Oscorp.

1599
02:05:44,037 --> 02:05:45,580
<i>Access granted.</i>

1600
02:05:45,831 --> 02:05:47,749
<i>Welcome, Mr. Fiers.</i>

1601
02:05:48,041 --> 02:05:49,751
<i>Who's our first volunteer?</i>

1602
02:05:50,001 --> 02:05:51,795
<i>Aleksei Sytsevich.</i>

1603
02:05:52,045 --> 02:05:54,214
<i>Currently serving a life sentence.</i>

1604
02:05:54,464 --> 02:05:55,674
<i>He is...</i>

1605
02:05:55,924 --> 02:05:58,176
<i>...most eager to join us.</i>

1606
02:05:59,010 --> 02:06:00,303
<i>Good.</i>

1607
02:06:00,971 --> 02:06:02,973
<i>Start with him.</i>

1608
02:06:03,473 --> 02:06:05,016
<i>Russian gangster Aleksei Sytsevich...</i>

1609
02:06:05,267 --> 02:06:07,185
<i>...was broken out of a classified penitentiary...</i>

1610
02:06:07,436 --> 02:06:10,605
<i>...known simply as the Vault
by an unknown team of men.</i>

1611
02:06:10,856 --> 02:06:13,275
<i>It's yet another example
of increased criminal activity...</i>

1612
02:06:13,525 --> 02:06:16,695
<i>...since the disappearance
of Spider-Man five months ago.</i>

1613
02:06:16,945 --> 02:06:20,198
<i>The web-slinger's absence has left
a hole in the heart of the city.</i>

1614
02:06:20,449 --> 02:06:23,034
<i>Believe it or not, even the New
York City Police Department...</i>

1615
02:06:23,285 --> 02:06:25,287
<i>...has joined the chorus
of New Yorkers in hoping...</i>

1616
02:06:25,537 --> 02:06:27,622
<i>...for the return of the web-slinger.</i>

1617
02:06:27,873 --> 02:06:30,041
<i>The entire world seems to be
asking the same question:</i>

1618
02:06:30,709 --> 02:06:32,794
<i>Where is Spider-Man?</i>

1619
02:06:34,087 --> 02:06:36,506
Too bad about that spider guy.

1620
02:06:38,049 --> 02:06:40,927
Too bad he's disappeared.
Seems like everybody really needs him.

1621
02:06:42,929 --> 02:06:44,222
Where you going?

1622
02:06:45,432 --> 02:06:48,101
- Eat my cereal.
- Peter.

1623
02:06:48,518 --> 02:06:50,187
Where you going?

1624
02:07:00,155 --> 02:07:01,198
I don't know.

1625
02:07:03,450 --> 02:07:05,160
You know, it's so funny. I've been...

1626
02:07:05,911 --> 02:07:08,747
I've been trying to clean up
around here, get organized...

1627
02:07:09,164 --> 02:07:13,376
...and been putting some
of Ben's stuff in boxes.

1628
02:07:14,169 --> 02:07:17,881
And it's so funny, the heavier
the box gets, the lighter I feel.

1629
02:07:18,632 --> 02:07:20,675
- You're throwing his stuff away?
- No.

1630
02:07:20,926 --> 02:07:22,135
No. God, no.

1631
02:07:22,511 --> 02:07:25,639
I couldn't do that. It's part of me.

1632
02:07:26,515 --> 02:07:29,476
I'm just finding...

1633
02:07:30,435 --> 02:07:31,895
...a better place for it.

1634
02:07:35,649 --> 02:07:37,567
I'm gonna take one last look...

1635
02:07:39,027 --> 02:07:40,654
...and I'm gonna put it where it belongs.

1636
02:08:05,929 --> 02:08:10,141
<i>It's easy to feel hopeful
on a beautiful day like today.</i>

1637
02:08:11,351 --> 02:08:14,229
<i>But there will be dark days
ahead of us too.</i>

1638
02:08:15,063 --> 02:08:17,607
<i>There will be days where
you feel all alone.</i>

1639
02:08:20,151 --> 02:08:22,571
<i>And that's when hope is needed most.</i>

1640
02:08:24,030 --> 02:08:26,074
<i>No matter how buried it gets...</i>

1641
02:08:26,908 --> 02:08:28,994
<i>...or how lost you feel...</i>

1642
02:08:29,244 --> 02:08:30,954
<i>...you must promise me...</i>

1643
02:08:31,204 --> 02:08:34,541
<i>...that you will hold on to hope.</i>

1644
02:08:36,251 --> 02:08:37,502
<i>Keep it alive.</i>

1645
02:08:38,420 --> 02:08:41,047
<i>We have to be greater
than what we suffer.</i>

1646
02:08:41,298 --> 02:08:42,757
<i>My wish for you...</i>

1647
02:08:43,008 --> 02:08:45,135
<i>...is to become hope.</i>

1648
02:08:45,594 --> 02:08:47,053
<i>People need that.</i>

1649
02:08:48,388 --> 02:08:50,348
<i>And even if we fail...</i>

1650
02:08:50,724 --> 02:08:52,767
<i>...what better way is there to live?</i>

1651
02:08:54,352 --> 02:08:56,104
<i>As we look around here today...</i>

1652
02:08:56,479 --> 02:08:59,691
<i>...at all of the people who
helped make us who we are...</i>

1653
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:02,819
<i>...I know it feels like we're saying goodbye.</i>

1654
02:09:03,361 --> 02:09:06,031
<i>But we will carry a piece of each other...</i>

1655
02:09:06,281 --> 02:09:09,034
<i>...into everything that we do next...</i>

1656
02:09:10,702 --> 02:09:13,705
<i>...to remind us of who we are...</i>

1657
02:09:15,582 --> 02:09:17,375
<i>...and of who we're meant to be.</i>

1658
02:09:19,669 --> 02:09:21,838
<i>I've had a great four years with you.</i>

1659
02:09:22,088 --> 02:09:24,090
<i>I'll miss you all very much.</i>

1660
02:09:46,488 --> 02:09:47,572
Let's go! Move it.

1661
02:09:55,956 --> 02:09:57,415
Get down! Take cover!

1662
02:10:01,252 --> 02:10:05,548
<i>I'm here live on Park Avenue and
56th Street where it is complete chaos.</i>

1663
02:10:05,799 --> 02:10:08,009
<i>A man in some sort
of weaponized armored suit...</i>

1664
02:10:08,259 --> 02:10:09,678
<i>...is wreaking havoc on Midtown.</i>

1665
02:10:13,723 --> 02:10:16,351
I am the Rhino!

1666
02:10:16,601 --> 02:10:19,020
I told you I would be back!

1667
02:10:30,281 --> 02:10:32,409
- No! No!
- A kid!

1668
02:10:37,622 --> 02:10:38,373
Hold your fire!

1669
02:10:38,999 --> 02:10:40,625
Everybody, hold your fire.

1670
02:10:41,459 --> 02:10:44,546
<i>- Unit 2, stand down. Stand down.
- Civilian in our line of sight.</i>

1671
02:10:48,508 --> 02:10:49,551
Kid! You gotta get...

1672
02:10:51,720 --> 02:10:53,513
Look, New York!

1673
02:10:53,763 --> 02:10:55,598
Spider-Man is back.

1674
02:10:56,182 --> 02:10:57,183
Leave the kid alone!

1675
02:10:57,434 --> 02:10:59,394
That's my baby! Please.

1676
02:11:02,439 --> 02:11:04,524
Brave boy.

1677
02:11:04,816 --> 02:11:07,152
Does Aleksei scare you, little boy?

1678
02:11:24,461 --> 02:11:25,962
Hey, Spider-Man.

1679
02:11:36,389 --> 02:11:37,682
I knew you'd come back.

1680
02:11:38,183 --> 02:11:40,518
Yeah. Thanks for stepping up for me.

1681
02:11:40,769 --> 02:11:42,854
You're the bravest kid I've ever seen.

1682
02:11:43,104 --> 02:11:45,815
I'm gonna take care of this jerk.
You go take care of your mom. Okay?

1683
02:11:46,066 --> 02:11:48,610
All right, get out of here. Go. Go.

1684
02:11:55,658 --> 02:11:56,826
You fight me?

1685
02:11:57,160 --> 02:11:59,204
You fight me now?

1686
02:12:00,246 --> 02:12:03,583
On behalf of the fine people of New
York City and real rhinos everywhere...

1687
02:12:03,833 --> 02:12:06,836
...I ask you to put your
mechanized paws in the air.

1688
02:12:07,087 --> 02:12:08,088
Never!

1689
02:12:08,338 --> 02:12:11,341
I crush you! I kill you! I destroy you!

1690
02:12:11,591 --> 02:12:13,093
You want me to come down there
so you can kill me?

1691
02:12:13,384 --> 02:12:14,385
Yes!

1692
02:12:14,636 --> 02:12:15,845
I'll be right there.

1693
02:12:16,221 --> 02:12:18,014
There's no place like home.
