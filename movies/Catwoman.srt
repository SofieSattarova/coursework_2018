1
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:42,263
It all started on the day that I died.

2
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,432
If there had been an obituary...

3
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,601
...it would've described
the unremarkable life...

4
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,271
...of an unremarkable woman...

5
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,690
...survived by no one.

6
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,650
But there was no obituary...

7
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:57,027
...because the day that I died...

8
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:01,240
...was also the day I started to live.

9
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,492
But that comes later.

10
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,589
This was my life.

11
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,884
Days blended together,
consistently ordinary...

12
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,596
...thanks to a job that was the practical
version of my passion.

13
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,931
- I'm sorry.
Watch where you're going!

14
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,559
I was supposed to be an artist by now.

15
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,019
Instead...

16
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:33,439
...I was designing ads for beauty cream.

17
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,030
- You are so addicted to that stuff, Sally.
- Happily.

18
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,158
- Beau-line is magic in a bottle.
- I don't know how you get it.

19
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:47,203
- It's not even in production yet.
- We have our ways.

20
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,081
- Hey.
- No!

21
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,543
Headaches again.

22
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,879
- My brain's all tight and cranky.

23
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:01,634
In one week, precisely, we will launch
the most exciting...

24
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,887
...and revolutionary product
to hit the beauty industry since...

25
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,556
...soap.

26
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,184
Beau-line.

27
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:15,064
Now, Beau-line doesn't
just hide the effects of aging...

28
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,816
...it actually reverses them.

29
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,318
However, with change...

30
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,779
...must come sacrifice.

31
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,906
My husband...

32
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:28,661
...and I have decided that
it's time for me to step aside...

33
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,496
...as the face of Hedare.

34
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,749
It has been a magnificent 15 years.

35
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:38,587
But we have decided to choose
a new face to represent Beau-line.

36
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,214
Exactly.

37
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,424
Drina.

38
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,010
The future of Hedare Beauty.

39
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,431
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I look forward...

40
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:53,853
...to seeing you at the gala, where you
can toast to Drina and our success.

41
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:57,648
Careful, George.
She's not old enough to drink.

42
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:07,032
You've got more talent than anybody
in the building, which I hate you for.

43
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,704
Sal, this is my first lead campaign.
It's gotta be perfect. You know that.

44
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,373
What is wrong with you?!

45
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,668
Good luck.

46
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,795
Yeah.

47
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:23,340
You simply couldn't resist it, could you?

48
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,552
You had to make
a scene out of it, Laurel.

49
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,095
What's the matter, George?

50
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,805
Did I steal your moment?

51
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,683
Come in!

52
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,201
Hi, Mr. Hedare...

53
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,704
Did you still want to see me, or...?

54
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,916
- Sit.
- Right. Okay.

55
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,756
I'm not pleased.

56
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,637
This isn't even close to what I wanted.

57
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,264
I can't imagine what on earth
you were thinking.

58
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,641
I am so sorry-

59
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:17,353
I mean, look at this red. It's all wrong.
I wanted it darker.

60
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,441
- I specifically heard you say-
- I know what I said.

61
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,611
- Okay. Maybe I misunderstood you.
- Clearly.

62
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,738
Mr. Hedare, I know I can fix it.

63
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,115
If you give me a chance,
I know I can fix it.

64
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,701
I do not reward incompetence.

65
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:38,415
I have no idea why I expected your art
to show better taste than your wardrobe.

66
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,710
Oh, and do try and get
a manicure, will you?

67
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,213
Oh, for God's sake, George.

68
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,924
Let her fix it.

69
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,926
She's good and you know it.

70
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,722
Whatever. By tomorrow night.

71
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,641
Midnight.

72
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,810
Right. Thank you.

73
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,359
Excuse me. Hi!

74
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:52,698
Do you think you could just
maybe turn the music down...

75
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,784
...just a little bit?

76
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,203
No? Okay.

77
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,047
Kitty! Kitty.

78
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:53,425
How'd you get up there?
Come down here.

79
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,971
What, are you stuck?

80
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,893
You're gonna make me come out there.

81
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,595
Hey! Easy! Hold on a minute!
Wait! Wait! Wait!

82
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,764
Whatever you're thinking or feeling...

83
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:44,143
...it's not worth it, you understand?
I'm a cop. Maybe I can help.

84
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,811
Okay. I'm fine.

85
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,646
- It's just that-
- Listen to me.

86
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,607
We'll get through this together.
What's your name?

87
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:54,319
Patience Philips. But this cat...

88
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:58,240
Sure, sure, Patience,
and it's a real beauty.

89
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,952
- Very cute.
- The cat's not up here anymore.

90
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,455
Okay. And I'm sure that
makes you very sad.

91
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,167
- What's your apartment number?
- Twenty-three!

92
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,585
Hold on!

93
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,505
Hurry.

94
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,137
I got you.

95
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,604
- You okay?
- Thanks.

96
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,027
You sure you're okay?

97
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,654
That was the cat.

98
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,198
You weren't kidding.

99
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,992
You actually climbed out there
to rescue your cat?

100
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,745
Yeah. I mean, no.
It's not my cat, it's a cat.

101
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,830
To rescue somebody else's cat?

102
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,957
Well, that's something else.

103
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,712
Oh, my gosh, I'm late for my job!

104
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,133
- I'm on a deadline today.
Yeah? Well, good luck with that.

105
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,509
Thanks.

106
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,470
Thank you!

107
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,430
After all, no one can defeat Father Time.

108
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,685
Though you did put up
a hell of a fight, didn't you?

109
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:54,189
Beau-line works wonders, doesn't it?

110
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,650
- Yes, it does.

111
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,485
I have a busy day today.

112
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:02,030
Drinks, then dinner.
Don't wait up, will you, darling?

113
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,534
I stopped waiting a long time ago, George.

114
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:08,620
Oh, and that lunch tomorrow?

115
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,832
- Cancel that too, will you?
- Problems?

116
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,792
I doubt it...

117
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,088
...but Slavicky won't stop calling.
You know scientists.

118
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:23,135
They're worse than models. You have to
coddle them all the time like little children.

119
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,805
I'll have Wesley reschedule. Bye.

120
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,119
Hey! Man sandwich, 12 o'clock.

121
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,831
Oh, my God.

122
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,631
Hello, Miss Philips.

123
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,550
Hi.

124
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:09,306
This is the officer I was telling you
about from earlier.

125
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,058
Detective Lone.

126
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,937
- Tom Lone.
- God, that is such a good name.

127
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,522
Tom Lone.

128
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,567
Rhymes with cone, phone, bone.

129
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,946
Not that rhyming's all that important.

130
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,867
I'll just be in my cubicle.

131
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,535
Alone.

132
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,834
- Hi.
- Hi.

133
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,421
How'd you get...?

134
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,757
You dropped something.

135
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,718
You can really cover a lot of ground
when you're in a hurry.

136
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,303
Thanks.

137
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,390
Is this yours?

138
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,934
Yeah.

139
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,811
- It's nice.
- Thanks.

140
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,855
Yeah, it kind of reminds me
of early Chagall.

141
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,399
Elegant, but whimsical.

142
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,567
Very much in the...

143
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,737
- ... tradition of the old Dutch Masters.
- I'm impressed.

144
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:10,534
Don't be. I noticed all the art in your
apartment, so I Googled it at the office.

145
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,578
- No, but really, I like it.
- Thanks.

146
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:19,084
Listen, I wanted to apologize about this
morning for thinking you were a jumper.

147
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,920
I was hoping to make it up
by taking you to coffee.

148
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:26,258
I know this great Italian place
around the corner, Grecchio's on 6th.

149
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:30,053
Or, listen, maybe tomorrow's better.
Say, 1:00?

150
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,098
Yes.

151
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,436
- Okay.
- Yeah?

152
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,396
Okay. So tomorrow then, 1:00.

153
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,107
- You make sure she gets there.
- Yes, officer.

154
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,568
- Counting on you.
- I screw it up...

155
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,778
...you can throw away the key.

156
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,699
See you tomorrow.

157
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,451
Okay, bye.

158
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,163
Patience.

159
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,291
- That is a man in serious like with you.
- You think?

160
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,127
- Hello.
- We got a lot of work to do.

161
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,254
First, you gotta shave those legs.

162
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:07,632
Second, wear that leather outfit
we got you for your birthday.

163
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,219
- Remember?
- First, it's only coffee.

164
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:17,184
And second, I will never, ever,
ever wear that leather outfit.

165
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,994
Good night!

166
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,751
Hi, this is Patience in the art department.

167
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:46,671
Yeah, I'm expecting a messenger
to come and pick up-

168
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,175
But it's gotta be there by midnight.

169
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,346
Well, I...
I know it's not your fault, but...

170
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,641
Okay.

171
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,935
I'll take it myself.

172
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,594
Hello? Is anybody in there?

173
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,522
Oh, come on, Slavicky.

174
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,524
When did you grow a conscience?

175
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:51,236
I don't care that the FDA never saw
the headaches...

176
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,989
...and the nausea and the fainting spells.

177
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,075
Those are symptoms I can live with.

178
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,080
Hello?

179
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:10,714
And with what we stand to make
from consumers demanding their fix...

180
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,966
...I can live with it being addictive.

181
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:16,094
But these side effects
from the long-term studies...

182
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,430
That won't happen if they keep using it.

183
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,265
And we'll make sure they do...

184
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,892
...because that's where
the money comes from.

185
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,978
I'm not sure anymore.

186
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,525
Hello? Hello?

187
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,123
I thought I could live with it...

188
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,419
...but I can't live with turning
people into monsters.

189
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:50,962
Oh, my gosh!

190
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,966
Let me pull the plug.
We can't let this go on the shelves.

191
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,094
Who's there?

192
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,098
Armando, come in.
- I'm on my way.

193
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,330
You can come out now. It's okay.

194
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,916
We'd just like to ask you a few questions.

195
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,836
Sorry.

196
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:35,298
But I think maybe I'm in the wrong-

197
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,178
- What are you doing?
- Don't ever do that again.

198
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,721
Where is she?

199
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,769
She ran down to waste treatment,
jumped in a pipe.

200
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,648
We don't know who she is,
but we know what she heard.

201
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,776
We can't risk it. Get rid of her.

202
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,905
Seal the door.

203
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,802
Patience,
I've never been so proud of you.

204
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,429
You're probably sipping
your decaf soy whatever...

205
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,265
...fantasizing about licking
the foam off his lips.

206
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,060
Wait, that's what I'm doing.
How'd the presentation go?

207
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:47,563
Did you get me free samples of it?
Listen, call me.

208
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,236
What...?

209
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,618
Hi, I'll take a decaf latte.

210
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:04,789
Hey, Patience, it's Tom Lone.
I'm here at Grecchio's waiting...

211
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,083
...and you're not here.

212
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:10,795
Anyway, I gotta
get back to work, so...

213
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,463
Bye.

214
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,774
Okay, kitty.
It's time for you to go home.

215
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,318
Now...

216
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,342
- Are you Ophelia Powers?
- Yes.

217
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,637
- I got your cat off a ledge and ever since-
- Why, Midnight.

218
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,891
You've never brought a stranger
home before.

219
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,018
Please, come in.

220
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:11,355
No, I can't come in.
I've got to go to- I'm late.

221
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,546
- Midnight.
- I'm sorry?

222
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,048
Her name.

223
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:42,637
She's an Egyptian Mau,
the rarest of breeds. Temple cats.

224
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,556
It's said that Maus have special powers.

225
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:48,392
Like popping out of nowhere?
I know.

226
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,353
Among other things.

227
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,234
Your cat...

228
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:58,653
Socrates!

229
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,696
No caffeine.

230
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,991
It makes him irritable.

231
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,994
You look a little out of sorts yourself,
my dear.

232
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,664
The cats, perhaps.

233
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:13,084
They seem to be taking quite
an unusual shine to you.

234
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:16,671
This has been a really bad day
for me already.

235
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:20,633
- I can't even remember most of yesterday.
- Perhaps I can help you.

236
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,551
Right.

237
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:26,305
This really isn't your problem.
I don't even know why I'm here.

238
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:29,517
- It's all right. Tell me.
- Really. I'm late for work.

239
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:33,896
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't even...
- Come back anytime. I'm always here.

240
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,409
Catnip.

241
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,209
No-

242
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:04,552
I'm fine. I am fine.

243
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,389
What the hell is wrong with you?!

244
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,309
You never delivered the design!

245
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,519
You don't even know where they are.

246
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:18,482
You do not know where they are because,
and I quote you, you "cannot remember"!

247
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,278
Your incompetence is staggering!

248
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,492
Are you even listening to me?

249
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,088
I'm sorry!

250
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:43,841
"Sorry"?

251
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,303
Sorry's not nearly enough.

252
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,388
Okay.

253
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,224
Then let me try the remix.

254
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,980
I'm sorry for every second I wasted...

255
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:03,235
...working for an untalented,
unethical egomaniac like you.

256
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:07,782
Clean out your cubicle. You are fired.

257
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,995
Wait! Mr. Hedare!

258
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,040
I didn't mean it.

259
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,335
Did I?

260
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,421
My hero.

261
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,723
Where did that come from?

262
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:46,570
I don't know, it's like I can't describe it.

263
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:50,491
I was saying it, but I wasn't saying it.
Do you understand?

264
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:53,786
Whoever said it has the thanks
of a grateful art department.

265
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:57,081
You don't understand, Sal.
I wanted to cause him pain.

266
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,753
I'm sorry.

267
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,588
- What was that?
- Allergies?

268
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,341
Maybe?

269
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,519
You just got fired, remember?

270
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,688
But it's so pretty.

271
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:26,277
Sal? Sal?

272
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,112
Sally?

273
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,239
Sally! Sally?

274
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:34,577
Hey.

275
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:38,789
Ever noticed when they keep you for
observation no one really observes you?

276
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:42,042
- Did they tell you what was wrong?
- Oh, they have no idea.

277
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,129
They did run a million fun tests, though.

278
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,381
Hey, upside, you gotta see my doctor.

279
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,633
I can see you're feeling better.

280
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:53,137
Reminds me, what's up with
the "hot yet modest, but who cares...

281
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,598
...because he's so hot" detective?

282
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,767
It's not gonna work out, Sal.

283
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,103
Patience, you never think
it's gonna work.

284
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:06,275
Because it doesn't. I've got a good
reason for saying it this time. Trust me.

285
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:09,487
Look, this time I refuse
to let you sabotage a good thing.

286
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,655
If it's broke, fix it.

287
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:15,910
All right? Now, I love you,
and he is gonna love you. Now, go.

288
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,245
Go give him some brown sugar.

289
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:21,165
I gotta meet my hottie doctor.

290
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,833
Tell me I look vulnerable.

291
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:28,005
Being good is something you keep
in your heart because you put it there.

292
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:31,675
I'm not saying it's easy. I'm not saying
some people don't choose to be bad.

293
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:35,012
But I want something different for you.
I want something better.

294
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,598
- You understand?
- Yeah.

295
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:41,644
- Can I see your gun?
- No. You know what makes somebody-

296
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,896
- Will you shoot it?
- No.

297
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,616
I want you to be
the good guys, got it?

298
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:58,536
Yeah.
- Let's go shoot some hoops.

299
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:10,297
I called the police station
and they said you might be here.

300
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:16,053
You never got your coffee.

301
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:23,686
Well, you're a brave man to be facing
a mob like this. No backup?

302
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:26,063
I'm used to working alone,
most of the time.

303
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,524
- Is that by choice, or-
- Yeah, theirs.

304
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:33,028
No, I've had partners before.
Turns out I take my job too seriously.

305
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,823
You know my friend Sally?
That's what she says about me.

306
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,701
She says that I'm fun-deficient.

307
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,036
- I don't believe that.
- That's what she says.

308
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:42,538
One-on-one?

309
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:45,416
- Who? Me and her?
- Yeah, come on.

310
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,377
You wanna do this?

311
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:51,547
One-on-one
One-on-one

312
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,442
I haven't done that since I was a kid.

313
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,277
Come on.

314
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,887
Come on.

315
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:43,682
Yeah!

316
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,173
Can we have our ball back?

317
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,302
You don't seem so fun-deficient to me.

318
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:38,362
Mr. Hedare wanted me to inform you
he'll be at the factory the rest of the day.

319
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,989
If by "factory"
you mean the Four Seasons...

320
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,534
...teaching Drina
to unlock the minibar...

321
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,620
- ... consider me informed.
- He'll be working with-

322
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:52,042
Wesley, George hasn't said anything
meaningful to me since he said "I do. "

323
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,246
- Hello?
- You'd think with the advances...

324
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:32,082
...in medicine, this place
would have a wet bar.

325
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:36,253
- Seems like you're feeling better.
- Some new medication I can't pronounce.

326
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:40,090
- So, what's up?
- Nothing. Just fixing a little snack.

327
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,427
What I'd like to know is
did you fix it with the cute cop?

328
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:48,891
- I think I did.

329
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,518
Details! And make it good, honey.

330
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,813
I'm sitting here in a paper dress,
for God's sakes.

331
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:58,442
All we did was talk.
And play a little one-on-one.

332
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,278
- You know how to play basketball?
- Apparently I do.

333
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:05,574
- I even went Shaquille on his butt.
- Patience, have I taught you nothing?

334
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,535
You never beat a guy at sports.
It messes them up.

335
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:11,455
They end up in a men's group,
banging on a drum.

336
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,999
It's not like I meant to.
It just happened.

337
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:20,047
I'm telling you, Sal, something really,
really weird is happening to me.

338
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,967
- I practically jumped him.
- That's called lust, sweetheart.

339
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,137
- Animal attraction.
- You think?

340
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,140
What if it gets worse?

341
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:36,230
- I mean, what if the next time-
- Next time? He asked you out again?

342
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:40,067
- I love this guy.
- So do I. But it's me I'm worried about.

343
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:44,655
- I felt like I couldn't be myself.
- Well, feel free to be me next time.

344
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:48,450
- Sally-
- I'm teasing. Just be yourself.

345
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:50,410
Myself.

346
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,913
Okay.

347
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,666
- I'll try.
- Oh, I gotta go.

348
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:59,002
Future father of my children's coming.
Sweet dreams, honey.

349
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:03,423
Excuse me. I think I might have a fever.

350
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,523
Hey!

351
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,526
- Shut that off!
- Get a life!

352
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:25,153
Yeah, get a life, you loser!

353
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:42,170
Sorry, babe. This ain't the slumber party.

354
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,090
However...

355
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,467
...in your case,
I can make an exception.

356
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,969
I'm flattered.

357
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,971
But do you think this one time...

358
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:55,017
...you could turn the music down
just a little...

359
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,894
...bit.

360
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,700
Tell you what, why don't I do it myself?

361
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:16,872
Hey! Hey! Listen, you freak-

362
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:24,254
I'm sorry, what did you say?
Is the music still too loud?

363
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,217
Hey!

364
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,729
You hear that? It's called silence.

365
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:44,399
That's all I ever wanted.
Now, keep it down.

366
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:48,070
Thanks for the party. I had fun.

367
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:36,493
- Time to accessorize.
My bike!

368
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,449
Amateurs.

369
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:09,503
You boys thought you could come in here
and steal all these beautiful things?

370
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:13,215
What a purr-fect idea.

371
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:39,342
Oh!

372
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:44,389
Meow.

373
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:00,632
That was one of a kind.

374
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:04,427
- From Egypt.
That's a hell of a profile.

375
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:07,430
Thieves said she jumps around like a cat.

376
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:11,351
What should we call her?
"Cat Chick"? No, no. "Cat Broad. "

377
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,271
What do you got?

378
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,542
Cupcakes.

379
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,355
Midnight.

380
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:55,580
I knew you'd come back
when you were ready.

381
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,638
The goddess Bast.

382
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:23,066
The Maus are sacred to Bast.
They're her messengers.

383
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:27,404
- You wrote this?
- I was a professor for 20 years...

384
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,781
...until I was denied tenure.

385
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,075
Male academia.

386
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:36,746
Bast is a rarity.

387
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:39,916
A goddess of the moon, and of the sun.

388
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:44,921
She represents the duality in all women.
Docile, yet aggressive.

389
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:47,757
Nurturing, yet ferocious.

390
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:52,137
But what does all of this
have to do with me? I mean-

391
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:54,931
What happened the other night?

392
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,352
- I don't remember.
- Do you want me to tell you?

393
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,187
Yes.

394
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:03,064
You died.

395
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,276
What?

396
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:09,362
I didn't die. Look at me, I'm right here.

397
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,489
You died.

398
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,576
- But you were reborn.
- Oh, you're crazy.

399
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:19,205
- You are a crazy cat lady.
- Midnight knew your fate.

400
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:23,793
That's why she tested you.

401
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:29,048
To see if you were worthy
of a gift she could give you.

402
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:32,552
A gift that could change your life...

403
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,888
...and give you a new one.

404
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:46,649
You're not alone, child.
He's saved others before you. Look.

405
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:55,533
Catwomen are not contained
by the rules of society.

406
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,120
You follow your own desires.

407
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:02,749
This is both a blessing and a curse.

408
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:06,628
You will often be alone
and misunderstood.

409
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:11,090
But you will experience a freedom
other women will never know.

410
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:16,095
You are a catwoman.
Every sight, every smell...

411
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:19,516
...every sound, incredibly heightened.

412
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:25,647
Fierce independence, total confidence,
inhuman reflexes.

413
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:30,485
- So I'm not Patience anymore?
- You are Patience.

414
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:33,196
And you are Catwoman.

415
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,750
Accept it, child.

416
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,753
You've spent a lifetime caged.

417
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:53,508
By accepting who you are,
all of who you are...

418
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:57,929
...you can be free.
And freedom is power.

419
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:22,245
You saved my life, Midnight.

420
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,414
But somebody killed me...

421
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:29,043
...and I've got to find out who, and why.

422
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:04,430
You dealt with Slavicky?

423
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,349
It's done.

424
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:42,343
Oh, my God. We danced all night.

425
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:01,696
- Been here all night.
- Absolutely.

426
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:03,948
Keep the change.

427
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,831
- What can I do for you?
- White Russian.

428
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:16,419
No ice, hold the vodka, hold the Kahlua.

429
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:24,594
Cream. Straight up.

430
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,184
Looking for something?

431
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:32,388
The other night you killed somebody.
She was a nice girl. Why?

432
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,184
Cat got your tongue?

433
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:43,024
I don't know. They told me to flush
the pipes so I flushed the pipes.

434
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,236
- Why?
- I don't know why.

435
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,906
Beau-line. There's something
wrong with Beau-line.

436
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,742
She heard something
she wasn't supposed to hear.

437
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:56,037
And Hedare is covering it up.

438
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:37,912
I can't live with turning people
into monsters.

439
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,311
Hey, hey, hey.

440
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:04,772
Wow!

441
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,483
You look amazing. Wow.

442
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,360
- Do you like it?
- Love it.

443
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:11,028
- Like the hair?
- Love the hair.

444
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:13,155
- Did good?
- You did real good.

445
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,824
This guy is good for you.

446
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:19,412
Aren't you glad I pushed you into it?
Props to Sally. Let me hear my props.

447
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,163
- Props to Sally.
- Yeah.

448
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:25,042
- Clothes, and a treat.

449
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:29,171
So are you gonna be okay, or what?

450
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:33,509
I do feel better. That's maybe laying off
the Cosmos for a couple days.

451
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:35,845
Check this out.

452
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:38,889
Some chick in a cat suit
murdered Slavicky last night.

453
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:43,019
The actions of this lunatic will not
keep Beau-line off the shelves.

454
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:46,313
We will launch next week as planned...

455
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:51,318
...because we owe it to the women
of this country.

456
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:55,156
- Because-
- Please. That guy is so full of himself.

457
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:58,117
- I'm almost out.
- Let's see.

458
00:58:58,285 --> 00:59:00,161
How long have you
been having headaches?

459
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:02,204
- About a month.
- Do me a favor.

460
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:03,873
- Stop using this.
- Why?

461
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:08,169
Because it's making you sick. Trust me.

462
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:16,052
Thank you, lieutenant.
You're gonna roll with him.

463
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:20,389
For Tom, from forensics.

464
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:24,185
Oh, and Slavicky homicide.
Maybe you'll want to look at that.

465
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,896
Hey, Bob, let me ask you a question.

466
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:30,649
Would your wife crawl out on the ledge
of a building to rescue a cat?

467
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:33,110
Maybe, if the cat was carrying a pizza.

468
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,251
Well, there are similarities.

469
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:53,589
- Shape of the S, harsh stroke of the R's.
- Were they written by the same person?

470
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:56,175
Well, it's not an exact science.

471
00:59:56,426 --> 01:00:00,846
But this first one. The broad spacing
of the letters? Indicative of loneliness.

472
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:05,059
And the O reaching out, insecure.
Handwriting of a people-pleaser.

473
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,770
Now, we look at the loop of the Y.

474
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:10,439
Very self-confident, almost angry.

475
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,943
And the O, well, this person
doesn't like to play by the rules.

476
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:16,112
- So they're different people.
- Very.

477
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:19,240
If you put these two women
in the same room...

478
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,617
...you're gonna have one hell of a party.

479
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:26,622
- You got a big weekend planned, Tom?
- I do now.

480
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,555
Aren't you supposed to let me win?

481
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:43,973
Not that kind of girl.

482
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:46,976
- What kind of girl is that?
- A loser.

483
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,603
Hey, can I ask you a question?

484
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:53,107
You work for Hedare, right?
Somebody was murdered at his factory.

485
01:00:53,275 --> 01:00:55,985
Hey! All right.

486
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:57,653
I'm sorry.

487
01:00:57,821 --> 01:01:01,240
Can you think of anybody who might
have a grudge against the company?

488
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:05,452
Lots of people. George Hedare isn't
the nicest guy in the world, you know.

489
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,496
He fired me.

490
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:14,211
What? Am I a suspect now, detective?

491
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:19,592
No.

492
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:41,822
Looks like we'll be
up here for a while.

493
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:45,826
You in a hurry?

494
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:07,890
Mom!

495
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:20,527
- Hey!
Don't move!

496
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:23,530
Hold on tight. I gotta stop this thing.

497
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,705
- Mom!
- Frankie.

498
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:37,503
Mom! Mom!

499
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:39,838
Help, Mom!

500
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:42,424
Mom!

501
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:50,933
Help, Mom! Help! Help!

502
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:24,758
You are one tough little guy,
you know that?

503
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:27,386
- Take it easy, partner.
Bye.

504
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:33,100
It's over.

505
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:37,146
Well, I'm not sure how you did it,
but I'm impressed.

506
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:40,816
Well, I saw how you did. And so am I.

507
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:42,484
You know what?
- What?

508
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:43,986
We should celebrate.

509
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:46,405
Why don't you let me
take you to dinner tonight?

510
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:50,284
I would love to, but I can't.
Not tonight. I've got...

511
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:54,621
...some business
that I have to take care of.

512
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,557
You picked the wrong house.

513
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:00,896
You're the cat that killed Slavicky.

514
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:03,690
You don't believe everything
you see on TV, do you?

515
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:06,568
- What do you want?
- Your husband. Is he home?

516
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,987
I'm here. Why on earth
would he be home?

517
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:10,739
Oh, too bad.

518
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:20,707
If your husband ever comes home,
tell him I know all about Beau-line.

519
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:24,336
It's disease in a jar.
I wouldn't caulk a sink with it.

520
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:29,258
- Come on. I've been using it for years.
- It's your funeral.

521
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:33,720
Because whoever killed Slavicky did it
to keep Beau-line's toxic little secret.

522
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:37,349
Are you suggesting that my husband
is a murderer?

523
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:39,560
I'm suggesting that
you tell me where he is.

524
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:42,354
- So I'll ask him myself.
- I suppose I should be shocked.

525
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:46,442
Protest his innocence. But the truth is...

526
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:49,111
...that man's capable of anything.

527
01:05:49,696 --> 01:05:51,447
You wanna find him?

528
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,534
There he is.

529
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:02,916
- Thanks.
- I'd like to help.

530
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:04,793
How can I reach you?

531
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,462
I'm not exactly listed.

532
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,422
Take my phone.

533
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:47,419
Call the cops.
You're not going to believe this.

534
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:50,422
I think this is a total waste of time.

535
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:53,008
- Don't.
- What?

536
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,302
Think. Ever.

537
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:58,931
Consider it a condition of our relationship.

538
01:07:09,234 --> 01:07:11,193
I love this part.

539
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:16,615
- Who the hell-?
- Like my nails?

540
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:19,993
- Just got them done.

541
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:23,205
Oops. My bad.

542
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,959
Get your paws off me this instant!

543
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:30,337
I know about Beau-line,
and your cover-up.

544
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:31,547
What?

545
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:35,509
So did my girl, Patience.
That's why you killed her.

546
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:39,555
- What? I didn't kill her-
- Too bad your last words will be a lie.

547
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,390
Freeze!

548
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:07,165
Hey!

549
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:10,460
Hold it right there.
Don't you move.

550
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:13,005
Now, come down from there
nice and easy.

551
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:16,091
Cats come when they feel like it.

552
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:18,677
Not when they're told.

553
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:21,597
I won't tell you again. You turn around.
Hands on your head.

554
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:44,077
You're under arrest.

555
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:01,470
Gotcha!

556
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:06,975
- You think this is a game?
- Now we're playing.

557
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:10,812
- You're playing. I'm at work.
- Seems like you love your job.

558
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:18,111
- Don't I get din-din first?
- I'll feed you in your cell.

559
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:38,674
Careful. That cable hits us,
we're both fried.

560
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:41,176
I knew I felt a spark between us.

561
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:50,310
- Not on the first date.
- Don't flatter yourself. I'm taken.

562
01:09:50,478 --> 01:09:52,479
- Does she know about us?
- There's no "us. "

563
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:57,317
Too bad.

564
01:10:01,114 --> 01:10:02,614
It's over.

565
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:16,378
There she is.

566
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:19,214
Okay, boys.

567
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:22,175
Show of hands.
Who can see in the dark?

568
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:25,303
I can.

569
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:38,233
But this is a disaster!
It's a total bloody disaster.

570
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:44,698
How does she know all this?
Who is she, anyway? And how come-?

571
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:46,575
It's all right.

572
01:10:47,285 --> 01:10:48,869
Don't be scared.

573
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:55,584
Great. You haven't got a clue, do you?
We are in absolute ruin here...

574
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:59,463
...and your brilliant piece of advice
to me is: "Don't be scared"?

575
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:03,759
No. My advice to you, George...

576
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:05,761
...quit the self-tanning.

577
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:08,513
Stop eating Viagra like they're vitamins.

578
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:13,602
Resist the urge to date children born the
same day they invented the cell phone.

579
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:17,564
For once, George, in your miserable life...

580
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,567
...be a man!

581
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:31,953
Terrific.

582
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:34,956
Beau-line works wonders, doesn't it?

583
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:38,043
Okay, Sal. What do you think?

584
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:44,466
I don't know. You going to a church
or a Playboy mansion?

585
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:46,384
Well, that was helpful.

586
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:49,304
I'm such a freak.

587
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:53,058
Please, I'm a freak Thursday
through Sunday, big deal.

588
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:55,811
Okay, but what if he doesn't like...

589
01:11:56,395 --> 01:11:59,439
- ... the real me?
- He can't pick and choose, Patience.

590
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:03,527
If he wants this to work,
he's gonna have to like all of you.

591
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:17,582
- Seсora Hedare. Perdуn.
Go.

592
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:27,801
Pretty.

593
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:30,512
Thanks.
- Oh, you too.

594
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,931
But I was talking about the fish.

595
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,560
Detective work is like dating.

596
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:40,647
It's all about the pursuit.
But when you catch them-

597
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:47,696
You like your sushi?

598
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:51,950
That's good.

599
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:59,624
So tell me about this one...

600
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:01,626
...that got away.

601
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:04,004
- Catwoman.

602
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:08,884
- You heard of her?
- Oh, yeah. Hot, black leather, whip.

603
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:10,802
She kissed me.

604
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:13,847
- Really?
- Yeah.

605
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:17,475
- What do you think about that?
- Depends.

606
01:13:18,019 --> 01:13:21,146
- You like bad girls?
- Only if they like me back.

607
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:26,860
No, listen, bad isn't something
that does it for me.

608
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:30,947
Okay, bad, good.
Gotta be something in between, right?

609
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:34,367
Maybe it's a little more complicated.

610
01:13:35,036 --> 01:13:38,079
- Why don't we talk about you?
- Okay.

611
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:42,417
- What's it like to be an artist?
- Well, I'm not really an artist.

612
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:45,545
I mean, yeah, I did go to art school...

613
01:13:45,713 --> 01:13:49,674
...but then I got a regular job
at an advertising agency...

614
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:56,097
...and now I don't really know
what I am anymore.

615
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:00,936
Well, I know what you are.

616
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:04,064
You're different.

617
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:06,733
You're special.

618
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:11,029
- And I like that about you.
- Thanks.

619
01:14:11,238 --> 01:14:12,781
No, it's true.

620
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:16,868
And I want to know more about you.

621
01:14:20,498 --> 01:14:23,500
You know, I guess there's a few things
I need to explain.

622
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:26,378
Like what, your new look?

623
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:30,507
- Your dunk shot?
- No, that's not what I was thinking.

624
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:32,342
Hey.

625
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:36,388
You can tell me anything.

626
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:46,022
I'm...

627
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:56,992
I hate the rain!

628
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:09,546
What were you saying?

629
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:14,175
Nothing important.

630
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:50,105
Tom?

631
01:16:58,364 --> 01:16:59,823
It's me.

632
01:17:01,325 --> 01:17:03,409
You were right about Beau-line's secrets.

633
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:07,956
I can't believe it, but you were right.
Beau-line is toxic.

634
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:12,502
I have proof. We can stop him,
but we have to stop him together.

635
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:16,714
George will be launching Beau-line
at a press conference tomorrow.

636
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:19,551
Beau-line will be on the shelves
on Monday.

637
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:10,852
So, what'd you find?

638
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:15,565
Enough evidence to put someone away
for a long, long time.

639
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:19,277
I was everything they wanted me to be.

640
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:22,947
I was never more beautiful.

641
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,158
Never more powerful.

642
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:29,287
And then I turned 40
and they threw me away.

643
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:35,001
It's all there behind the desk.

644
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:50,934
How'd I do?

645
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:55,396
The clawed-flesh thing
was a little tricky...

646
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:57,899
...but I think I pulled it off.

647
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:06,199
- You killed him?
- No one is gonna stop Beau-line...

648
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:08,243
...from hitting the shelves.

649
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,161
Not Slavicky.

650
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:14,582
Not George. And certainly not you.

651
01:19:15,668 --> 01:19:18,586
I'm sorry. I'm forgetting my manners.

652
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:20,713
Can I offer you something?

653
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:22,840
Can of tuna? Saucer of milk?

654
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:29,931
Smoking gun? Which, sweetheart, you
just emptied into my husband's chest.

655
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:35,270
Oh, George!

656
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:40,275
Help, somebody help!
It's Catwoman! She killed George.

657
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:43,528
Oh, my God!

658
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:58,019
Patience.

659
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:07,695
I'm sorry.

660
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:17,955
I guess you could take this right
out of my hands if you wanted.

661
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:24,712
If I wanted.

662
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:37,725
I'm telling you, Slavicky had evidence
that Beau-line was toxic.

663
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:39,644
That's why Laurel killed him.

664
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:43,398
George found out and she killed him too.
She was covering it up.

665
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:47,235
Ballistics show the same weapon killed
both men: the gun in your hand.

666
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:50,613
- Catwoman's hand.
- What's the difference?

667
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:55,827
- Guess it doesn't matter.
- Don't you understand?

668
01:21:56,412 --> 01:22:00,415
All of the evidence, every single piece,
it points to you.

669
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:03,084
There's nothing that shows me
anything else.

670
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:05,753
There's me.

671
01:22:06,713 --> 01:22:08,548
You can believe me.

672
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:18,266
Do you remember the first time
you saw me?

673
01:22:19,393 --> 01:22:20,601
Yeah.

674
01:22:21,145 --> 01:22:22,854
What did you see?

675
01:22:23,105 --> 01:22:24,439
A girl...

676
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:26,607
...rescuing a cat.

677
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:28,443
No, you didn't.

678
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:33,448
You saw a crazy person out on a ledge
trying to jump.

679
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:39,829
And all the evidence pointed to that,
didn't it?

680
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:43,291
I really need you to believe me.

681
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,380
How can I?

682
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:52,884
I don't know who you are.

683
01:22:57,931 --> 01:23:00,850
I'm the same girl
you were with last night.

684
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:20,745
Take her back.

685
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:36,010
You be a nice kitty, now.

686
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:02,370
Look at it this way, Lone.

687
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:06,207
You may have lost your woman,
but at least you got your man.

688
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:10,086
Did I?

689
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:11,754
Yeah.

690
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:19,303
Hello, Midnight.

691
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:41,701
You've spent a lifetime caged.

692
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:46,205
By accepting who you are,
all of who you are...

693
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:48,624
...you can be free.

694
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:50,585
And freedom is power.

695
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:56,257
It's not just about me anymore, Midnight.

696
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:08,561
You know...

697
01:25:08,979 --> 01:25:11,939
...Lassie would have brought me a key.

698
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:14,275
Cross your paws.

699
01:25:43,722 --> 01:25:46,849
We're gonna shift-change.
- All right.

700
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:52,855
- Dave's gonna take over then?
Yeah, as far as I know.

701
01:25:53,023 --> 01:25:54,940
Yeah, right through here, pal.

702
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:57,985
You'll get to talk to a lawyer.

703
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:20,383
Are you okay?

704
01:26:20,634 --> 01:26:23,552
A girl like me lands on her feet.

705
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:26,847
Wait! Wait!

706
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:39,235
My husband dreamed of a world...

707
01:26:39,403 --> 01:26:42,863
...where every woman could be
as beautiful as she wanted to be.

708
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:49,495
He dedicated his life pursuing that dream.
As Hedare's new chief executive...

709
01:26:49,663 --> 01:26:52,873
...I intend to make that dream a reality...

710
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:57,962
...by proceeding with tomorrow's launch
of Beau-line.

711
01:27:05,178 --> 01:27:06,554
Thank you!

712
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:15,104
Thank you so much. I have been dying
to get some of this stuff.

713
01:27:15,272 --> 01:27:19,608
My husband would have wanted you
to have it. He wanted that for everyone.

714
01:27:21,361 --> 01:27:24,739
- Detective Lone. What a surprise.
- Yeah?

715
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:30,411
Everyone, this is the man that brought
my husband's killer to justice.

716
01:27:33,582 --> 01:27:35,416
Can I talk to you, in private?

717
01:27:35,584 --> 01:27:37,918
Come upstairs to my office.

718
01:27:46,845 --> 01:27:49,555
Number five, ready to go.
Yeah, yeah.

719
01:27:49,723 --> 01:27:51,932
Yeah, go ahead. Right there.

720
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:03,778
Get a move on.
Gotta meet that midnight delivery.

721
01:28:42,192 --> 01:28:45,277
I saw her standing over him.
There were claw marks all over his body.

722
01:28:45,445 --> 01:28:48,322
- But not on Slavicky's.
- Because she didn't have the time.

723
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:50,533
She also didn't have a motive.

724
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:54,995
- I don't know.
- What if I told you I know the truth?

725
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:58,165
That I know who killed your husband,
I know about Beau-line.

726
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:02,002
Why, detective, you make it sound
like I'm a suspect.

727
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:05,339
What if I told you I had evidence?

728
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:11,554
If you have evidence,
then how come I'm not in cuffs?

729
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:16,016
Well, you're a smart woman,
Mrs. Hedare. Beautiful. Rich.

730
01:29:16,434 --> 01:29:18,602
I thought maybe we could
work something out.

731
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:24,024
So this evidence... You'll make it
disappear? Pin it on the other girl?

732
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:26,694
If that's what you want me to do.

733
01:29:27,529 --> 01:29:28,988
And you?

734
01:29:29,155 --> 01:29:32,199
- What do you want?
- You just gave me what I want.

735
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:34,326
You just told me it was you.

736
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:38,163
Now, why would you believe it was me?

737
01:29:39,749 --> 01:29:41,375
Because I finally trusted a friend.

738
01:29:41,543 --> 01:29:44,169
Yeah, well, your friend just got you killed.

739
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:49,216
Don't be stupid, Laurel.
You don't want to kill a cop.

740
01:29:49,759 --> 01:29:51,802
I'm a woman, Lone.

741
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:56,223
I'm used to doing all kinds
of things I don't wanna do.

742
01:29:56,558 --> 01:29:58,726
Give my regards to my husband.

743
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:06,859
How sweet.

744
01:30:07,027 --> 01:30:09,612
Thanks. Now I can kill you both.

745
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:32,009
Hold on, I gotta stop.

746
01:30:33,345 --> 01:30:34,595
How is it?

747
01:30:34,888 --> 01:30:36,847
Well, there goes my jump shot.

748
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:38,307
Listen.

749
01:30:38,642 --> 01:30:40,809
I want you to know I'm sorry.

750
01:30:40,977 --> 01:30:43,270
I should have trusted you all along.

751
01:30:43,730 --> 01:30:46,440
You're confusing me with somebody else.

752
01:30:46,775 --> 01:30:48,776
Come on, Patience.

753
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:55,783
I'll take this side.

754
01:31:54,718 --> 01:31:57,302
I can't believe I ever trusted you.

755
01:31:57,595 --> 01:32:00,889
- You're a fake.
- And what are you? A hero?

756
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:04,601
A thief?

757
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:07,980
A freak?

758
01:32:12,694 --> 01:32:16,238
If you don't have an identity,
why keep it a secret?

759
01:32:17,073 --> 01:32:19,616
Because you killed me.

760
01:32:24,706 --> 01:32:27,708
It was me you flushed down the pipes.

761
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:32,755
I'm Patience Philips.

762
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,507
That's who's under there?

763
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:10,125
- I can't be hurt.
- Beau-line.

764
01:33:11,002 --> 01:33:14,379
You stop using it
and your face disintegrates.

765
01:33:18,676 --> 01:33:22,930
And if you keep using it,
skin like living marble.

766
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:31,105
And you can't feel a thing.

767
01:34:03,429 --> 01:34:06,974
You're just a scared little girl
playing dress-up.

768
01:34:11,604 --> 01:34:13,939
Nobody. Nothing.

769
01:34:20,238 --> 01:34:22,364
Where do you think you're going?

770
01:34:25,368 --> 01:34:27,661
You're gonna look like a cop-killer.

771
01:34:27,996 --> 01:34:32,499
You wanted to save him.
Honey, you couldn't save yourself.

772
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:48,765
Game over.

773
01:34:49,601 --> 01:34:51,018
Guess what.

774
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:54,396
It's overtime.

775
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:40,400
Give me your hand!

776
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:44,863
Help me!

777
01:36:14,769 --> 01:36:19,147
I might not be a hero,
but I'm certainly not a killer.

778
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:24,152
You know...

779
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:26,947
...once Laurel's boys start talking...

780
01:36:27,115 --> 01:36:29,908
...we'll be able to wrap up
these murder cases pretty easy.

781
01:36:31,953 --> 01:36:35,455
And if Patience is back in her cell
by tomorrow morning...

782
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:39,001
...it'll be awfully tough to prove
that she was Catwoman.

783
01:36:41,462 --> 01:36:43,046
Exactly.

784
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:15,329
Delicious, thank you.

785
01:37:16,164 --> 01:37:18,498
You know, the strawberry was good too.

786
01:37:29,177 --> 01:37:31,803
The day I died
was the day I started to live.

787
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:37,809
In my old life, I longed for someone
to see what was special in me.

788
01:37:38,061 --> 01:37:42,731
You did, and for that
you'll always be in my heart.

789
01:37:42,982 --> 01:37:46,068
But what I really needed
was for me to see it.

790
01:37:46,486 --> 01:37:48,111
And now I do.

791
01:37:48,446 --> 01:37:50,030
You're a good man, Tom.

792
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:54,826
But you live in a world that has no place
for someone like me.

793
01:37:55,078 --> 01:37:58,705
You see, sometimes I'm good.
Oh, I'm very good.

794
01:37:58,873 --> 01:38:02,751
But sometimes I'm bad.
But only as bad as I wanna be.

795
01:38:02,919 --> 01:38:04,461
Freedom is power.

796
01:38:04,629 --> 01:38:10,217
To live a life untamed and unafraid
is the gift that I've been given...

797
01:38:10,385 --> 01:38:13,678
...and so my journey begins.
