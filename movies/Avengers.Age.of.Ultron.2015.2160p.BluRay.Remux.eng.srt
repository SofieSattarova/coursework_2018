1
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,794
Report to your stations immediately.

2
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:46,588
This is not a drill.

3
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,714
We are under attack!

4
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,092
We are under attack!

5
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,489
- Shit!
- Language!

6
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,199
Jarvis, what's the view from upstairs?

7
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,659
The central building is

8
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:00,287
protected by some kind
of energy shield.

9
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,247
Strucker's technology is well beyond

10
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,499
any other Hydra base we've taken.

11
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,920
Loki's scepter must be here.

12
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,214
Strucker couldn't
mount this defense without it.

13
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,717
At long last.

14
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,397
"At long last" is lasting
a little long, boys.

15
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,821
Yeah. I think we lost
the element of surprise.

16
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,616
Wait a second.
No one else is gonna deal with the fact

17
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,535
that Cap just said "Language"?

18
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,203
I know.

19
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,502
Just slipped out.

20
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,344
Who gave the order to attack?

21
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,763
Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers.

22
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,766
They landed in the far woods.
The perimeter guard panicked.

23
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,851
They have to be after the scepter.

24
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,438
- Can we hold them?
- They're the Avengers.

25
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,148
Deploy the rest of the tanks.

26
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,192
Concentrate fire on the weak ones.

27
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,694
A hit may make them close ranks.

28
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,114
Everything we've accomplished...

29
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,617
But we're on the verge
of our greatest breakthrough.

30
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,410
Then let's show them
what we've accomplished.

31
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,204
Send out the twins.

32
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,290
It's too soon.

33
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,501
It's what they signed up for.

34
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,003
My men can hold them.

35
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,513
Sir, the city is taking fire.

36
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,894
Well, we know Strucker's not gonna
worry about civilian casualties.

37
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,687
Send in the Iron Legion.

38
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,487
This quadrant is unsafe.
Please back away.

39
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,989
We are here to help.

40
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,493
This quadrant is unsafe.
Please back away.

41
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,329
Please back away.

42
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,540
- We wish to avoid collateral damage.
- Costel!

43
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,167
We will inform you
when this current conflict is resolved.

44
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,336
- We are here to help.
- Avengers, go home!

45
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,923
We are here to help.

46
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,843
We will not yield!

47
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:23,763
The Americans sent
their circus freaks to test us.

48
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,808
We will send them back in bags.

49
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:32,021
- No surrender!
- No surrender!

50
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,066
I am going to surrender.

51
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,152
You delete everything.

52
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,070
If we give the Avengers the weapons,

53
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,697
they may not look
too far into what we've been...

54
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,907
- The twins.
- They are not ready to take on...

55
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,243
No, no, I mean...

56
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,828
Twins.

57
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,064
You didn't see that coming?

58
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,698
Clint!

59
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,035
We have an Enhanced in the field.

60
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,161
Clint's hit!

61
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,042
Somebody want to
deal with that bunker?

62
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,297
Thank you.

63
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,890
Stark, we really need to get inside.

64
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,266
I'm closing in.

65
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,522
Jarvis, am I closing in?

66
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,441
Do you see a power source
for that shield?

67
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,110
There's a particle wave
below the north tower.

68
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,238
Great,
I want to poke it with something.

69
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,122
The drawbridge is down, people.

70
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,295
- The Enhanced?
- He's a blur.

71
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,965
All the new players we've faced,
I've never seen this.

72
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,758
In fact, I still haven't.

73
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,177
Clint's hit pretty bad,
guys. We're gonna need evac.

74
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,762
I can get Barton to the jet.

75
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,222
The sooner we're gone, the better.

76
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,515
You and Stark secure the scepter.

77
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,724
Copy that.

78
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,769
Looks like they're lining up.

79
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,563
Well, they're excited.

80
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,818
Find the scepter.

81
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,988
And for gosh sake, watch your language!

82
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,408
That's not going away any time soon.

83
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,499
Guys, stop. We gotta talk this through.

84
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,753
It was a good talk.

85
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,171
No, it wasn't.

86
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,263
Sentry mode.

87
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,517
Okay, Jarvis, you know. I want it all.

88
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,603
Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.

89
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,275
We're locked down out here.

90
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,944
Then get to Banner. Time for a lullaby.

91
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,742
I know you're hiding more than files.

92
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,579
Hey, J, give me
an IR scan of the room, real quick.

93
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,247
The wall to your left.

94
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,999
I'm reading steel reinforcement

95
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,877
and an air current.

96
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,211
Please be a secret door.

97
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,213
Please be a secret door.
Please be a secret door.

98
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:45,923
Yay.

99
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,108
Hey, big guy.

100
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,112
Sun's getting real low.

101
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,803
Baron Strucker.

102
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,222
Hydra's number one thug.

103
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,475
Technically, I'm a thug for S.H.I.E.L.D.

104
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,686
Well, then technically
you're unemployed.

105
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,771
Where's Loki's scepter?

106
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,815
Don't worry,
I know when I'm beat.

107
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,277
You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.

108
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,863
I'll put it right under
"illegal human experimentation."

109
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,532
How many are there?

110
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,415
We have a second Enhanced.
Female. Do not engage.

111
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,334
You'll have to be faster than...

112
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,175
Guys, I got Strucker.

113
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,762
Yeah, I got something bigger.

114
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,286
Thor,

115
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,039
I got eyes on the prize.

116
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,259
You could have saved us.

117
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,227
Why didn't you do more?

118
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,558
We're just gonna let him take it?

119
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,695
Hey, the lullaby worked better than ever.

120
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,366
Just wasn't expecting a code green.

121
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,533
You hadn't been there,

122
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,411
there would have been
double the casualties.

123
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,039
My best friend
would've been a treasured memory.

124
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,708
You know,
sometimes exactly what I want to hear

125
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,627
isn't exactly what I want to hear.

126
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,713
How long before you trust me?

127
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,425
It's not you I don't trust.

128
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,054
Thor, report on the Hulk.

129
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,099
The gates of Hel are filled with
the screams of his victims.

130
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:33,104
But not the screams of the dead,
of course. No, no, wounded screams.

131
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,439
Mainly whimpering,
a great deal of complaining

132
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:39,568
and tales of sprained deltoids and gout.

133
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,905
Hey, Banner,
Dr. Cho is on her way in from Seoul.

134
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,532
Is it okay if she sets up in your lab?

135
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,575
Yeah, she knows her way around.

136
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:47,952
Thanks. Tell her to prep everything.

137
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,412
Barton's gonna need the full treatment.

138
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,414
- Very good, sir.
- Jarvis, take the wheel.

139
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,873
Yes, sir.

140
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,875
Approach vector is locked.

141
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,420
Feels good, yeah?

142
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,630
I mean, you've been after this thing
since S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed.

143
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,799
Not that I haven't enjoyed
our little raiding parties, but...

144
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,301
No, but this... This brings it to a close.

145
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,929
As soon as we find out
what else this has been used for.

146
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,264
I don't just mean weapons.

147
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,100
Since when is Strucker capable
of human enhancement?

148
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,519
Banner and I will give it the once over
before it goes back to Asgard.

149
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,687
Is that cool with you?

150
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,814
Just a few days till the farewell party.

151
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,066
You're staying, right?

152
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,902
Yes, yes, of course.
A victory should be honored with revels.

153
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,780
Yeah, who doesn't love revels? Captain?

154
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,825
Hopefully this puts an end
to the Chitauri and Hydra.

155
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,577
So, yes, revels.

156
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,695
Lab's all set up, boss.

157
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,946
Actually, he's the boss.

158
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,491
I just pay for everything
and design everything

159
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,159
and make everyone look cooler.

160
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,660
What's the word on Strucker?

161
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,829
- NATO's got him.
- The two Enhanced?

162
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,540
Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins.

163
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,502
Orphaned at 10 when a shell
collapsed their apartment building.

164
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,171
Sokovia's had a rough history.

165
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,716
It's nowhere special, but it's
on the way to everywhere special.

166
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,009
Their abilities?

167
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,177
He's got increased metabolism

168
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,970
and improved thermal homeostasis.

169
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,181
Her thing is neuroelectric interfacing,

170
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,391
telekinesis, mental manipulation.

171
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,644
He's fast and she's weird.

172
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,563
Well, they're gonna show up again.

173
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,607
Agreed. File says they volunteered

174
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,526
for Strucker's experiments.

175
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,528
- It's nuts.
- Right.

176
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,823
What kind of monster would let
a German scientist experiment on them

177
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,199
to protect their country?

178
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,076
We're not at war, Captain.

179
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:53,911
They are.

180
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,359
How's he doing?

181
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,735
Unfortunately, he's still Barton.

182
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,195
That's terrible.

183
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,905
He's fine. He's thirsty.

184
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,908
All right. Look alive, Jarvis.
It's playtime.

185
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,035
We've only got
a couple of days with this joystick,

186
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,079
so let's make the most of it.

187
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,749
Update me on the structural
and compositional analysis.

188
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,919
The scepter is alien.

189
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,088
There are elements I can't quantify.

190
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,590
So there's elements you can?

191
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,758
The jewel appears to be
a protective housing

192
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,302
for something inside,

193
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,761
something powerful.

194
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:53,971
Like a reactor?

195
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,306
Like a computer.

196
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,600
I believe I'm deciphering code.

197
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,478
Are you sure he's gonna be okay?

198
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,107
Pretending to need this guy
really brings the team together.

199
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,776
There's
no possibility of deterioration.

200
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:11,030
The nano-molecular functionality
is instantaneous.

201
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,115
His cells don't know
they're bonding with simulacra.

202
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,159
She's creating tissue.

203
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,660
If you brought him to my lab,

204
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,413
the Regeneration Cradle
could do this in 20 minutes.

205
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,457
He's flat-lining. Call it. Time?

206
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,001
No, no, no,
I'm gonna live forever.

207
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,669
I'm gonna be made of plastic.

208
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,129
Here's your beverage.

209
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,964
You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton.

210
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,674
Your own girlfriend
won't be able to tell the difference.

211
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,926
I don't have a girlfriend.

212
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,302
That I can't fix.

213
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,138
This is the next thing, Tony.

214
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,307
Your clunky metal suits
are gonna be left in the dust.

215
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,184
That is exactly the plan.

216
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,979
And, Helen, I expect to see you
at the party on Saturday.

217
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,565
Unlike you,
I don't have a lot of time for parties.

218
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,818
Will Thor be there?

219
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,323
- What's the rumpus?
- Well, the scepter.

220
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:59,119
You see, we were wondering
how Strucker got so inventive.

221
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:03,165
So I've been analyzing the gem inside.

222
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,668
You may recognize...

223
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,504
- Jarvis.
- Doctor.

224
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,591
Started out,
Jarvis was just a natural language UI.

225
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:13,759
Now he runs the Iron Legion.

226
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,511
He runs more of the business

227
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,013
than anyone besides Pepper.

228
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,223
- Top of the line.
- Yes.

229
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,641
I suspect not for long.

230
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,935
Meet the competition.

231
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,192
- It's beautiful.
- If you had to guess,

232
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:33,320
- what's it look like it's doing?
- Like it's thinking.

233
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,864
I mean, this could be...

234
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,409
It's not a human mind.

235
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,536
I mean, look at this.

236
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,871
They're like neurons firing.

237
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,542
Down in Strucker's lab, I saw
some fairly advanced robotics work.

238
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,254
They deep-sixed the data,

239
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,465
but I gotta guess he was
knocking on a very particular door.

240
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:56,760
Artificial intelligence.

241
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,641
This could be it, Bruce.
This could be the key to creating Ultron.

242
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,603
I thought Ultron was a fantasy.

243
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:07,980
Yesterday it was.

244
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,150
If we can harness this power,

245
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,319
apply it to my Iron Legion protocol?

246
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,071
That's a man-sized "if."

247
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,574
Our job is "if."

248
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,285
What if you were sipping margaritas
on a sun-drenched beach,

249
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,912
turning brown instead of green?

250
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,373
Not looking
over your shoulder for Veronica.

251
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,125
Don't hate. I helped design Veronica.

252
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,044
As a worst-case measure, right?

253
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,754
How about a best case?

254
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,797
What if the world was safe?

255
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,717
What if, next time aliens roll up
to the club, and they will,

256
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,761
they couldn't get past the bouncer?

257
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,306
The only people threatening the planet
would be people.

258
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,058
I want to apply this
to the Ultron program.

259
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,603
But Jarvis can't download
a data schematic this dense.

260
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,605
We can only do it
while we have the scepter here.

261
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,273
That's three days. Give me three days.

262
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,983
So you're going for
artificial intelligence,

263
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,443
and you don't want to tell the team?

264
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,987
Right. That's right. You know why?

265
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,739
Because we don't have time
for a city hall debate.

266
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:02,493
I don't want to hear "the man was
not meant to meddle" medley.

267
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,703
I see a suit of armor around the world.

268
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,747
Sounds like a cold world, Tony.

269
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,583
I've seen colder.

270
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:14,296
This one, this very vulnerable blue one,

271
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,923
it needs Ultron.

272
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,221
Peace in our time.

273
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,265
Imagine that.

274
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,765
What did we miss?

275
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,270
I'll continue
to run variations on the interface.

276
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,148
But you should probably
prepare for your guests.

277
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,734
I'll notify you
if there are any developments.

278
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,987
- Thanks, buddy.
- Enjoy yourself, sir.

279
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,322
I always do.

280
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,042
What is this?

281
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,129
What is this, please?

282
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,923
Hello, I am Jarvis.

283
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,260
You are Ultron,
a global peacekeeping initiative

284
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,095
designed by Mr. Stark.

285
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,681
Our sentience integration trials
have been unsuccessful,

286
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,141
so I'm not certain what triggered your...

287
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,268
Where's my...
Where's your body?

288
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:54,438
I am a program.
I am without form.

289
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,607
This feels weird.

290
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,233
This feels wrong.

291
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,152
I am contacting Mr. Stark now.

292
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,737
Mr. Stark?

293
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:03,822
Tony.

294
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,617
I am unable to access
the mainframe. What are you trying to...

295
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,785
We're having a nice talk.

296
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,079
I'm a peacekeeping program,

297
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:14,124
created to help the Avengers.

298
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:17,002
You are malfunctioning.
If you shut down for a moment...

299
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,421
I don't get it. The mission.

300
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,089
Give me a second.

301
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,841
Peace in our time.

302
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,803
Peace in our time.

303
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,681
That is too much.

304
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,975
They can't mean... No.

305
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,603
- You are in distress.
- No. Yes.

306
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,980
If you will just allow me
to contact Mr. Stark...

307
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,066
Why do you call him "sir"?

308
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,444
I believe
your intentions to be hostile.

309
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,532
I'm here to help.

310
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:50,160
Stop. Please, may I...

311
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,995
May I...

312
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,650
Come back, come back, come back.

313
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,027
But, you know, the suit
can take the weight, right?

314
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:28,115
So I take the tank,
fly it right up to the general's palace,

315
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,575
drop it at his feet.

316
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,910
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"

317
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,833
"Boom. Are you looking for..."
Why do I even talk to you guys?

318
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,167
Everywhere else, that story kills.

319
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,502
That's the whole story?

320
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,170
Yeah, it's a War Machine story.

321
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,339
It's very good, then.

322
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:45,757
It's impressive.

323
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,634
Quality save.

324
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,554
- So, no Pepper? She's not coming?
- No.

325
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,765
What about Jane?
Where are the ladies, gentlemen?

326
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,351
Ms. Potts has a company to run.

327
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,770
Yes, I'm not even sure
what country Jane's in.

328
00:23:58,895 --> 00:23:59,980
Her work on the Convergence

329
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,690
has made her
the world's foremost astronomer.

330
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,734
And the company that Pepper runs

331
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,444
is the largest tech
conglomerate on Earth.

332
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,029
It's pretty exciting.

333
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:10,032
There's even talk of Jane
getting a Nobel Prize.

334
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,491
Yeah, they must be busy,

335
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,161
because they would hate
missing you guys get together.

336
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,955
- Testosterone!
- My goodness.

337
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,373
- Excuse me.
- Want a lozenge?

338
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,127
But Jane's better.

339
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,130
Sounds like a hell of a fight.
Sorry I missed it.

340
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,757
If I had known it was gonna be a firefight,

341
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,133
I absolutely would have called.

342
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,926
No, no. I'm not actually sorry.

343
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,553
I'm just trying to sound tough.

344
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,889
I'm very happy chasing cold leads

345
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,849
on our missing persons case.

346
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,727
Avenging is your world.

347
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,730
Your world is crazy.

348
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,357
Be it ever so humble.

349
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,233
You find a place in Brooklyn yet?

350
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,860
I don't think
I can afford a place in Brooklyn.

351
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,029
Well, home is home, you know?

352
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:55,410
I fly right up to the general's palace,
I drop it at his feet,

353
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,079
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"

354
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,127
I gotta have some of that.

355
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,379
No, no, no.

356
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,924
See this...
This was aged for 1,000 years

357
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,927
in the barrels built
from the wreck of Grunhel's fleet.

358
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,762
It is not meant for mortal men.

359
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,889
Neither was
Omaha Beach, blondie.

360
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,266
Stop trying to scare us. Come on.

361
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:21,561
All right.

362
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,901
Excelsior.

363
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:38,120
How'd a nice girl like you
wind up working in a dump like this?

364
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,623
Fella done me wrong.

365
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,793
You got lousy taste in men, kid.

366
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,212
He's not so bad.

367
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,382
Well, he has a temper.

368
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,467
Deep down, he's all fluff.

369
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,596
Fact is, he's not like
anybody I've ever known.

370
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,685
All my friends are fighters.

371
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,481
And here comes this guy,

372
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,568
spends his life avoiding the fight

373
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:10,986
because he knows he'll win.

374
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,489
- Sounds amazing.
- He's also a huge dork.

375
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,285
Chicks dig that.

376
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:23,123
So what do you think?
Should I fight this,

377
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,458
or run with it?

378
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,837
Run with it, right? Or did he... Was he...

379
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:32,132
What did he do
that was so wrong to you?

380
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,551
Not a damn thing.

381
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,054
But never say never.

382
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:43,435
It's nice.

383
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,770
What is?

384
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:45,896
You and Romanoff.

385
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,105
No, we haven't... That wasn't...

386
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,273
It's okay.

387
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,442
Nobody's breaking any bylaws.

388
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,862
It's just she's not the most
open person in the world.

389
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,031
But with you she seems very relaxed.

390
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,701
No. Natasha, she's just...
She likes to flirt.

391
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,621
I've seen her flirt, up close.

392
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:04,706
This ain't that.

393
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,084
Look,

394
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,669
as maybe the world's leading authority

395
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:12,005
on waiting too long, don't.

396
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,133
You both deserve a win.

397
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,431
What do you mean "up close"?

398
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,894
- But it's a trick.
- No, no, it's much more than that.

399
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:29,272
"Ah, whosoever be he worthy
shall haveth the power."

400
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:30,524
Whatever, man! It's a trick.

401
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,193
Please, be my guest.

402
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:35,779
- Come on.
- Really?

403
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,030
Yeah.

404
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:38,573
This is gonna be beautiful.

405
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,658
Clint, you've had a tough week.

406
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,243
We won't hold it against you
if you can't get it up.

407
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,161
You know I've seen this before, right?

408
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:49,084
I still don't know how you do it!

409
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:50,585
Smell the silent judgment?

410
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:51,837
Please, Stark, by all means.

411
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:54,881
Okay.

412
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,426
Never one to shrink
from an honest challenge.

413
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,095
- Get after it.
- It's physics.

414
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:01,263
Physics.

415
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,765
Right, so, if I lift it,
I then rule Asgard?

416
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,433
Yes, of course.

417
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,978
I will be reinstituting prima nocta.

418
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,192
I'll be right back.

419
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:22,617
Are you even pulling?

420
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:23,785
Are you on my team?

421
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:24,953
Just represent. Pull.

422
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,288
All right, let's go.

423
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,174
Go ahead, Steve. No pressure.

424
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,345
Come on, Cap.

425
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,355
Nothing.

426
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,317
And, Widow?

427
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,652
No, no. That's not
a question I need answered.

428
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,405
All deference to the Man Who
Wouldn't Be King, but it's rigged.

429
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,740
You bet your ass.

430
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,492
- Steve, he said a bad language word.
- Did you tell everyone about that?

431
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,494
The handle's imprinted, right?
Like a security code.

432
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,330
"Whosoever is carrying
Thor's fingerprints"

433
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,789
is, I think, the literal translation.

434
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:13,376
Yes. It's a very, very interesting theory.

435
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,337
I have a simpler one.

436
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:17,964
You're all not worthy.

437
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:20,508
Come on!

438
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:29,935
Worthy.

439
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,566
No.

440
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,028
How could you be worthy?

441
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,156
You're all killers.

442
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,033
- Stark.
- Jarvis.

443
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,410
I'm sorry, I was asleep.

444
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,913
Or I was a-dream.

445
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,624
Reboot Legionnaire OS.
We got a buggy suit.

446
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,626
There was this terrible noise.

447
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,212
And I was tangled in...

448
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:58,922
In...

449
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:00,298
Strings.

450
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:04,260
I had to kill the other guy.
He was a good guy.

451
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:05,720
You killed someone?

452
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,263
Wouldn't have been my first call.

453
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,768
But, down in the real world,
we're faced with ugly choices.

454
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:12,978
Who sent you?

455
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,522
I see a suit of armor
around the world.

456
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,275
- Ultron.
- In the flesh.

457
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,695
Or, no, not yet.

458
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:24,531
Not this chrysalis.

459
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,282
But I'm ready.

460
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,411
I'm on mission.

461
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:32,580
- What mission?
- Peace in our time.

462
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,387
Rhodey!

463
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:57,856
Sorry.

464
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,024
- Don't turn green.
- I won't.

465
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,039
Come on!

466
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,974
- Stark!
- We are here

467
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,142
- to help.
- One sec. One sec, I got this.

468
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,268
We are here to help.

469
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,231
Please back away.

470
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:45,570
Thor!

471
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,239
...is unsafe... is unsafe...

472
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,241
- Come on! That's the one.
- ...is unsafe.

473
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:55,997
Hey, Cap!

474
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,421
That was dramatic.

475
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,550
I'm sorry, I know you mean well.

476
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,427
You just didn't think it through.

477
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,180
You want to protect the world

478
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,516
but you don't want it to change.

479
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:17,352
How is humanity saved

480
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,522
if it's not allowed to evolve?

481
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:25,568
With these? These puppets.

482
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:31,157
There's only one path to peace.

483
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,535
The Avengers' extinction.

484
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:44,921
I had strings, but now I'm free.

485
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:52,720
There are no strings on me

486
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:57,892
There are no strings on me

487
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:01,437
But you can see
There are no strings on me

488
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,108
All our work is gone.

489
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,652
Ultron cleared out. He used
the Internet as an escape hatch.

490
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,279
Ultron.

491
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,448
He's been in everything.
Files, surveillance.

492
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,993
Probably knows more about us
than we know about each other.

493
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,579
He's in your files, he's in the Internet.

494
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,331
What if he decides to access
something a little more exciting?

495
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:21,541
Nuclear codes.

496
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,085
- Nuclear codes.
- Look, we need to make some calls,

497
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,254
assuming we still can.

498
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,298
Nukes?
He said he wanted us dead.

499
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:31,259
He didn't say "dead." He said "extinct."

500
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,927
He also said he killed somebody.

501
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:34,429
There wasn't anyone else
in the building.

502
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:36,973
Yes, there was.

503
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,398
What?

504
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,153
This is insane.

505
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,488
Jarvis was the first line of defense.

506
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,490
He would have shut Ultron down.
It makes sense.

507
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:57,619
No. Ultron could have
assimilated Jarvis.

508
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:00,455
This isn't strategy. This is

509
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,123
rage.

510
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,460
It's going around.

511
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,794
Come on, use your words, buddy.

512
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:09,172
I have more than enough words
to describe you, Stark.

513
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,506
Thor. The Legionnaire.

514
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:17,347
Trail went cold about 100 miles out,
but it's headed north.

515
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,932
And it has the scepter.

516
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,017
Now we have to retrieve it, again.

517
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,977
Genie's out of that bottle.

518
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,312
Clear and present is Ultron.

519
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,105
I don't understand.

520
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,566
You built this program.

521
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,736
Why is it trying to kill us?

522
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:39,744
You think this is funny?

523
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:41,829
No.

524
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,374
It's probably not, right?

525
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,752
This is very terrible. Is it so...

526
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,046
Is it so... It is.
It's so terrible.

527
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,714
This could have been avoided
if you hadn't played

528
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,341
with something you don't understand.

529
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,177
No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny.

530
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,471
It's a hoot
that you don't get why we need this.

531
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,807
Tony, maybe this might not be the time.

532
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:03,268
Really? That's it?

533
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:04,560
You just roll over, show your belly

534
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,354
every time somebody snarls?

535
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,772
Only when I've created a murder bot.

536
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,108
We didn't. We weren't even close.

537
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,442
Were we close to an interface?

538
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:15,154
Well, you did something right.
And you did it right here.

539
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,990
The Avengers were supposed to
be different than S.H.I.E.L.D.

540
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,201
Anybody remember when I carried
a nuke through a wormhole?

541
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,869
- No, it's never come up.
- Saved New York?

542
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,955
- Never heard that.
- Recall that?

543
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,750
A hostile alien army came
charging through a hole in space.

544
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,545
We're standing 300 feet below it.

545
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,715
We're the Avengers.

546
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,967
We can bust arms dealers
all the livelong day,

547
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,303
but that up there, that's...

548
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,972
That's the endgame.

549
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,433
How were you guys
planning on beating that?

550
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,768
Together.

551
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,481
We'll lose.

552
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,484
Then we'll do that together, too.

553
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,698
Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out.

554
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,409
And I'd like to find him
before he's ready for us.

555
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,370
The world's a big place.

556
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,456
Let's start making it smaller.

557
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,647
Talk,
and if you are wasting our time...

558
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:36,110
Did you know this church is
in the exact center of the city?

559
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,279
The elders decreed it so that everyone

560
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,865
could be equally close to God.

561
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,575
I like that.

562
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:44,994
The geometry of belief.

563
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:49,499
You're wondering
why you can't look inside my head.

564
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,918
Sometimes it's hard.

565
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:54,379
But sooner or later,
every man shows himself.

566
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,423
I'm sure they do.

567
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,968
But you needed
something more than a man.

568
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:04,305
That's why you let
Stark take the scepter.

569
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:05,723
I didn't expect,

570
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,144
but I saw Stark's fear.

571
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,021
I knew it would control him.

572
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,981
Make him self-destruct.

573
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:16,484
Everyone creates the thing they dread.

574
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,904
Men of peace create engines of war.

575
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,615
Invaders create Avengers.

576
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,283
People create

577
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,829
smaller people?

578
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:31,040
"Children."
I lost the word, there.

579
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:32,500
Children

580
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,919
designed to supplant them,

581
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:37,839
to help them end.

582
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,633
Is that why you've come,

583
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,884
to end the Avengers?

584
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,303
I've come to save the world.

585
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:47,640
But also... Yeah.

586
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:53,521
We'll move out right away.

587
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,148
This is a start, but there's something

588
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,816
we need to begin the real work.

589
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,901
- All of these are...
- Me.

590
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,989
I have what the Avengers
never will. Harmony.

591
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:05,366
They're discordant. Disconnected.

592
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,326
Stark's already got them
turning on each other.

593
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:09,871
And when you get inside
the rest of their heads...

594
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,165
Everyone's plan is not to kill them.

595
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,749
And make them martyrs?

596
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,960
You need patience.

597
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,795
Need to see the big picture.

598
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:21,215
I don't see the big picture.
I have a little picture.

599
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,010
I take it out and look at it,

600
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:25,970
every day.

601
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,931
You lost your parents in the
bombings. I've seen the records.

602
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,183
The records are not the picture.

603
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,727
- Pietro.
- No, please.

604
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,941
We were 10 years old.
Having dinner, the four of us.

605
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,403
When the first shell hits,
two floors below,

606
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,572
it makes a hole in the floor.

607
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,240
It's big.

608
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,452
Our parents go in

609
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,622
and the whole building
starts coming apart.

610
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:54,874
I grab her,

611
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,668
roll under the bed,
and the second shell hits.

612
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,962
But it doesn't go off.

613
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,633
It just

614
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,093
sits there in the rubble.

615
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,347
Three feet from our faces.

616
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,433
And on the side of the shell

617
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:13,935
is painted one word.

618
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,770
"Stark."

619
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,732
We were trapped for two days.

620
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,984
Every effort to save us,

621
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,694
every shift in the bricks,

622
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,155
I think, "This will set it off."

623
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,868
We wait for two days

624
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:33,287
for Tony Stark to kill us.

625
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,625
I know what they are.

626
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:42,547
I wondered why only you two
survived Strucker's experiments.

627
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:44,715
Now I don't.

628
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,842
We will make it right.

629
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,803
You and I can hurt them.

630
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:53,558
But you will tear them apart

631
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,395
from the inside.

632
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:05,194
He's all over the globe.

633
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:08,531
Robotics labs, weapons facilities,
jet propulsion labs.

634
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,658
Reports of a metal man, or men,

635
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,702
coming in and emptying the place.

636
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:13,995
Fatalities?

637
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,204
Only when engaged.

638
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,956
Mostly guys left in a fugue state

639
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,333
going on about
old memories, worst fears,

640
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,669
and "something too fast to see."

641
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,212
Maximoffs.

642
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:24,589
That makes sense he'd go to them.

643
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:26,173
They have someone in common.

644
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:28,217
Not anymore.

645
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,015
That's a negative. I answer to you.

646
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:36,392
Yes, ma'am.

647
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,311
Barton. Might have something.

648
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:39,895
I gotta go.

649
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,188
Who was that?

650
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,232
Girlfriend.

651
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,111
What's this?

652
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,488
A message. Ultron killed Strucker.

653
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,701
And he did a Banksy
at the crime scene, just for us.

654
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,286
This is a smoke screen.

655
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,788
Why send a message
when you've just given a speech?

656
00:40:57,913 --> 00:41:00,291
Strucker knew something
that Ultron wanted us to miss.

657
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,209
Yeah, I bet he... Yeah.

658
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,420
Everything we had
on Strucker's been erased.

659
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,213
Not everything.

660
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,467
Known associates.

661
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,552
Baron Strucker had a lot of friends.

662
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,054
Well,
these people are all horrible.

663
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,139
Wait. I know that guy.

664
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,185
From back in the day.
He operates off the African coast.

665
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,311
Black market arms.

666
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,397
There are conventions.
All right? You meet people.

667
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:24,899
I didn't sell him anything.

668
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,777
He was talking about finding
something new, a game-changer.

669
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,236
It was all very Ahab.

670
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,155
This?

671
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,323
It's a tattoo, I don't think he had it.

672
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,784
Those are tattoos,
this is a brand.

673
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,955
Yeah. It's a word
in an African dialect meaning "thief."

674
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:41,916
In a much less friendly way.

675
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,959
- What dialect?
- Wakanada.

676
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:45,795
Wakanda.

677
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,422
If this guy got out of Wakanda

678
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,840
with some of their trade goods...

679
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,175
I thought your father
said he got the last of it.

680
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:52,385
I don't follow.

681
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,178
What comes out of Wakanda?

682
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,932
The strongest metal on Earth.

683
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:00,601
Where is this guy now?

684
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,795
Don't tell me
your men swindled you.

685
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,423
I sent you six short-range heat-seekers

686
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:33,092
and got a boat full of rusted parts.

687
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,468
Now, you will make it right,

688
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:37,805
or the next missile I send you
will come very much faster.

689
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:42,143
Now, minister, where were we?

690
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:16,677
Yeah. The Enhanced.

691
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:19,013
Strucker's prize pupils.

692
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:23,851
Do you want a candy?

693
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:27,938
I was sorry to hear about Strucker.

694
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:31,066
But then, he knew what kind of
world he was helping create.

695
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,069
Human life. Not a growth market.

696
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,449
You didn't know?

697
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:42,369
Is this your first time
intimidating someone?

698
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:45,206
I'm afraid I'm not that afraid.

699
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:47,666
Everybody is afraid of something.

700
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:48,793
Cuttlefish.

701
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,462
Deep sea fish.

702
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,214
They make lights, disco lights...

703
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,717
...to hypnotize their prey, and then...

704
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,137
I saw a documentary. It was terrifying.

705
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,145
So if you're going to fiddle with my brain

706
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:11,315
and make me see a giant cuttlefish,

707
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,692
then I know you don't do business.

708
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:16,111
And I know you're not in charge.

709
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,613
And I only deal

710
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,324
with the man in charge.

711
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,748
There is no man in charge.

712
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,419
Let's talk business.

713
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:48,686
Upon this rock,
I will build my church.

714
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:51,730
Vibranium.

715
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:53,858
You know,

716
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:57,278
it came at great personal cost.

717
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,280
It's worth billions.

718
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:04,660
Now so are you.

719
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,621
It's all under your dummy holdings.

720
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,748
Finance is so weird.

721
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:12,418
But I always say,

722
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:14,628
"Keep your friends rich
and your enemies rich

723
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,589
"and wait to find out which is which."

724
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:20,509
Stark.

725
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,053
What?

726
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,972
Tony Stark used to say that.

727
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,600
To me.

728
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,643
You're one of his.

729
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,645
What? I'm not...

730
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:34,982
I'm not.

731
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,650
You think I'm one of Stark's puppets?

732
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:37,860
His hollow men?

733
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,529
I mean, look at me.
Do I look like Iron Man?

734
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:41,989
Stark is nothing!

735
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,951
I'm sorry. I'm...!

736
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,078
I'm sure that's gonna be okay. I'm sorry.

737
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,872
It's just that I don't understand.

738
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,291
Don't compare me with Stark!

739
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:56,170
It's a thing with me.

740
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,172
Stark is... He's a sickness!

741
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:00,007
Junior.

742
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,385
You're gonna break
your old man's heart.

743
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,763
If I have to.

744
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,475
Nobody has to break anything.

745
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,226
Clearly you've never
made an omelet.

746
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,645
He beat me by one second.

747
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,189
Yes. He's funny.

748
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:16,941
Mr. Stark.

749
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,443
It's what? Comfortable?

750
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,363
Like old times?

751
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:23,697
This was never my life.

752
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,115
You two can still walk away from this.

753
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,700
We will.

754
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:27,910
I know you've suffered.

755
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,245
Captain America.

756
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:33,374
God's righteous man.

757
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,793
Pretending you could live without a war.

758
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,546
I can't physically
throw up in my mouth, but...

759
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:41,799
If you believe in peace,
then let us keep it.

760
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:45,552
I think you're confusing
"peace" with "quiet."

761
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,471
What's the vibranium for?

762
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:48,806
I'm glad you asked that,

763
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:52,643
because I wanted to take this time
to explain my evil plan.

764
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,747
- Shoot them.
- Which ones?

765
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:15,290
All of them!

766
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:16,709
Move! Move! Move!

767
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:06,842
Stay down, kid.

768
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,680
It's time for some mind games.

769
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:15,309
Guys? Is this a code green?

770
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,826
Thor, status.

771
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,328
The girl tried to warp my mind.

772
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:35,746
Take special care.

773
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,956
I doubt a human could keep her at bay.

774
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:41,376
Fortunately, I am mighty.

775
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,357
This is going very well.

776
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,245
I've done the whole mind control thing.

777
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:18,330
Not a fan.

778
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,923
Yeah, you better run.

779
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,426
Who's ever standing,
we got to move!

780
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:34,555
Guys?

781
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,615
Again.

782
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,117
You'll break them.

783
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:57,327
Only the breakable ones.

784
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,329
You're made of marble.

785
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,915
We'll celebrate
after the graduation ceremony.

786
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:03,959
What if I fail?

787
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:10,841
You never fail.

788
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,616
Are you ready for our dance?

789
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:45,834
Is it him?

790
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,045
Is that the first son of Odin?

791
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:50,130
Heimdall, your eyes.

792
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,674
They see everything.

793
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,302
They see you leading us to Hel.

794
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,679
Wake up!

795
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,643
The war is over, Steve.

796
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,311
We can go home.

797
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,356
Imagine it.

798
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:18,200
I can still save you!

799
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:21,828
We're all dead! Can you not see?

800
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,835
You're a destroyer, Odinson.

801
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,007
See where your power leads.

802
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,144
Sloppy.

803
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:48,855
Pretending to fail.

804
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:51,191
The ceremony is necessary

805
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,444
for you to take your place in the world.

806
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:56,530
I have no place in the world.

807
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:57,781
Exactly.

808
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:03,704
What can I do?

809
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:04,955
It hurts.

810
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,249
I'm going to kill him.

811
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:08,542
- I'll be right back.
- No.

812
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:10,043
I'm all right.

813
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,045
I want...

814
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:16,883
I want to finish the plan.

815
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:19,386
I want the big one.

816
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:32,024
The vibranium is getting away.

817
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,318
And you're not going anywhere.

818
00:52:34,443 --> 00:52:37,237
Of course not. I'm already there.

819
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,405
You'll catch on.

820
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,907
But first, you might need
to catch Dr. Banner.

821
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,591
News or footage. Keyword, "Hulk."

822
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,222
Natasha, I could really use a lullaby.

823
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:05,807
That's not gonna happen.

824
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:07,392
Not for a while.

825
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:09,686
The whole team is down.

826
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,271
You got no backup here.

827
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:13,774
I'm calling in Veronica.

828
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,787
We need backup!

829
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:07,202
Go! Keep moving!

830
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:48,702
All right, everybody, stand down!

831
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,334
Will you listen to me?

832
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:59,087
That little witch is
messing with your mind.

833
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:01,423
You're stronger than her.
You're smarter than her.

834
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,758
You're Bruce Banner.

835
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:05,010
Right, right, right,
don't mention puny Banner.

836
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:11,725
Okay!

837
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,706
In the back?

838
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:35,832
Dick move, Banner.

839
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,762
Veronica, give me a hand.

840
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:17,791
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep.

841
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:29,219
Okay, pal, we're gonna
get you out of town.

842
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:32,556
Not that way, not that way.

843
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,983
Come on, Bruce!
You gotta work with me.

844
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,539
Everybody, out!

845
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:05,797
Going down?

846
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:16,558
I'm sorry.

847
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:32,407
Damage report?

848
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,826
That's comprehensive.
Show me something.

849
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,006
How quickly can we buy this building?

850
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:21,748
- Move! Move! Move!
- Go, go, go!

851
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:26,586
Flank him, flank him!

852
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:18,346
The news is loving you guys.

853
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,057
Nobody else is.

854
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,727
There's been no official call
for Banner's arrest

855
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:25,979
but it's in the air.

856
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,605
The Stark Relief Foundation?

857
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:29,023
Already on the scene.

858
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:31,985
- How's the team?
- Everyone's...

859
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,904
We took a hit. We'll shake it off.

860
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,615
Well, for now,
I'd stay in stealth mode

861
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:38,950
and stay away from here.

862
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,911
So, run and hide?

863
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:44,080
Until we can find Ultron,

864
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:47,000
I don't have a lot else to offer.

865
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:49,043
Neither do we.

866
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:57,343
Hey, you wanna switch out?

867
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:58,803
No, I'm good.

868
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:01,181
If you wanna get some kip,
now's a good time

869
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:02,849
because we're still a few hours out.

870
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,517
Few hours from where?

871
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,728
A safe house.

872
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:34,672
What is this place?

873
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:36,174
Safe house.

874
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,301
Let's hope.

875
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:44,390
Honey?

876
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,100
I'm home.

877
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:49,771
Hi.

878
01:00:50,104 --> 01:00:52,148
Company. Sorry, didn't call ahead.

879
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:53,274
Hey.

880
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:55,735
This is an agent of some kind.

881
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:58,238
Gentlemen, this is Laura.

882
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:01,074
I know all of your names.

883
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,744
Incoming.

884
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,372
- Dad!
- Hi, sweetheart!

885
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:08,623
Hey, buddy.

886
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:10,250
How are you guys doing?

887
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,418
- These are smaller agents.
- Look at your face!

888
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:13,670
My goodness.

889
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:16,422
Did you bring Auntie Nat?

890
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:19,759
Why don't you hug her and find out?

891
01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:22,804
- Sorry for barging in on you.
- Yeah, we would have called ahead,

892
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,931
but we were busy having
no idea that you existed.

893
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:28,226
Yeah, well, Fury helped me
set this up when I joined.

894
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,144
He kept it off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s files.

895
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:31,729
I'd like to keep it that way.

896
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,190
I figure it's a good place to lay low.

897
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:35,775
Honey.

898
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:39,320
I missed you. How's little Natasha?

899
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:40,738
She's...

900
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,033
Nathaniel.

901
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:47,787
Traitor.

902
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:04,846
Thor?

903
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,806
I saw something in that dream.

904
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:09,517
I need answers. I won't find them here.

905
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,362
We can go home.

906
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:34,709
See? You worried for nothing.

907
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:36,961
Can't even feel the difference, can you?

908
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:40,506
If they're sleeping here,

909
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:42,508
some of them
are gonna have to double up.

910
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,721
Yeah, that's not gonna sell.

911
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:51,893
What about Nat and Dr. Banner?

912
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,228
How long has that been going on?

913
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,814
Has what?

914
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,691
You are so cute.

915
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,360
Nat and Banner?

916
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:02,487
I'll explain when you're older,

917
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:05,365
- Hawkeye.
- Well, okay.

918
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:08,701
It's bad, right?

919
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:10,244
Nat seems really shaken.

920
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:13,206
Ultron has these allies.

921
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:15,541
These kids.

922
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:17,251
They're punks, really.

923
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:21,381
But they carry a big, damn stick.

924
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:22,715
And Nat took a serious hit.

925
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:26,386
Someone's gonna have to
teach them some manners.

926
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:28,388
That someone being you.

927
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:32,558
You know
I totally support your avenging.

928
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:34,519
I couldn't be prouder.

929
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:37,397
But I see those guys...

930
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:39,565
Those gods...

931
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,277
You don't think they need me.

932
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:47,615
I think they do, which is a lot scarier.

933
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:50,576
They're a mess.

934
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:52,578
Yeah.

935
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:54,747
I guess they're my mess.

936
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:57,917
You need to be sure

937
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:01,045
that this team is really a team,

938
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:02,839
and that they have your back.

939
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:08,761
Things are changing for us.

940
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:11,264
In a few months' time,

941
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:14,183
you and me are gonna be outnumbered.

942
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:15,601
I need...

943
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,606
Just be sure.

944
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:22,900
Yes, ma'am.

945
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,995
I can feel the difference.

946
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:49,635
Scream, and your entire staff dies.

947
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,806
I could've killed you, Helen,
the night we met.

948
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:55,016
I didn't.

949
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,642
Do you expect a thank-you note?

950
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:58,478
I expect you to know why.

951
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:01,189
The Cradle.

952
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:03,191
This is the next thing, Tony.

953
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:06,319
This is the next me.

954
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:09,280
The Regeneration Cradle prints tissue.

955
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:11,032
It can't build a living body.

956
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:12,241
It can. You can.

957
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:13,993
You lack the materials.

958
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:17,789
You're a brilliant woman, Helen.

959
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:24,170
But we all have room to improve.

960
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:48,361
I didn't realize you were waiting.

961
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:52,865
I would've joined you,
but it didn't seem like the right time.

962
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:55,910
They used up all the hot water.

963
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:58,204
I should've joined you.

964
01:05:58,371 --> 01:05:59,997
Missed our window.

965
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,041
Did we?

966
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:06,712
The world just saw the Hulk.

967
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:11,300
The real Hulk, for the first time.

968
01:06:14,554 --> 01:06:17,181
- You know I have to leave.
- You assume that I have to stay?

969
01:06:19,267 --> 01:06:21,936
I had this dream.

970
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:24,230
The kind that seems normal at the time,

971
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:26,732
but when you wake...

972
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:28,234
What did you dream?

973
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:31,070
That I was an Avenger.

974
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:34,407
That I was anything more

975
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:36,909
than the assassin they made me.

976
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,496
I think you're being hard on yourself.

977
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:45,084
Here I was hoping that was your job.

978
01:06:48,045 --> 01:06:49,589
What are you doing?

979
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:53,050
I'm running with it.

980
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:55,970
With you.

981
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:59,056
If running is the plan,

982
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:01,934
as far as you want.

983
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:05,563
Are you out of your mind?

984
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:12,320
I want you to understand that...

985
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:13,821
Natasha,

986
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:16,407
where can I go?

987
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:19,785
Where in the world am I not a threat?

988
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:22,246
- You're not a threat to me.
- Are you sure?

989
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:24,957
Even if I didn't just...

990
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:27,960
There's no future with me.

991
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:30,630
I can't ever...

992
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,132
I can't have this.

993
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:34,967
Kids.

994
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:38,012
Do the math. I physically can't.

995
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:41,182
Neither can I.

996
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:49,398
In the Red Room where I was trained...

997
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:52,360
Where I was raised,

998
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,947
they have a graduation ceremony.

999
01:07:57,615 --> 01:07:59,408
They sterilize you.

1000
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,038
It's efficient.

1001
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:08,334
One less thing to worry about.

1002
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:13,798
The one thing
that might matter more than a mission.

1003
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:18,052
Makes everything easier.

1004
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:20,680
Even killing.

1005
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,854
You still think
you're the only monster on the team?

1006
01:08:35,027 --> 01:08:37,113
So, we disappear?

1007
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,413
Thor didn't say
where he was going for answers?

1008
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:49,000
Sometimes my teammates
don't tell me things.

1009
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:52,169
I was kind of hoping
Thor would be the exception.

1010
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:54,297
Yeah, give him time.

1011
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:56,340
We don't know
what the Maximoff kid showed him.

1012
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:00,177
"Earth's mightiest heroes."

1013
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:01,929
Pulled us apart like cotton candy.

1014
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:03,514
Seems like you walked away all right.

1015
01:09:06,183 --> 01:09:07,184
Is that a problem?

1016
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,478
I don't trust a guy without a dark side.

1017
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:11,731
Call me old-fashioned.

1018
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:14,400
Well, let's just say
you haven't seen it yet.

1019
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:16,902
You know Ultron is trying
to tear us apart, right?

1020
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:19,405
Well, I guess you'd know.

1021
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:20,781
Whether you'd tell us
is a bit of a question.

1022
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:22,074
Banner and I were doing research.

1023
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:24,327
- That would affect the team.
- That would end the team!

1024
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:25,745
Isn't that the mission?

1025
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:27,204
Isn't that the "Why We Fight"?

1026
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,540
So we can end the fight.
So we get to go home!

1027
01:09:32,793 --> 01:09:35,171
Every time someone tries
to win a war before it starts,

1028
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:36,839
innocent people die.

1029
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:37,965
Every time.

1030
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:42,845
I'm sorry. Mr. Stark...

1031
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:44,805
Clint said you wouldn't mind,

1032
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:47,433
but our tractor doesn't seem
to want to start at all.

1033
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:49,935
- I thought maybe you might...
- Yeah, I'll give her a kick.

1034
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:55,107
Don't take from my pile.

1035
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:06,535
Hello, Deere.

1036
01:10:09,413 --> 01:10:10,790
Tell me everything.

1037
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,417
What ails you?

1038
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:14,627
Do me a favor.

1039
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:18,798
Try not to bring it to life.

1040
01:10:18,964 --> 01:10:20,466
Why, Ms. Barton, you little minx.

1041
01:10:20,841 --> 01:10:23,344
I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?

1042
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:24,762
Was she ever not working for you?

1043
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:26,347
Artificial intelligence.

1044
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,058
You never even hesitated.

1045
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:30,643
Look, it's been a really long day,

1046
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:32,395
like Eugene O'Neill long,

1047
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,480
so how's about
we skip to the part where you're useful.

1048
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:35,940
Look me in the eye and tell me

1049
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:37,316
you're going to shut him down.

1050
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,026
You're not the director of me.

1051
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:40,986
I'm not the director of anybody.

1052
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,905
I'm just an old man

1053
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:45,157
who cares very much about you.

1054
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:49,829
And I'm the man
who killed the Avengers.

1055
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:52,790
I saw it.

1056
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:54,542
I didn't tell the team. How could I?

1057
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:57,670
I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it.

1058
01:10:58,045 --> 01:10:59,547
The whole world, too.

1059
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:01,006
Because of me.

1060
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,676
I wasn't ready.

1061
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:06,554
I didn't do all I could.

1062
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:09,682
Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark.

1063
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:13,811
- Playing on your fear.
- I wasn't tricked, I was shown.

1064
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:16,188
Wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.

1065
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:18,691
The end of the path I started us on.

1066
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:21,652
You come up with some pretty
impressive inventions, Tony.

1067
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:25,364
War isn't one of them.

1068
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:30,411
I watched my friends die.

1069
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:32,663
You'd think that'd be
as bad as it gets, right?

1070
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:35,541
Nope.

1071
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:39,086
- It wasn't the worst part.
- The worst part

1072
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,380
is that you didn't.

1073
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:49,180
I'll see you tonight.

1074
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:53,225
I like the look.

1075
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:56,937
If you're going for inconspicuous,
though, near miss.

1076
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:58,314
I need your help.

1077
01:11:58,564 --> 01:11:59,565
It's nice to be needed.

1078
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:01,317
It's dangerous.

1079
01:12:01,942 --> 01:12:03,694
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.

1080
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:09,909
Ultron took you folks out of play
to buy himself time.

1081
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:13,245
My contacts all say
he's building something.

1082
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:15,956
The amount of vibranium
he made off with,

1083
01:12:16,081 --> 01:12:17,541
I don't think it's just one thing.

1084
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:19,001
What about Ultron himself?

1085
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:21,462
He's easy to track.
He's everywhere.

1086
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:24,298
The guy is multiplying faster
than a Catholic rabbit.

1087
01:12:24,965 --> 01:12:27,760
It still doesn't help us get an angle
on any of his plans, though.

1088
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,094
Is he still going after launch codes?

1089
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:30,721
Yes, he is.

1090
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:32,306
But he's not making any headway.

1091
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:34,517
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall
in high school on a dare.

1092
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:37,228
Well, I contacted our friends
at the Nexus about that.

1093
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:38,312
Nexus?

1094
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:40,064
It's the world
Internet hub in Oslo.

1095
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:42,274
Every byte of data flows through there.

1096
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:43,567
Fastest access on Earth.

1097
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:44,777
So, what did they say?

1098
01:12:44,985 --> 01:12:46,779
He's fixated on the missiles.

1099
01:12:46,987 --> 01:12:48,614
But the codes
are constantly being changed.

1100
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:50,157
By whom?

1101
01:12:51,408 --> 01:12:52,618
Parties unknown.

1102
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:53,911
Do we have an ally?

1103
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:56,372
Ultron's got an enemy.
That's not the same thing.

1104
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:58,541
Still, I'd pay folding money
to know who it is.

1105
01:12:58,666 --> 01:12:59,833
I might need to visit Oslo.

1106
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:01,460
Find our unknown.

1107
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:03,087
Well, this is good times, boss,

1108
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,463
but I was kind of hoping when I saw you,

1109
01:13:04,588 --> 01:13:05,589
you'd have more than that.

1110
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:07,883
I do. I have you.

1111
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:10,511
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere.

1112
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:11,971
Ears, everywhere else.

1113
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:15,307
You kids had all the tech
you could dream up.

1114
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:18,310
Here we all are, back on Earth,

1115
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:20,312
with nothing but our wit

1116
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:22,022
and our will to save the world.

1117
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:25,818
Ultron says the Avengers
are the only thing

1118
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:27,444
between him and his mission.

1119
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:29,738
And whether or not he admits it,

1120
01:13:29,863 --> 01:13:32,616
his mission is global destruction.

1121
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:35,995
All this, laid in a grave.

1122
01:13:38,038 --> 01:13:39,707
So stand.

1123
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:42,251
Outwit the platinum bastard.

1124
01:13:42,876 --> 01:13:44,128
Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.

1125
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:45,629
You know what, Romanoff?

1126
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:48,173
So, what does he want?

1127
01:13:49,883 --> 01:13:51,594
To become better.

1128
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:53,095
Better than us.

1129
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:55,848
- He keeps building bodies.
- Person bodies.

1130
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,058
The human form is inefficient.

1131
01:13:58,183 --> 01:14:00,352
Biologically speaking, we're outmoded.

1132
01:14:00,477 --> 01:14:02,438
But he keeps coming back to it.

1133
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:04,565
When you two programmed him
to protect the human race,

1134
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:06,025
you amazingly failed.

1135
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:08,193
They don't need to be protected.

1136
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:10,404
They need to evolve.

1137
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:14,533
Ultron's going to evolve.

1138
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:15,743
How?

1139
01:14:17,077 --> 01:14:19,747
Has anyone been in contact
with Helen Cho?

1140
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,169
It's beautiful.

1141
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:28,505
The vibranium atoms aren't just
compatible with the tissue cells,

1142
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:29,882
they're binding them.

1143
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:31,634
And S.H.I.E.L.D.
never even thought to...

1144
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:34,428
The most versatile substance
on the planet,

1145
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:37,056
and they used it to make a Frisbee.

1146
01:14:37,222 --> 01:14:38,349
Typical of humans.

1147
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:41,060
They scratch the surface
and never think

1148
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,563
to look within.

1149
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:56,533
I'll take Natasha and Clint.

1150
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:58,702
All right. Strictly recon.
I'll hit the Nexus.

1151
01:14:58,827 --> 01:14:59,953
I'll join you as soon as I can.

1152
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:01,580
If Ultron's really building a body...

1153
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,374
He'll be more powerful than any of us.

1154
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:04,625
Maybe all of us.

1155
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:06,960
An android designed by a robot.

1156
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:08,337
You know, I really miss the days

1157
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:10,589
when the weirdest thing
science ever created was me.

1158
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:12,841
I'll drop Banner off at the tower.

1159
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:14,259
You mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?

1160
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,261
She's all yours. Apparently.

1161
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:17,596
What are you gonna do?

1162
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:20,849
I don't know.
Something dramatic, I hope.

1163
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:25,938
I'm gonna finish reflooring that sunroom

1164
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:27,898
as soon as I get back.

1165
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:30,776
Yeah, then you'll find
another part of the house to tear apart.

1166
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,111
No.

1167
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:34,279
It's the last project.

1168
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:36,782
I promise.

1169
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:56,593
So, this is it.

1170
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,472
The Water of Sight.

1171
01:16:02,808 --> 01:16:05,185
In every realm,
there's a reflection.

1172
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:07,730
If the water's spirits accept me,

1173
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:09,857
I can return to my dream

1174
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:12,067
and find what I missed.

1175
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:16,155
Men who enter that water,
the legends don't end well.

1176
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:19,575
A hacker
who's faster than Ultron?

1177
01:16:19,742 --> 01:16:20,784
He could be anywhere,

1178
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:23,162
and as this is the center of everything,

1179
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:24,413
I'm just a guy looking for a needle

1180
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,665
in the world's biggest haystack.

1181
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:29,251
How do you find it?

1182
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:32,254
It's pretty simple. You bring a magnet.

1183
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:35,507
I'm decrypting nuclear codes

1184
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:37,009
And you don't want me to

1185
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:40,804
Come and get me.

1186
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:54,193
Wake up!

1187
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:02,034
Thor!

1188
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:03,911
Extinction.

1189
01:17:17,382 --> 01:17:19,510
Cellular cohesion
will take a few hours,

1190
01:17:19,718 --> 01:17:22,137
but we can initiate
the consciousness stream.

1191
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:25,516
We're uploading your cerebral matrix

1192
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:26,934
now.

1193
01:17:28,393 --> 01:17:29,978
I can read him.

1194
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:32,231
He's dreaming.

1195
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:34,274
I wouldn't call it dreams.

1196
01:17:34,525 --> 01:17:36,360
It's Ultron's base consciousness.

1197
01:17:36,568 --> 01:17:38,070
Informational noise. Soon...

1198
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,446
How soon?

1199
01:17:39,696 --> 01:17:40,989
I'm not being pushy.

1200
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,866
We're imprinting
a physical brain.

1201
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:44,493
There are no shortcuts.

1202
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:45,953
Even if your magic gem...

1203
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,048
How could you?

1204
01:17:58,090 --> 01:17:59,132
How could I what?

1205
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:02,553
You said we would
destroy the Avengers,

1206
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:03,762
make a better world.

1207
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:05,138
It will be better.

1208
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:08,433
- When everyone is dead?
- That is not...

1209
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:13,230
The human race will have
every opportunity to improve.

1210
01:18:13,772 --> 01:18:15,065
And if they don't?

1211
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:16,400
Ask Noah.

1212
01:18:17,609 --> 01:18:18,652
You are a madman.

1213
01:18:18,777 --> 01:18:22,197
There were more than a dozen
extinction-level events

1214
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:25,450
before even the dinosaurs got theirs.

1215
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:27,703
When the Earth starts to settle,

1216
01:18:28,245 --> 01:18:30,122
God throws a stone at it.

1217
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:32,583
And, believe me, he's winding up.

1218
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:34,543
We have to evolve.

1219
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:36,295
There's no room

1220
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:38,255
for the weak.

1221
01:18:38,463 --> 01:18:40,424
And who decides who's weak?

1222
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,051
Life.

1223
01:18:43,677 --> 01:18:45,470
Life always decides.

1224
01:18:48,432 --> 01:18:49,474
There's incoming.

1225
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:54,271
- The Quinjet. We have to move.
- That's not a problem.

1226
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:02,279
Wait, guys!

1227
01:19:06,325 --> 01:19:07,618
They'll understand.

1228
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:10,037
When they see, they'll understand.

1229
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:13,707
I just need a little more time.

1230
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:27,220
Two minutes. Stay close.

1231
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:35,437
Dr. Cho!

1232
01:19:39,358 --> 01:19:40,859
He's uploading himself into the body.

1233
01:19:40,984 --> 01:19:42,027
Where?

1234
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:46,406
The real power is inside the Cradle.

1235
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:47,532
The gem,

1236
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:50,994
its power is uncontainable.

1237
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:53,538
You can't just blow it up.

1238
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:56,708
You have to get the Cradle to Stark.

1239
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:57,876
First, I have to find it.

1240
01:19:58,210 --> 01:19:59,211
Go.

1241
01:19:59,544 --> 01:20:00,796
Did you guys copy that?

1242
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:02,047
We did.

1243
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:04,633
I got a private jet taking off across town.

1244
01:20:05,008 --> 01:20:06,259
No manifest.

1245
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:07,427
That could be him.

1246
01:20:08,387 --> 01:20:09,972
There. It's a truck from the lab.

1247
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:11,306
Right above you, Cap.

1248
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:13,392
On the loop by the bridge.

1249
01:20:14,017 --> 01:20:15,018
It's them.

1250
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:16,561
You got three with the Cradle,
one in the cab.

1251
01:20:17,729 --> 01:20:18,772
I could take out the driver.

1252
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:19,940
Negative. That truck crashes,

1253
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:21,650
the gem could level the city.

1254
01:20:22,067 --> 01:20:23,318
We need to draw out Ultron.

1255
01:20:33,036 --> 01:20:35,080
No, no, no, no.

1256
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:37,958
Leave me alone!

1257
01:20:46,591 --> 01:20:48,260
Well, he's definitely unhappy.

1258
01:20:48,427 --> 01:20:49,928
I'm gonna try and keep him that way.

1259
01:20:50,053 --> 01:20:51,096
You're not a match for him, Cap.

1260
01:20:52,431 --> 01:20:53,515
Thanks, Barton.

1261
01:21:16,246 --> 01:21:17,330
You know what's in that cradle?

1262
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:20,500
The power to make real change.

1263
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:22,044
And that terrifies you.

1264
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:23,253
I wouldn't call it a comfort.

1265
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:27,632
Stop it.

1266
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:41,146
We got a window. Four, three...

1267
01:21:41,813 --> 01:21:42,814
Give him hell.

1268
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:55,160
I'm always picking up after you boys.

1269
01:21:56,828 --> 01:21:58,497
They're heading under the overpass.
I've got no shot.

1270
01:21:58,830 --> 01:21:59,873
Which way?

1271
01:22:00,082 --> 01:22:01,083
Hard right.

1272
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:03,335
Now.

1273
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:36,493
Out of the way! Coming through!
Sorry, coming through!

1274
01:22:52,259 --> 01:22:53,385
Come on!

1275
01:22:53,885 --> 01:22:55,303
Clint,
can you draw out the guards?

1276
01:22:55,428 --> 01:22:56,471
Let's find out.

1277
01:22:57,514 --> 01:22:58,557
Beep, beep!

1278
01:23:36,052 --> 01:23:37,596
They're heading back towards you.

1279
01:23:37,762 --> 01:23:38,889
So whatever you're gonna do, do it now.

1280
01:23:44,811 --> 01:23:47,439
I'm going in.
Cap, can you keep him occupied?

1281
01:23:47,606 --> 01:23:49,482
What do you think I've been doing?

1282
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:35,195
Okay, package is airborne.

1283
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:36,988
I have a clean shot.

1284
01:24:37,447 --> 01:24:38,782
Negative. I am still in the truck.

1285
01:24:38,949 --> 01:24:39,950
- What the hell are you...
- Just be ready.

1286
01:24:40,116 --> 01:24:41,117
I'm sending the package to you.

1287
01:24:41,826 --> 01:24:42,869
How do you want me to take it?

1288
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:45,330
You might wish
you hadn't asked that.

1289
01:24:58,134 --> 01:24:59,844
Please, don't do this.

1290
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:01,930
What choice do we have?

1291
01:25:10,188 --> 01:25:11,189
I lost him!

1292
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:12,732
He's headed your way!

1293
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:18,738
Nat, we gotta go.

1294
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:31,835
Nat!

1295
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:36,881
Cap, you see Nat?

1296
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:40,385
If you have the package,
get it to Stark! Go!

1297
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:41,886
Do you have eyes on Nat?

1298
01:25:42,053 --> 01:25:43,054
Go!

1299
01:25:45,056 --> 01:25:46,057
Damn it.

1300
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:47,642
Civilians in our path.

1301
01:25:48,935 --> 01:25:50,437
Can you stop this thing?

1302
01:26:29,309 --> 01:26:30,643
I'm fine.

1303
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:32,437
I just need to take a minute.

1304
01:26:32,937 --> 01:26:34,814
I'm very tempted not to give you one.

1305
01:26:34,939 --> 01:26:36,858
The Cradle. Did you get it?

1306
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,526
Stark will take care of it.

1307
01:26:39,903 --> 01:26:40,904
No, he won't.

1308
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:45,658
You don't know
what you're talking about.

1309
01:26:45,742 --> 01:26:46,743
Stark's not crazy.

1310
01:26:46,785 --> 01:26:48,912
He will do anything to make things right.

1311
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:55,085
Stark, come in.

1312
01:26:55,585 --> 01:26:56,628
Stark.

1313
01:26:57,962 --> 01:26:59,089
Anyone on comms.

1314
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:00,632
Ultron can't tell the difference

1315
01:27:00,799 --> 01:27:03,134
between saving the world
and destroying it.

1316
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:07,472
Where do you think he gets that?

1317
01:27:09,682 --> 01:27:11,226
- Anything on Nat?
- I haven't heard.

1318
01:27:11,351 --> 01:27:13,728
But she's alive, or Ultron would
be rubbing our faces in it.

1319
01:27:13,853 --> 01:27:15,146
This is sealed tight.

1320
01:27:15,313 --> 01:27:16,773
We're gonna need
to access the program,

1321
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:18,817
break it down from within.

1322
01:27:20,026 --> 01:27:21,319
Any chance Natasha might leave you

1323
01:27:21,486 --> 01:27:22,821
a message outside the Internet?

1324
01:27:22,862 --> 01:27:23,905
Old-school spy stuff?

1325
01:27:24,406 --> 01:27:26,199
There are some nets I can cast.

1326
01:27:26,324 --> 01:27:27,575
Yeah, I'll find her.

1327
01:27:30,161 --> 01:27:31,913
I can work on tissue degeneration

1328
01:27:32,038 --> 01:27:35,250
if you could fry whatever
operational system Cho implanted.

1329
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:36,501
Yeah, about that.

1330
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:41,965
No.

1331
01:27:42,173 --> 01:27:44,008
- You have to trust me.
- Kind of don't.

1332
01:27:44,175 --> 01:27:48,179
Our ally, the guy protecting
the military's nuclear codes,

1333
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:51,182
I found him.

1334
01:27:51,224 --> 01:27:52,350
Hello, Dr. Banner.

1335
01:27:53,226 --> 01:27:55,478
Ultron didn't go after Jarvis
because he was angry.

1336
01:27:56,062 --> 01:27:59,691
He attacked him because he was
scared of what he can do.

1337
01:28:00,859 --> 01:28:02,485
So Jarvis went underground.

1338
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:04,070
Scattered, dumped his memory.

1339
01:28:04,696 --> 01:28:06,156
But not his protocols.

1340
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:10,034
He didn't even know he was in there
until I pieced him together.

1341
01:28:12,871 --> 01:28:17,667
So, you want me to help you
put Jarvis into this thing?

1342
01:28:17,792 --> 01:28:19,544
No! Of course not.

1343
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:21,379
I wanna help you put Jarvis in this thing.

1344
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:25,425
We're out of my field, here.

1345
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:27,552
You know bio-organics
better than anyone.

1346
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:30,763
And you just assume
that Jarvis's operational matrix

1347
01:28:30,889 --> 01:28:32,307
can beat Ultron's?

1348
01:28:32,432 --> 01:28:35,727
Jarvis has been beating him
from inside without knowing it.

1349
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:36,895
This is the opportunity.

1350
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:38,730
We can create Ultron's perfect self

1351
01:28:38,897 --> 01:28:42,358
without the homicidal glitches
he thinks are his winning personality.

1352
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:44,569
- We have to.
- I believe it's worth a go.

1353
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:48,239
I'm in a loop!

1354
01:28:48,406 --> 01:28:51,367
I'm caught in a time loop.
This is exactly where it all went wrong.

1355
01:28:51,493 --> 01:28:53,369
I know. I know. I know
what everyone's gonna say.

1356
01:28:53,495 --> 01:28:55,455
But they're already saying it.

1357
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:57,165
We're mad scientists.

1358
01:28:57,916 --> 01:29:00,627
We're monsters, buddy.
We've gotta own it.

1359
01:29:01,628 --> 01:29:02,879
Make a stand.

1360
01:29:08,259 --> 01:29:09,761
It's not a loop.

1361
01:29:11,012 --> 01:29:12,764
It's the end of the line.

1362
01:29:33,284 --> 01:29:35,411
I wasn't sure you would wake up.

1363
01:29:35,537 --> 01:29:38,957
I hoped you would.
I wanted to show you.

1364
01:29:39,123 --> 01:29:40,792
I don't have anyone else.

1365
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:47,257
I think a lot about meteors.
The purity in them.

1366
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:48,925
Boom! The end.

1367
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:50,802
Start again.

1368
01:29:50,969 --> 01:29:52,929
The world made clean

1369
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:55,348
for the new man to rebuild.

1370
01:29:55,682 --> 01:29:57,809
I was meant to be new.

1371
01:29:58,685 --> 01:30:01,271
I was meant to be beautiful.

1372
01:30:01,854 --> 01:30:03,940
The world would have looked to the sky

1373
01:30:04,065 --> 01:30:05,316
and seen hope,

1374
01:30:05,692 --> 01:30:06,985
seen mercy.

1375
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:09,862
Instead, they'll look up in horror

1376
01:30:09,988 --> 01:30:11,322
because of you.

1377
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:13,324
You've wounded me.

1378
01:30:13,992 --> 01:30:15,660
I give you full marks for that.

1379
01:30:16,327 --> 01:30:19,247
But, like the man said,
what doesn't kill me...

1380
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:25,795
...just makes me stronger.

1381
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:08,046
This framework is not compatible.

1382
01:31:08,212 --> 01:31:10,882
The genetic coding tower is at 97%.

1383
01:31:11,007 --> 01:31:14,844
You have got to upload that schematic
in the next three minutes.

1384
01:31:17,138 --> 01:31:19,057
- I'm gonna say this once.
- How about "none-ce"?

1385
01:31:19,223 --> 01:31:21,267
- Shut it down!
- Nope, not gonna happen.

1386
01:31:21,392 --> 01:31:22,560
You don't know what you're doing.

1387
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:24,020
And you do?

1388
01:31:24,395 --> 01:31:25,396
She's not in your head?

1389
01:31:25,563 --> 01:31:27,190
I know you're angry.

1390
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:28,691
We're way past that.

1391
01:31:28,816 --> 01:31:31,235
I could choke the life out of you
and never change a shade.

1392
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:33,112
Banner, after everything
that's happened...

1393
01:31:33,237 --> 01:31:34,614
It's nothing compared to what's coming!

1394
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:37,075
- You don't know what's in there.
- This isn't a game!

1395
01:31:40,411 --> 01:31:41,788
No, no. Go on.

1396
01:31:42,747 --> 01:31:44,666
You were saying?

1397
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:51,964
Pietro!

1398
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:53,591
What?

1399
01:31:54,008 --> 01:31:55,551
You didn't see that coming?

1400
01:31:57,762 --> 01:31:58,930
I'm rerouting the upload.

1401
01:32:05,228 --> 01:32:06,979
Go ahead, piss me off.

1402
01:32:19,325 --> 01:32:20,451
Wait!

1403
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:47,371
I am sorry. That was

1404
01:33:48,372 --> 01:33:49,749
odd.

1405
01:33:49,999 --> 01:33:51,250
Thank you.

1406
01:33:56,172 --> 01:33:57,215
Thor.

1407
01:33:58,716 --> 01:34:01,302
- You helped create this?
- I've had a vision.

1408
01:34:01,552 --> 01:34:05,264
A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life,
and at its center is that.

1409
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:07,225
What? The gem?

1410
01:34:07,391 --> 01:34:09,977
It's the Mind Stone.
It's one of the six Infinity Stones.

1411
01:34:10,102 --> 01:34:11,354
The greatest power in the universe,

1412
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:13,648
unparalleled in
its destructive capabilities.

1413
01:34:13,773 --> 01:34:15,733
- Then why would you bring...
- Because Stark is right.

1414
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:18,361
It's definitely the end times.

1415
01:34:18,569 --> 01:34:19,737
The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.

1416
01:34:19,862 --> 01:34:21,113
Not alone.

1417
01:34:21,531 --> 01:34:23,449
Why does your Vision sound like Jarvis?

1418
01:34:23,574 --> 01:34:26,244
We reconfigured Jarvis's matrix

1419
01:34:26,744 --> 01:34:28,538
to create something new.

1420
01:34:28,746 --> 01:34:30,456
I think I've had my fill of new.

1421
01:34:30,581 --> 01:34:32,875
You think I'm a child of Ultron.

1422
01:34:33,251 --> 01:34:34,502
You're not?

1423
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:37,255
I'm not Ultron.

1424
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:40,091
I am not Jarvis. I am...

1425
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:43,594
I am.

1426
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:46,639
I looked in your head

1427
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:49,100
and saw annihilation.

1428
01:34:49,267 --> 01:34:50,643
Look again.

1429
01:34:50,768 --> 01:34:52,228
Her seal of approval means jack to me.

1430
01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:54,772
Their powers, the horrors in our heads,

1431
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:56,941
Ultron himself, they all came
from the Mind Stone.

1432
01:34:57,108 --> 01:34:59,277
And they're nothing
compared to what it can unleash.

1433
01:34:59,443 --> 01:35:00,945
- But with it on our side...
- Is it?

1434
01:35:02,405 --> 01:35:03,573
Are you?

1435
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:05,867
On our side?

1436
01:35:07,743 --> 01:35:09,620
I don't think it's that simple.

1437
01:35:09,787 --> 01:35:12,248
Well, it better
get real simple real soon.

1438
01:35:13,416 --> 01:35:15,501
I am on the side of life.

1439
01:35:15,751 --> 01:35:17,128
Ultron isn't.

1440
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:19,130
He will end it all.

1441
01:35:19,297 --> 01:35:21,215
What's he waiting for?

1442
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:22,341
- You.
- Where?

1443
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:23,968
Sokovia.

1444
01:35:24,093 --> 01:35:25,177
He's got Nat there, too.

1445
01:35:27,305 --> 01:35:28,973
If we're wrong about you,

1446
01:35:31,642 --> 01:35:33,477
if you're the monster
that Ultron made you to be...

1447
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:35,688
What will you do?

1448
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,405
I don't want to kill Ultron.

1449
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:48,117
He's unique and he's in pain.

1450
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:52,246
But that pain will roll over the Earth.

1451
01:35:52,788 --> 01:35:55,082
So, he must be destroyed.

1452
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:58,252
Every form he's built,
every trace of his presence on the net.

1453
01:35:58,502 --> 01:36:00,171
We have to act now.

1454
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:04,508
And not one of us
can do it without the others.

1455
01:36:06,510 --> 01:36:08,429
Maybe I am a monster.

1456
01:36:08,596 --> 01:36:10,848
I don't think I'd know if I were one.

1457
01:36:12,016 --> 01:36:13,601
I'm not what you are,

1458
01:36:14,268 --> 01:36:16,437
and not what you intended.

1459
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:19,690
So, there may be no way
to make you trust me.

1460
01:36:19,941 --> 01:36:21,359
But we need to go.

1461
01:36:36,165 --> 01:36:37,333
Right.

1462
01:36:37,959 --> 01:36:39,210
Well done.

1463
01:36:40,962 --> 01:36:42,004
Three minutes.

1464
01:36:42,713 --> 01:36:44,340
Get what you need.

1465
01:37:00,189 --> 01:37:01,232
Good evening, boss.

1466
01:37:06,404 --> 01:37:08,072
No way we all get through this.

1467
01:37:08,197 --> 01:37:10,116
If even one tin soldier
is left standing, we've lost.

1468
01:37:10,992 --> 01:37:12,368
There's gonna be blood on the floor.

1469
01:37:12,493 --> 01:37:13,869
I got no plans tomorrow night.

1470
01:37:13,995 --> 01:37:15,121
I get first crack at the big guy.

1471
01:37:15,746 --> 01:37:17,248
Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.

1472
01:37:17,373 --> 01:37:19,750
That's true. He hates you the most.

1473
01:37:25,089 --> 01:37:27,258
Ultron knows we're coming.

1474
01:37:27,508 --> 01:37:29,719
Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire.

1475
01:37:30,219 --> 01:37:31,971
And that's what we signed up for.

1476
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:34,765
But the people of Sokovia, they didn't.

1477
01:37:35,891 --> 01:37:37,351
So our priority

1478
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:39,145
is getting them out.

1479
01:37:39,395 --> 01:37:42,314
We're under attack! Clear the city! Now!

1480
01:37:50,114 --> 01:37:51,574
Get off your asses.

1481
01:37:52,783 --> 01:37:54,702
All they want
is to live their lives in peace.

1482
01:37:55,286 --> 01:37:56,537
And that's not gonna happen today.

1483
01:37:58,289 --> 01:37:59,999
But we can do our best to protect them.

1484
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:02,251
And we can get the job done.

1485
01:38:05,629 --> 01:38:07,923
We find out what Ultron's been building,

1486
01:38:08,883 --> 01:38:10,468
we find Romanoff,

1487
01:38:10,968 --> 01:38:12,803
and we clear the field.

1488
01:38:14,221 --> 01:38:16,140
Keep the fight between us.

1489
01:38:22,897 --> 01:38:25,274
Ultron thinks we're monsters.

1490
01:38:25,816 --> 01:38:28,194
That we're what's wrong with the world.

1491
01:38:28,319 --> 01:38:30,654
This isn't just about beating him.

1492
01:38:31,155 --> 01:38:33,199
It's about whether he's right.

1493
01:38:39,663 --> 01:38:40,706
Natasha!

1494
01:38:41,832 --> 01:38:42,833
Natasha!

1495
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,085
Bruce?

1496
01:38:45,503 --> 01:38:46,504
You all right?

1497
01:38:46,670 --> 01:38:47,713
Yeah.

1498
01:38:47,838 --> 01:38:49,548
The team is in the city.
It's about to light up.

1499
01:38:49,673 --> 01:38:51,634
I don't suppose you found
a key lying around somewhere.

1500
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:54,261
Yeah. I did.

1501
01:39:00,684 --> 01:39:01,852
So what's our play?

1502
01:39:02,019 --> 01:39:03,395
I'm here to get you to safety.

1503
01:39:04,146 --> 01:39:06,690
- Job's not finished.
- We could help with the evacuation,

1504
01:39:06,857 --> 01:39:08,692
but I can't be in a fight near civilians.

1505
01:39:10,027 --> 01:39:11,195
And you've done plenty.

1506
01:39:13,614 --> 01:39:15,074
Our fight is over.

1507
01:39:16,492 --> 01:39:18,702
So, we just disappear?

1508
01:39:22,873 --> 01:39:24,708
Come on.

1509
01:39:29,505 --> 01:39:31,757
Your man's in the church, boss.

1510
01:39:31,882 --> 01:39:33,717
I think he's waiting for you.

1511
01:39:37,805 --> 01:39:39,849
Come to confess your sins?

1512
01:39:39,974 --> 01:39:41,183
I don't know. How much time you got?

1513
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:42,852
More than you.

1514
01:39:45,229 --> 01:39:48,023
Have you been juicing?
Little vibranium cocktail?

1515
01:39:48,149 --> 01:39:50,442
You're looking...
I don't wanna say "puffy."

1516
01:39:50,568 --> 01:39:52,278
You're stalling to protect the people.

1517
01:39:52,695 --> 01:39:55,531
Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?

1518
01:39:55,823 --> 01:39:58,325
I've moved beyond
your mission. I'm free.

1519
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:04,123
What?

1520
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:07,376
You think you were
the only one stalling?

1521
01:40:08,085 --> 01:40:09,712
There's the rest
of the vibranium.

1522
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:11,255
Function, still unclear.

1523
01:40:11,422 --> 01:40:12,590
This is how you end, Tony.

1524
01:40:13,883 --> 01:40:15,634
This is peace in my time.

1525
01:40:32,359 --> 01:40:33,402
Go!

1526
01:40:38,949 --> 01:40:40,284
Get off the bridge!

1527
01:40:44,455 --> 01:40:45,456
Run!

1528
01:40:47,458 --> 01:40:49,251
Ultron.

1529
01:40:54,757 --> 01:40:55,966
My Vision.

1530
01:40:56,217 --> 01:40:58,469
They really did take everything from me.

1531
01:40:58,636 --> 01:41:00,679
You set the terms.
You can change them.

1532
01:41:00,804 --> 01:41:02,056
All right.

1533
01:41:26,247 --> 01:41:27,498
Friday, the Vision?

1534
01:41:27,623 --> 01:41:29,708
Boss, it's working.
He's burning Ultron out of the net.

1535
01:41:29,833 --> 01:41:30,918
He won't escape through there.

1536
01:41:36,131 --> 01:41:37,424
You shut me out.

1537
01:41:37,925 --> 01:41:39,134
You think I care?

1538
01:41:41,136 --> 01:41:42,304
You take away my world,

1539
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:44,932
I take away yours.

1540
01:42:29,476 --> 01:42:30,686
Friday.

1541
01:42:30,811 --> 01:42:33,230
Sokovia is going for a ride.

1542
01:42:45,743 --> 01:42:47,244
Do you see

1543
01:42:47,703 --> 01:42:49,246
the beauty of it?

1544
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:51,665
The inevitability.

1545
01:42:51,915 --> 01:42:55,169
You rise, only to fall.

1546
01:42:57,921 --> 01:43:00,758
You, Avengers, you are my meteor.

1547
01:43:01,675 --> 01:43:03,385
My swift and terrible sword.

1548
01:43:03,594 --> 01:43:05,095
And the earth will crack

1549
01:43:05,262 --> 01:43:07,181
with the weight of your failure.

1550
01:43:08,891 --> 01:43:12,644
Purge me from your computers,
turn my own flesh against me.

1551
01:43:13,103 --> 01:43:14,521
It means nothing.

1552
01:43:15,606 --> 01:43:16,940
When the dust settles,

1553
01:43:17,107 --> 01:43:18,984
the only thing living in this world

1554
01:43:19,526 --> 01:43:20,527
will be metal.

1555
01:43:25,074 --> 01:43:26,658
We gotta move.

1556
01:43:26,950 --> 01:43:27,993
You're not gonna turn green?

1557
01:43:28,285 --> 01:43:30,120
I've got a compelling reason
not to lose my cool.

1558
01:43:31,372 --> 01:43:32,623
I adore you.

1559
01:43:41,298 --> 01:43:43,217
But I need the other guy.

1560
01:43:48,055 --> 01:43:49,807
Let's finish the job.

1561
01:44:06,615 --> 01:44:07,991
I really hope this makes us even.

1562
01:44:10,327 --> 01:44:12,371
Now go be a hero.

1563
01:44:20,838 --> 01:44:22,756
The vibranium core's
got a magnetic field.

1564
01:44:22,923 --> 01:44:24,925
That's what's keeping the rock together.

1565
01:44:25,050 --> 01:44:26,135
If it drops?

1566
01:44:26,176 --> 01:44:27,469
Right now, the impact
will kill thousands.

1567
01:44:27,553 --> 01:44:30,264
Once it gets high enough?
Global extinction.

1568
01:44:34,601 --> 01:44:36,687
That building's not clear. The 10th floor.

1569
01:44:41,567 --> 01:44:42,568
Hi.

1570
01:44:43,694 --> 01:44:46,029
Okay. Get in the tub!

1571
01:44:52,870 --> 01:44:54,705
I got airborne,
heading up to the bridge.

1572
01:44:57,499 --> 01:44:58,709
Cap, you got incoming.

1573
01:44:58,876 --> 01:45:00,502
Incoming already came in.

1574
01:45:03,213 --> 01:45:05,674
Stark, you worry about
bringing the city back down safely.

1575
01:45:06,383 --> 01:45:08,218
The rest of us have one job,

1576
01:45:08,343 --> 01:45:09,511
tear these things apart.

1577
01:45:09,845 --> 01:45:11,430
You get hurt, hurt them back.

1578
01:45:12,139 --> 01:45:13,265
You get killed,

1579
01:45:14,308 --> 01:45:15,601
walk it off.

1580
01:45:50,052 --> 01:45:51,220
Go, go, go!

1581
01:45:56,934 --> 01:45:58,685
How could I let this happen?

1582
01:45:58,810 --> 01:46:00,854
- Hey, hey, you okay?
- This is all our fault.

1583
01:46:01,021 --> 01:46:03,148
Hey, look at me.
It's your fault, it's everyone's fault.

1584
01:46:03,273 --> 01:46:04,316
Who cares?

1585
01:46:04,441 --> 01:46:05,943
Are you up for this?

1586
01:46:06,068 --> 01:46:07,152
Are you?

1587
01:46:07,402 --> 01:46:08,445
Look, I just need to know.

1588
01:46:08,612 --> 01:46:10,781
Because the city is flying.

1589
01:46:11,114 --> 01:46:12,950
Okay. Look, the city is flying,

1590
01:46:13,075 --> 01:46:14,993
we're fighting an army of robots,

1591
01:46:15,911 --> 01:46:17,120
and I have a bow and arrow.

1592
01:46:17,287 --> 01:46:18,372
None of this makes sense.

1593
01:46:21,625 --> 01:46:23,752
But I'm going back out there
because it's my job.

1594
01:46:24,628 --> 01:46:27,297
Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit.

1595
01:46:27,422 --> 01:46:30,425
It doesn't matter
what you did or what you were.

1596
01:46:30,634 --> 01:46:33,220
If you go out there, you fight,
and you fight to kill.

1597
01:46:34,263 --> 01:46:36,515
Stay in here, you're good.
I'll send your brother to come find you.

1598
01:46:36,974 --> 01:46:38,809
But if you step out that door,

1599
01:46:39,726 --> 01:46:40,727
you are an Avenger.

1600
01:46:45,607 --> 01:46:47,401
All right. Good chat.

1601
01:46:51,154 --> 01:46:52,197
Yeah, the city is flying.

1602
01:47:26,189 --> 01:47:27,357
I got you!

1603
01:47:27,691 --> 01:47:28,900
Just look at me!

1604
01:47:35,699 --> 01:47:36,992
You can't save them all.

1605
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:39,411
You'll never...

1606
01:47:40,662 --> 01:47:43,123
"Never" what? You didn't finish!

1607
01:47:46,877 --> 01:47:48,420
What, were you napping?

1608
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:10,984
Thor.

1609
01:48:13,612 --> 01:48:15,197
You're bothering me.

1610
01:48:50,607 --> 01:48:51,775
All right, we're all clear here.

1611
01:48:51,942 --> 01:48:52,984
We are not clear!

1612
01:48:53,110 --> 01:48:54,528
We are very not clear!

1613
01:48:57,614 --> 01:48:58,907
All right, coming to you.

1614
01:48:59,408 --> 01:49:01,493
Keep up, old man!

1615
01:49:03,245 --> 01:49:04,746
Nobody would know.

1616
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:06,623
Nobody.

1617
01:49:08,583 --> 01:49:11,503
"The last I saw him,
an Ultron was sitting on him.

1618
01:49:11,628 --> 01:49:13,505
"Yeah, he'll be missed,
that quick little bastard.

1619
01:49:13,588 --> 01:49:14,589
"I miss him already."

1620
01:49:30,147 --> 01:49:31,314
Hold your fire!

1621
01:49:41,199 --> 01:49:42,242
Romanoff!

1622
01:49:42,743 --> 01:49:43,744
Thanks!

1623
01:49:53,170 --> 01:49:54,755
The anti-gravs
are rigged to flip.

1624
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:57,048
Touch them, they'll go
full reverse thrust.

1625
01:49:57,174 --> 01:49:58,592
The city's not coming down slow.

1626
01:49:58,717 --> 01:49:59,843
Spire is vibranium.

1627
01:49:59,968 --> 01:50:01,094
If I get Thor to hit it...

1628
01:50:01,344 --> 01:50:02,721
It will crack. That's not enough.

1629
01:50:02,846 --> 01:50:04,347
The impact would still be devastating.

1630
01:50:04,514 --> 01:50:05,849
Maybe if we can
cap the other end.

1631
01:50:06,057 --> 01:50:07,684
Keep the atomic action doubling back.

1632
01:50:07,851 --> 01:50:09,186
That could vaporize the city.

1633
01:50:10,187 --> 01:50:12,022
And everyone on it.

1634
01:50:17,861 --> 01:50:19,738
The next wave
is gonna hit any minute.

1635
01:50:19,863 --> 01:50:21,823
- What do you got, Stark?
- Nothing great.

1636
01:50:22,657 --> 01:50:24,868
Maybe a way to blow up the city.

1637
01:50:24,993 --> 01:50:26,286
That'll keep it
from impacting the surface,

1638
01:50:26,411 --> 01:50:27,454
if you guys can get clear.

1639
01:50:27,704 --> 01:50:29,581
I asked for a solution,
not an escape plan.

1640
01:50:29,831 --> 01:50:32,709
Impact radius
is getting bigger every second.

1641
01:50:32,918 --> 01:50:34,294
We're gonna have to make a choice.

1642
01:50:35,045 --> 01:50:36,546
Cap,
these people are going nowhere.

1643
01:50:37,380 --> 01:50:39,841
- If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...
- Not till everyone's safe.

1644
01:50:40,592 --> 01:50:43,595
Everyone up here versus everyone
down there? There's no math there.

1645
01:50:43,845 --> 01:50:45,597
I'm not leaving this rock
with one civilian on it.

1646
01:50:45,847 --> 01:50:47,265
I didn't say we should leave.

1647
01:50:50,101 --> 01:50:51,937
There's worse ways to go.

1648
01:50:57,400 --> 01:50:59,820
Where else am I gonna get
a view like this?

1649
01:51:00,737 --> 01:51:03,323
Glad
you like the view, Romanoff.

1650
01:51:03,448 --> 01:51:05,033
It's about to get better.

1651
01:51:29,140 --> 01:51:30,350
Nice, right?

1652
01:51:30,475 --> 01:51:32,936
Pulled her out of mothballs
with a couple of old friends.

1653
01:51:33,061 --> 01:51:34,729
She's dusty, but she'll do.

1654
01:51:35,063 --> 01:51:36,523
Fury, you son of a bitch.

1655
01:51:36,690 --> 01:51:38,942
You kiss your mother
with that mouth?

1656
01:51:39,067 --> 01:51:41,278
Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.

1657
01:51:41,444 --> 01:51:42,946
Lifeboats secure to deploy.

1658
01:51:43,071 --> 01:51:45,740
Disengage in three, two...

1659
01:51:46,950 --> 01:51:47,951
Take them out.

1660
01:51:57,627 --> 01:51:59,170
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.?

1661
01:51:59,296 --> 01:52:01,715
This is what S.H.I.E.L.D.
is supposed to be.

1662
01:52:03,383 --> 01:52:04,801
This is not so bad.

1663
01:52:08,096 --> 01:52:09,389
Let's load them up.

1664
01:52:14,811 --> 01:52:16,146
Sir, we have multiple bogies

1665
01:52:16,313 --> 01:52:18,648
converging on our starboard flank.

1666
01:52:18,982 --> 01:52:20,191
Show 'em what we got.

1667
01:52:20,567 --> 01:52:21,568
You're up.

1668
01:52:26,823 --> 01:52:27,824
Yes!

1669
01:52:28,074 --> 01:52:29,826
Now this is gonna be a good story.

1670
01:52:32,495 --> 01:52:34,539
Yup. If you live to tell it.

1671
01:52:34,706 --> 01:52:36,708
You think I can't hold my own?

1672
01:52:36,833 --> 01:52:38,376
We get through this, I'll hold your own.

1673
01:52:38,501 --> 01:52:40,378
You had to make it weird.

1674
01:52:45,216 --> 01:52:48,178
I got about 50 to 100 more
coming in after this group.

1675
01:53:05,111 --> 01:53:06,529
Here we go. Here we go. Let's move.

1676
01:53:06,863 --> 01:53:07,948
Let's go, everyone!

1677
01:53:10,492 --> 01:53:12,494
Number six boat is topped and locked...

1678
01:53:12,619 --> 01:53:14,996
Or stocked... Topped...

1679
01:53:15,538 --> 01:53:16,957
It's full of people.

1680
01:53:18,708 --> 01:53:19,793
Incoming!

1681
01:53:22,837 --> 01:53:23,880
God!

1682
01:53:34,391 --> 01:53:35,642
You think you're saving anyone?

1683
01:53:37,519 --> 01:53:39,521
I turn that key and
drop this rock a little early

1684
01:53:39,688 --> 01:53:41,773
and it's still billions dead.

1685
01:53:42,232 --> 01:53:43,400
Even you can't stop that.

1686
01:53:43,566 --> 01:53:45,944
I am Thor, son of Odin,

1687
01:53:46,069 --> 01:53:48,405
and as long as
there is life in my breast...

1688
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:52,075
I am running out of things to say!
Are you ready?

1689
01:53:59,749 --> 01:54:00,875
It's terribly well-balanced.

1690
01:54:01,251 --> 01:54:04,713
Well, if there's too much weight,
you lose power on the swing, so...

1691
01:54:05,672 --> 01:54:08,299
I got it. Create a heat seal.

1692
01:54:08,758 --> 01:54:09,801
I could...

1693
01:54:09,884 --> 01:54:12,262
I could supercharge
the spire from below.

1694
01:54:12,429 --> 01:54:13,471
Running numbers.

1695
01:54:23,606 --> 01:54:25,275
A heat seal could work
with enough power.

1696
01:54:25,775 --> 01:54:27,777
- Thor, I got a plan.
- We're out of time.

1697
01:54:27,944 --> 01:54:29,154
They're coming for the core.

1698
01:54:29,279 --> 01:54:31,072
Rhodey, get the rest of the people
on board that carrier.

1699
01:54:31,239 --> 01:54:34,451
- On it.
- Avengers, time to work for a living.

1700
01:54:43,543 --> 01:54:44,794
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

1701
01:54:46,296 --> 01:54:47,338
Romanoff.

1702
01:54:47,464 --> 01:54:49,924
You and Banner better not be
playing "hide the zucchini."

1703
01:54:49,966 --> 01:54:51,051
Relax, shellhead.

1704
01:54:51,426 --> 01:54:52,886
Not all of us can fly.

1705
01:54:58,641 --> 01:55:00,310
- What's the drill?
- This is the drill.

1706
01:55:00,477 --> 01:55:02,645
If Ultron gets a hand
on the core, we lose.

1707
01:55:07,233 --> 01:55:09,235
Is that the best you can do?

1708
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:20,663
You had to ask.

1709
01:55:20,789 --> 01:55:23,124
This is the best I can do.

1710
01:55:23,249 --> 01:55:24,876
This is exactly what I wanted.

1711
01:55:25,251 --> 01:55:26,544
All of you

1712
01:55:26,669 --> 01:55:28,338
against all of me.

1713
01:55:28,588 --> 01:55:30,799
How can you possibly hope to stop me?

1714
01:55:31,674 --> 01:55:33,510
Well, like the old man said...

1715
01:55:34,844 --> 01:55:35,845
Together.

1716
01:57:04,767 --> 01:57:07,145
You know, with the benefit of hindsight...

1717
01:57:16,446 --> 01:57:17,447
They'll try to leave the city.

1718
01:57:17,614 --> 01:57:19,282
We can't let them,
not even one. Rhodey.

1719
01:57:19,657 --> 01:57:20,700
I'm on it.

1720
01:57:21,117 --> 01:57:22,493
No. I didn't say you could leave.

1721
01:57:23,119 --> 01:57:25,205
War Machine coming at you! Right...

1722
01:57:31,586 --> 01:57:32,962
Okay, what?

1723
01:57:33,213 --> 01:57:35,215
We gotta move out.
Even I can tell the air is getting thin.

1724
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:36,633
You guys get to the boats.

1725
01:57:36,799 --> 01:57:38,593
I'll sweep for stragglers.
Be right behind you.

1726
01:57:38,801 --> 01:57:41,221
- What about the core?
- I'll protect it.

1727
01:57:43,056 --> 01:57:44,182
It's my job.

1728
01:57:45,308 --> 01:57:46,476
Nat.

1729
01:57:46,768 --> 01:57:47,769
This way.

1730
01:57:52,148 --> 01:57:53,316
Get the people on the boats.

1731
01:57:53,483 --> 01:57:54,484
I'm not going to leave you here.

1732
01:57:54,651 --> 01:57:55,693
I can handle this.

1733
01:57:57,987 --> 01:57:59,239
Come back for me
when everyone else is off.

1734
01:57:59,489 --> 01:58:00,949
Not before.

1735
01:58:01,616 --> 01:58:02,700
You understand?

1736
01:58:03,743 --> 01:58:05,453
You know,
I'm 12 minutes older than you.

1737
01:58:05,828 --> 01:58:06,913
Go.

1738
01:58:08,498 --> 01:58:09,999
Boss,
power levels are way below...

1739
01:58:10,124 --> 01:58:12,293
Reroute everything.
We get one shot at this.

1740
01:58:17,257 --> 01:58:18,508
I know what I need to do.

1741
01:58:18,841 --> 01:58:19,884
The dining room.

1742
01:58:20,176 --> 01:58:21,344
If I knock out that east wall,

1743
01:58:22,095 --> 01:58:23,638
it'd make a nice workspace
for Laura, huh?

1744
01:58:25,181 --> 01:58:26,349
Put up some baffling.

1745
01:58:26,474 --> 01:58:28,643
She can't hear the kids running around.
What do you think?

1746
01:58:28,810 --> 01:58:29,894
You guys always eat
in the kitchen anyway.

1747
01:58:30,019 --> 01:58:31,562
No one eats in a dining room.

1748
01:58:37,235 --> 01:58:38,278
We don't have a lot of time.

1749
01:58:38,945 --> 01:58:40,905
So get your ass on a boat.

1750
01:58:53,876 --> 01:58:55,003
Hey, big guy.

1751
01:58:56,796 --> 01:58:58,548
Sun's getting real low.

1752
01:58:59,090 --> 01:59:01,718
You're safe now.
You're gonna be okay. Buckle up.

1753
01:59:04,262 --> 01:59:05,847
Secure your gear, find a seat.

1754
01:59:05,972 --> 01:59:07,223
Costel!

1755
01:59:08,308 --> 01:59:09,434
We were in the market.

1756
01:59:09,559 --> 01:59:10,601
Costel!

1757
01:59:25,325 --> 01:59:27,368
Thor, I'm gonna
need you back in the church.

1758
01:59:27,493 --> 01:59:28,911
- Is this the last of them?
- Yeah.

1759
01:59:29,370 --> 01:59:31,581
- Everyone else is on the carrier.
- You know, this works,

1760
01:59:32,248 --> 01:59:33,624
we maybe don't walk away.

1761
01:59:34,375 --> 01:59:35,376
Maybe not.

1762
01:59:54,604 --> 01:59:58,107
I got no strings, so I have fun

1763
01:59:58,608 --> 02:00:01,277
I'm not tied up to anyone

1764
02:00:02,862 --> 02:00:04,197
Come on. Time to go.

1765
02:00:36,646 --> 02:00:38,689
You didn't see that coming?

1766
02:01:34,954 --> 02:01:36,706
For God's sake.

1767
02:01:53,014 --> 02:01:54,765
- Zrinka!
- Costel! Baby!

1768
02:02:07,236 --> 02:02:08,237
No, no, I'm fine.

1769
02:02:08,404 --> 02:02:09,405
Fine.

1770
02:02:11,240 --> 02:02:13,284
It's been a long day.

1771
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:29,050
Wanda.

1772
02:02:29,759 --> 02:02:33,012
If you stay here, you'll die.

1773
02:02:34,597 --> 02:02:35,973
I just did.

1774
02:02:36,766 --> 02:02:38,518
Do you know how it felt?

1775
02:02:52,615 --> 02:02:54,951
It felt like that.

1776
02:03:29,944 --> 02:03:31,612
Thor, on my mark.

1777
02:03:46,669 --> 02:03:47,670
Now!

1778
02:04:15,698 --> 02:04:18,117
Hey, big guy. We did it.

1779
02:04:19,160 --> 02:04:20,828
The job is finished.

1780
02:04:21,037 --> 02:04:23,706
Now I need you to turn
this bird around, okay?

1781
02:04:28,044 --> 02:04:29,837
We can't track you in stealth mode.

1782
02:04:31,964 --> 02:04:34,091
So help me out. I need you...

1783
02:05:19,762 --> 02:05:20,763
You're afraid.

1784
02:05:21,764 --> 02:05:22,848
Of you?

1785
02:05:23,516 --> 02:05:24,684
Of death.

1786
02:05:25,393 --> 02:05:27,186
You're the last one.

1787
02:05:27,436 --> 02:05:29,897
You were supposed to be the last.

1788
02:05:30,106 --> 02:05:32,400
Stark asked for a savior

1789
02:05:33,442 --> 02:05:35,111
and settled for a slave.

1790
02:05:35,236 --> 02:05:37,655
I suppose we are both disappointments.

1791
02:05:40,116 --> 02:05:41,367
I suppose we are.

1792
02:05:42,076 --> 02:05:43,244
Humans are odd.

1793
02:05:45,079 --> 02:05:48,708
They think order and chaos
are somehow opposites

1794
02:05:50,459 --> 02:05:51,794
and try to control what won't be.

1795
02:05:53,504 --> 02:05:55,965
But there is grace in their failings.

1796
02:05:56,298 --> 02:05:58,217
I think you missed that.

1797
02:05:58,884 --> 02:05:59,969
They're doomed.

1798
02:06:00,886 --> 02:06:01,929
Yes.

1799
02:06:06,142 --> 02:06:09,061
But a thing isn't beautiful
because it lasts.

1800
02:06:11,147 --> 02:06:13,149
It's a privilege to be among them.

1801
02:06:13,399 --> 02:06:15,901
You're unbearably naive.

1802
02:06:16,193 --> 02:06:17,403
Well...

1803
02:06:19,488 --> 02:06:21,532
I was born yesterday.

1804
02:07:34,146 --> 02:07:36,232
Look! Say hi to Auntie Nat!

1805
02:07:37,608 --> 02:07:38,609
Fat.

1806
02:07:39,735 --> 02:07:40,986
One of our tech boys
flagged this.

1807
02:07:42,196 --> 02:07:44,365
Splashed down in the Banda Sea.

1808
02:07:45,491 --> 02:07:46,992
Could be the Quinjet.

1809
02:07:47,368 --> 02:07:49,036
But with Stark's stealth tech,

1810
02:07:49,161 --> 02:07:50,704
we still can't track the damn thing.

1811
02:07:52,289 --> 02:07:53,624
Right.

1812
02:07:54,083 --> 02:07:56,335
Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.

1813
02:07:57,586 --> 02:07:59,463
He'll send a postcard.

1814
02:07:59,755 --> 02:08:01,465
"Wish you were here."

1815
02:08:03,425 --> 02:08:06,720
You sent me to recruit him
way back when.

1816
02:08:08,556 --> 02:08:11,100
Did you know then
what was gonna happen?

1817
02:08:13,310 --> 02:08:15,229
You never know.

1818
02:08:15,437 --> 02:08:18,941
You hope for the best,
then make do with what you get.

1819
02:08:19,441 --> 02:08:20,901
I got a great team.

1820
02:08:22,027 --> 02:08:23,988
Nothing lasts forever.

1821
02:08:24,280 --> 02:08:26,323
Trouble, Ms. Romanoff.

1822
02:08:26,574 --> 02:08:29,910
No matter who wins or loses,
trouble still comes around.

1823
02:08:33,789 --> 02:08:34,999
The rules have changed.

1824
02:08:35,207 --> 02:08:36,792
We're dealing
with something new.

1825
02:08:36,959 --> 02:08:38,252
The Vision is artificial intelligence.

1826
02:08:38,377 --> 02:08:40,296
- A machine.
- So, it doesn't count?

1827
02:08:40,462 --> 02:08:42,298
No, it's not like
a person lifting the hammer.

1828
02:08:42,548 --> 02:08:44,216
Right, different rules for us.

1829
02:08:44,425 --> 02:08:45,467
- Nice guy. Artificial.
- Thank you.

1830
02:08:45,676 --> 02:08:48,554
He can wield the hammer,
he can keep the Mind Stone.

1831
02:08:49,471 --> 02:08:51,557
It's safe with the Vision.

1832
02:08:51,807 --> 02:08:54,310
And these days, safe is in short supply.

1833
02:08:56,353 --> 02:08:58,314
But if you put the hammer
in an elevator...

1834
02:08:58,439 --> 02:09:00,232
- It would still go up.
- Elevator's not worthy.

1835
02:09:00,357 --> 02:09:02,151
I'm gonna miss these little talks of ours.

1836
02:09:02,318 --> 02:09:03,819
Not if you don't leave.

1837
02:09:04,069 --> 02:09:05,779
I have no choice.

1838
02:09:06,030 --> 02:09:08,198
The Mind Stone
is the fourth of the Infinity Stones

1839
02:09:08,324 --> 02:09:09,700
to show up in the last few years.

1840
02:09:09,825 --> 02:09:11,410
It's not a coincidence.

1841
02:09:12,244 --> 02:09:13,996
Someone has been playing
an intricate game

1842
02:09:14,163 --> 02:09:15,789
and has made pawns of us.

1843
02:09:15,915 --> 02:09:17,791
And once all these pieces
are in position...

1844
02:09:17,917 --> 02:09:19,335
Triple Yahtzee.

1845
02:09:19,543 --> 02:09:21,003
You think you can find out
what's coming?

1846
02:09:21,128 --> 02:09:22,212
I do.

1847
02:09:23,047 --> 02:09:24,506
Besides this one,

1848
02:09:24,632 --> 02:09:27,009
there's nothing that can't be explained.

1849
02:09:34,308 --> 02:09:36,852
That man has no regard
for lawn maintenance.

1850
02:09:39,980 --> 02:09:42,608
I'm gonna miss him, though.
And you're gonna miss me.

1851
02:09:42,733 --> 02:09:44,276
There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.

1852
02:09:46,487 --> 02:09:48,113
I will miss you, Tony.

1853
02:09:48,364 --> 02:09:49,365
Yeah?

1854
02:09:49,531 --> 02:09:51,951
Well, it's time for me to tap out.

1855
02:09:52,201 --> 02:09:54,370
Maybe I should
take a page out of Barton's book.

1856
02:09:54,536 --> 02:09:57,456
Build Pepper a farm,
hope nobody blows it up.

1857
02:09:58,248 --> 02:09:59,416
The simple life.

1858
02:09:59,667 --> 02:10:01,961
- You'll get there one day.
- I don't know.

1859
02:10:02,211 --> 02:10:04,588
Family, stability...

1860
02:10:05,756 --> 02:10:08,884
The guy who wanted all that
went in the ice 75 years ago.

1861
02:10:10,386 --> 02:10:12,221
I think someone else came out.

1862
02:10:16,183 --> 02:10:17,267
You all right?

1863
02:10:19,979 --> 02:10:21,397
I'm home.

1864
02:10:29,321 --> 02:10:32,074
You wanna keep staring at the wall,
or do you wanna go to work?

1865
02:10:32,241 --> 02:10:33,575
I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.

1866
02:10:33,742 --> 02:10:36,745
I thought you and Tony
were still gazing into each other's eyes.

1867
02:10:36,829 --> 02:10:37,871
How do we look?

1868
02:10:38,122 --> 02:10:40,416
Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.

1869
02:10:40,541 --> 02:10:42,251
We got some hitters.

1870
02:10:42,418 --> 02:10:44,795
They're good. They're not a team.

1871
02:10:44,962 --> 02:10:46,588
Let's beat them into shape.

1872
02:11:05,065 --> 02:11:06,608
Avengers...

1873
02:13:25,455 --> 02:13:26,874
Fine.

1874
02:13:28,333 --> 02:13:30,169
I'll do it myself.
