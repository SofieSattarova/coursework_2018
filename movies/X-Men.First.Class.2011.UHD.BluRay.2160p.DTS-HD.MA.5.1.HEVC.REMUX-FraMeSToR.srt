1
00:01:25,412 --> 00:01:26,871
Mama!

2
00:01:35,463 --> 00:01:36,631
Mama!

3
00:01:42,595 --> 00:01:43,930
Mama!

4
00:02:48,786 --> 00:02:51,998
Mother. What are you...

5
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:54,417
I thought you were a burglar.

6
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:57,337
I didn't mean to scare you, darling.
I was just getting a snack.

7
00:02:57,545 --> 00:02:59,631
Go back to bed.

8
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,467
What's the matter?

9
00:03:02,634 --> 00:03:04,928
Go on, back to bed.

10
00:03:06,513 --> 00:03:08,473
I'll make you a hot chocolate.

11
00:03:09,307 --> 00:03:10,433
Who are you?

12
00:03:15,146 --> 00:03:16,981
And what have you done with my mother?

13
00:03:17,148 --> 00:03:21,319
<i>My mother has never set foot
in this kitchen in her life.</i>

14
00:03:21,986 --> 00:03:25,156
<i>And she certainly never
made me a hot chocolate.</i>

15
00:03:25,448 --> 00:03:28,076
<i>Unless you count ordering
the maid to do it.</i>

16
00:03:46,261 --> 00:03:48,304
You're not scared of me?

17
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,849
I always believed I couldn't be
the only one in the world.

18
00:03:52,517 --> 00:03:54,310
The only person who was

19
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,437
different.

20
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,232
And here you are.

21
00:03:59,816 --> 00:04:01,025
Charles Xavier.

22
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,613
Raven.

23
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:08,575
You're hungry and alone.

24
00:04:08,992 --> 00:04:10,451
Take whatever you want.

25
00:04:10,577 --> 00:04:14,038
We've got lots of food.
You don't have to steal.

26
00:04:14,414 --> 00:04:16,958
In fact,

27
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,793
you never have to steal again.

28
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:35,518
<font color="#ffff00">Understand this, Erik...</font>

29
00:04:36,561 --> 00:04:39,439
<font color="#ffff00">These Nazis, I'm not like them.</font>

30
00:04:43,776 --> 00:04:46,070
<font color="#ffff00">Genes are the key, yes?</font>

31
00:04:47,238 --> 00:04:49,324
<font color="#ffff00">But their goals?</font>

32
00:04:49,407 --> 00:04:53,870
<font color="#ffff00">Blue eyes? Blond Hair? Pathetic.</font>

33
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:00,960
<font color="#ffff00">Eat the chocolate.</font>

34
00:05:02,003 --> 00:05:03,046
<font color="#ffff00">It's good.</font>

35
00:05:03,838 --> 00:05:04,881
<font color="#ffff00">Want some?</font>

36
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:09,177
<font color="#ffff00">I want to see my mama.</font>

37
00:05:16,017 --> 00:05:21,439
<font color="#ffff00">Genes are the key that unlocks
the door to a new age, Erik.</font>

38
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:25,526
<font color="#ffff00">A new future for mankind.</font>

39
00:05:25,985 --> 00:05:28,696
<font color="#ffff00">Evolution.</font>

40
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,865
<font color="#ffff00">You know what I'm talking about?</font>

41
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:35,953
<font color="#ffff00">It's a simple thing I ask of you.</font>

42
00:05:36,245 --> 00:05:41,042
<font color="#ffff00">A little coin is nothing
compared to a big gate.</font>

43
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,628
<font color="#ffff00">Is it?</font>

44
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,014
<i>Ja.</i>

45
00:05:58,685 --> 00:06:00,603
<font color="#ffff00">I tried, Herr Doctor.</font>

46
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,982
<font color="#ffff00">I can't... I don't...</font>

47
00:06:05,024 --> 00:06:06,693
<font color="#ffff00">It's impossible.</font>

48
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:14,409
<font color="#ffff00">The one thing I can say for the Nazis
is their methods seem to produce results.</font>

49
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:19,288
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry, Erik.</font>

50
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:31,509
<font color="#ffff00">Mama!</font>

51
00:06:32,427 --> 00:06:33,720
<font color="#ffff00">My darling.</font>

52
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:35,722
<font color="#ffff00">How are you?</font>

53
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:41,185
<font color="#ffff00">Here's what we're going to do.</font>

54
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:44,480
<font color="#ffff00">I'm going to count to three...</font>

55
00:06:46,023 --> 00:06:48,401
<font color="#ffff00">...and you're going to move the coin.</font>

56
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,489
<font color="#ffff00">You don't move the coin,
I pull the trigger.</font>

57
00:06:56,284 --> 00:06:57,452
<font color="#ffff00">Understand?</font>

58
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,913
<font color="#ffff00">One</font>

59
00:07:01,456 --> 00:07:02,498
Mama.

60
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:03,791
<font color="#ffff00">You can do it.</font>

61
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,089
<font color="#ffff00">Two</font>

62
00:07:13,134 --> 00:07:14,385
<font color="#ffff00">Everything is all right.</font>

63
00:07:30,777 --> 00:07:31,819
<font color="#ffff00">Three.</font>

64
00:07:53,257 --> 00:07:55,051
<font color="#ffff00">Yes. Wonderful.</font>

65
00:08:05,144 --> 00:08:06,145
<font color="#ffff00">Excellent.</font>

66
00:08:17,365 --> 00:08:20,827
<i>Nein!</i>

67
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,316
<font color="#ffff00">Outstanding, Erik.</font>

68
00:08:53,651 --> 00:08:57,196
<font color="#ffff00">So we unlock your gift with anger.</font>

69
00:08:58,614 --> 00:09:01,659
<font color="#ffff00">Anger and pain.</font>

70
00:09:04,287 --> 00:09:05,913
<font color="#ffff00">You and me...</font>

71
00:09:07,123 --> 00:09:10,001
<font color="#ffff00">...we're going to have a lot of fun together.</font>

72
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,409
Heterochromia.

73
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:29,580
A gentleman would at least
offer to buy me a drink first.

74
00:10:30,373 --> 00:10:34,293
Norman, a pint of bitter for me
and a brandy for the lady, please.

75
00:10:34,377 --> 00:10:35,795
- How did you know that?
- Lucky guess.

76
00:10:36,128 --> 00:10:38,005
My name is Xavier. Charles Xavier.

77
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:39,298
- How do you do?
- Amy.

78
00:10:39,382 --> 00:10:41,300
Heterochromia was
in reference to your eyes,

79
00:10:41,384 --> 00:10:43,886
which I have to say are stunning.

80
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:45,596
One green, one blue.

81
00:10:45,805 --> 00:10:47,890
It's a mutation.
It's a very groovy mutation.

82
00:10:47,932 --> 00:10:49,517
I've got news for you, Amy.

83
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,143
You are a mutant.

84
00:10:51,435 --> 00:10:54,939
First you proposition a girl,
and then you call her deformed.

85
00:10:54,981 --> 00:10:57,149
How is that seduction
technique working for you?

86
00:10:57,233 --> 00:10:58,317
I'll tell you in the morning.

87
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,570
No, seriously, though,
you mustn't knock it.

88
00:11:01,612 --> 00:11:03,447
Mutation took us from
single-celled organisms

89
00:11:03,489 --> 00:11:06,951
to being the dominant form
of reproductive life on this planet.

90
00:11:06,993 --> 00:11:10,121
Infinite forms of variation
with each generation,

91
00:11:10,246 --> 00:11:12,915
all through mutation.

92
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,876
Then let's reclaim that word.

93
00:11:20,172 --> 00:11:22,508
- Mutant and proud.
- Chin-chin. Hey.

94
00:11:22,591 --> 00:11:25,302
- I guess I have to buy my own drink.
- I'm sorry. One cola.

95
00:11:25,761 --> 00:11:26,846
Charles here was just telling me

96
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:29,348
that I'm like one of the first
sea creatures that grew legs.

97
00:11:29,432 --> 00:11:31,392
A tiny bit sexier.

98
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:34,478
I'm sorry. This is my sister, Raven.

99
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,813
- Hi.
- Amy.

100
00:11:36,105 --> 00:11:38,441
- And what do you study?
- Waitressing.

101
00:11:42,862 --> 00:11:44,488
Oh, look, you have heterochromia, too.

102
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:47,491
- Sorry, what?
- Look at her eye.

103
00:11:50,327 --> 00:11:52,913
Right. Raven, get your coat, please.

104
00:11:53,372 --> 00:11:55,082
Don't talk to me. You did that on purpose.

105
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,293
- I did not! Why would I do it on purpose?
- Yes, you did!

106
00:11:57,334 --> 00:11:59,712
You know I can't control it
sometimes if I'm stressed or tired.

107
00:11:59,795 --> 00:12:02,715
You seem to be doing a perfectly
good job right now.

108
00:12:02,798 --> 00:12:04,592
- "Mutant and proud."
- What?

109
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:08,137
Or is it only with pretty mutations,
or invisible ones like yours?

110
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:09,764
But if you're a freak, you better hide.

111
00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:12,016
You're being ridiculous.

112
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:14,185
I don't mean to sound like an old fart.

113
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:16,562
- Which you are.
- Sometimes.

114
00:12:17,021 --> 00:12:19,440
But we've talked about this, Raven.

115
00:12:19,523 --> 00:12:22,902
A small slip-up is one thing.
A big one does not bear thinking about.

116
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:31,410
"Mutant and proud."

117
00:12:33,871 --> 00:12:36,040
"Mutant and proud"?

118
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:48,260
If only.

119
00:12:54,225 --> 00:12:56,477
- Would you date me?
- Of course I would.

120
00:12:56,936 --> 00:12:59,855
Any young man would be lucky
to have you. You are stunning.

121
00:12:59,897 --> 00:13:01,065
Looking like this?

122
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:03,150
Like... What?

123
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,696
Blue?

124
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:13,327
- You're my oldest friend.
- I'm your only friend.

125
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,580
- Thank you for that.
- Well?

126
00:13:16,622 --> 00:13:18,916
I'm incapable of thinking of you that way.

127
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,167
I feel responsible for you.

128
00:13:20,835 --> 00:13:24,004
Anything else would just feel wrong.

129
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:26,590
- But what if you didn't know me?
- Unfortunately, I do know you.

130
00:13:26,674 --> 00:13:28,092
I don't know what's gotten into you lately.

131
00:13:28,134 --> 00:13:29,927
You're awfully concerned with your looks.

132
00:13:34,765 --> 00:13:36,433
I'm sleepy. Will you read to me?

133
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:38,811
I can't. I have my thesis coming up.
I have to study.

134
00:13:38,894 --> 00:13:41,772
Fine, read that.
Your thesis always sends me right off.

135
00:13:42,314 --> 00:13:46,277
"To Homo neanderthalensis,
his mutant cousin, Homo sapiens,

136
00:13:46,318 --> 00:13:47,444
"was an aberration.

137

139

141

<i>"of their less-evolved kin."</i>

142
00:14:08,257 --> 00:14:11,635
<font color="#ffff00">Possession of that gold is illegal.</font>

143
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:13,637
<font color="#ffff00">I should inform the police.</font>

144

145
00:14:15,764 --> 00:14:17,474
<font color="#ffff00">Where did you get it?</font>

146
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:19,435
<font color="#ffff00">A friend.</font>

147
00:14:19,727 --> 00:14:22,188
<font color="#ffff00">He recommended your bank most highly.</font>

148
00:14:24,148 --> 00:14:25,149
<font color="#ffff00">I see.</font>

149
00:14:25,274 --> 00:14:27,651
<font color="#ffff00">Do you know our terms, sir?</font>

150
00:14:28,194 --> 00:14:29,236
<font color="#ffff00">Yes.</font>

151
00:14:30,863 --> 00:14:33,157
<font color="#ffff00">And you should know mine.</font>

152
00:14:35,618 --> 00:14:38,454
<font color="#ffff00">This gold is what remains of my people.</font>

155
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,002
<font color="#ffff00">This is blood money.</font>

156
00:14:45,377 --> 00:14:48,172
<font color="#ffff00">And you're going to help me find
the bastards responsible for it.</font>

157
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:55,304
<font color="#ffff00">Don't touch that alarm.</font>

158
00:14:58,057 --> 00:15:02,019
<font color="#ffff00">I want Schmidt. Klaus Schmidt.</font>

159
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:03,187
<font color="#ffff00">Where is he?</font>

160
00:15:03,687 --> 00:15:05,898
<font color="#ffff00">Our clients don't provide addresses.
We're not...</font>

161
00:15:05,981 --> 00:15:08,442
<font color="#ffff00">Not that sort of bank?</font>

162
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:17,868
<font color="#ffff00">Metal fillings, eh?</font>

163
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,911
<font color="#ffff00">Not gold.</font>

164
00:15:18,994 --> 00:15:20,454
<font color="#ffff00">Worried someone might steal them?</font>

165
00:15:20,537 --> 00:15:23,749
<font color="#ffff00">Argentina! Schmidt is in Argentina!</font>

166
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:28,963
<font color="#ffff00">Villa Gesell! Please!</font>

167
00:15:45,229 --> 00:15:46,230
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you.</font>

168
00:15:50,693 --> 00:15:53,112
<font color="#ffff00">I would love to kill you.</font>

169
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:59,410
<font color="#ffff00">So mark my words.</font>

170
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:04,039
<font color="#ffff00">If you warn anyone I'm coming...</font>

171
00:16:04,081 --> 00:16:05,749
<font color="#ffff00">I will find you.</font>

172
00:16:18,262 --> 00:16:20,639
Another day at the office.

173
00:16:20,723 --> 00:16:22,474
Is that Colonel Hendry?

174
00:16:22,558 --> 00:16:23,934
The NATO guy?

175
00:16:23,976 --> 00:16:25,436
Yeah.

176
00:16:26,103 --> 00:16:27,771
Yes, it is.

177
00:16:27,855 --> 00:16:30,274
Because that's three mob bosses,
the Italian ambassador

178
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:32,276
and the CEO of Lockheed.

179
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:34,278
They can't all be Communists.

180
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,780
This Hellfire Club,
it's got to be something else.

181
00:16:38,282 --> 00:16:40,826
Do you see that?

182
00:16:40,951 --> 00:16:43,037
Hello, girls.

183
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,122
Wow! Very nice.

184
00:16:46,665 --> 00:16:48,208
What are you doing?

185
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:52,046
Using some equipment the CIA
didn't give me. Stay put.

186
00:16:55,257 --> 00:16:57,134
- Colonel Hendry?
- Yes, ma'am.

187
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,304
Emma Frost. Sebastian Shaw's associate.

188
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,640
And where is Mr. Shaw?

189
00:17:03,766 --> 00:17:07,144
We're having a party,
and here's the entertainment.

190
00:17:07,186 --> 00:17:08,812
Come with me.

191
00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:48,936
Hello, beautiful. How are you?

192
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:51,688
Hey, baby. You want to find a quiet place?

193
00:17:51,814 --> 00:17:55,901
I am so sorry.
I've been booked by Colonel Hendry.

194
00:17:57,152 --> 00:17:58,695
Excuse me.

195
00:18:19,091 --> 00:18:21,427
You sure we can't get you a refill, Bob?

196
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,886
No.

197
00:18:22,928 --> 00:18:27,933
So, I hear you blocked the proposal
to position Jupiter missiles in Turkey.

198
00:18:30,144 --> 00:18:32,146
I expect you'll reconsider.

199
00:18:32,229 --> 00:18:33,939
We've had this conversation.

200
00:18:34,356 --> 00:18:38,193
You put our nukes in Turkey
or anywhere that close to Russia,

201
00:18:38,235 --> 00:18:40,070
and you're looking at war.

202
00:18:40,154 --> 00:18:41,655
Nuclear war.

203
00:19:14,605 --> 00:19:16,273
I don't ask for favors, Colonel.

204
00:19:16,565 --> 00:19:19,026
I express my expectations.

205
00:19:19,234 --> 00:19:22,613
So, let me say it again.

206
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:25,866
I expect you'll reconsider.

207
00:19:26,575 --> 00:19:28,911
The only thing I will reconsider

208
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:32,206
is having another glass
of that delicious champagne.

209
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:47,804
What the hell did you put in my drink?

210
00:20:05,155 --> 00:20:08,075
<i>You're thinking of running. Hiding.</i>

211
00:20:08,158 --> 00:20:10,077
<i>We'd find you, Hendry.</i>

212
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,996
<i>There's not a fortress in the world
that could keep us out.</i>

213
00:20:29,805 --> 00:20:32,683
Magnificent. Isn't she, Bob?

214
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:37,938
Genetic mutation.
The evolution of the human genome.

215
00:20:38,021 --> 00:20:39,481
Where's Azazel?

216
00:20:45,737 --> 00:20:47,197
We don't want the Colonel to be late.

217
00:20:51,326 --> 00:20:52,327
Comrade.

218
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,041
Missiles in Turkey send
a very clear message.

219
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,293
If we ever decide to fire them,

220
00:20:59,376 --> 00:21:02,087
the Russian early-warning system
won't even have time to kick in.

221
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,880
This better be important, MacTaggert.

222
00:21:03,964 --> 00:21:06,300
Whoa, slow down.

223
00:21:06,383 --> 00:21:08,719
Are you smoking them funny cigarettes?
People don't disappear.

224
00:21:08,802 --> 00:21:10,095
Colonel Hendry was there.

225
00:21:10,178 --> 00:21:12,014
He was there, McCone, in the Hellfire Club.

226
00:21:12,306 --> 00:21:13,599
Colonel Hendry?

227
00:21:13,682 --> 00:21:15,726
I agree with you, General.

228
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:17,269
I've reconsidered my position

229
00:21:17,352 --> 00:21:20,731
and I now believe we should put
Jupiter missiles in Turkey.

230
00:21:20,856 --> 00:21:22,024
Colonel Hendry is here.

231
00:21:22,065 --> 00:21:25,402
So unless he magically traveled
3,000 miles in the last 10 minutes,

232
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:28,989
listen to me, I suggest
that you stop wasting my time.

233
00:21:29,072 --> 00:21:31,366
Looks like Hendry wants
to start World War III.

234
00:21:31,408 --> 00:21:33,910
I got bigger things to deal with
right now, MacTaggert.

235
00:21:34,036 --> 00:21:35,495
Sir, I...

236
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:37,748
- God!
- Have you lost your mind?

237
00:21:38,415 --> 00:21:40,042
So, now what?

238
00:21:42,085 --> 00:21:44,713
We find an expert on genetic mutation.

239
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:49,968
<i>Professor of Genetics,
Charles Francis Xavier.</i>

240
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,723
So, how does it feel to be a professor?

241
00:21:54,765 --> 00:21:56,767
Don't call me that.
You don't get to be called a professor

242
00:21:56,808 --> 00:21:58,435
until you actually have a teaching position.

243
00:21:58,518 --> 00:21:59,603
I know, but it suits you.

244
00:21:59,645 --> 00:22:01,355
Don't say that. Do say,
"Let's go have a drink."

245
00:22:01,438 --> 00:22:03,690
- Let's go have a drink.
- Wonderful.

246
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,429
<font color="#ffff00">Afternoon, gentlemen.</font>

247
00:22:34,513 --> 00:22:35,514
<font color="#ffff00">Hot out there.</font>

248
00:22:35,889 --> 00:22:37,641
<font color="#ffff00">Beer, please.</font>

249
00:23:01,456 --> 00:23:03,375
<font color="#ffff00">- German beer.
- Of course.</font>

250
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,587
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, it's Bitburger. You like it?</font>

251
00:23:14,052 --> 00:23:15,721
<font color="#ffff00">The best.</font>

252
00:23:20,642 --> 00:23:23,437
<font color="#ffff00">What brings you to Argentina?</font>

253
00:23:24,896 --> 00:23:28,525
<font color="#ffff00">The climate. I'm a pig farmer.</font>

254
00:23:32,529 --> 00:23:35,532
<font color="#ffff00">Tailor. Since I was a boy.</font>

255
00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:38,160
<font color="#ffff00">My father made the finest
suits in Dusseldorf.</font>

256
00:23:39,494 --> 00:23:42,205
<font color="#ffff00">My parents were from Dusseldorf.</font>

257
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,791
<font color="#ffff00">What was their name?</font>

258
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:46,626
<font color="#ffff00">They didn't have a name.</font>

259
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:50,505
<font color="#ffff00">It was taken away from them...</font>

260
00:23:50,547 --> 00:23:52,090
<font color="#ffff00">by pig farmers...</font>

261
00:23:53,592 --> 00:23:54,634
<font color="#ffff00">...and tailors.</font>

262
00:24:23,914 --> 00:24:25,582
<font color="#ffff00">Blood and Honor.</font>

263
00:24:26,082 --> 00:24:27,751
<font color="#ffff00">Which would you care to shed first?</font>

264
00:24:27,876 --> 00:24:29,753
<font color="#ffff00">We were under orders...</font>

265
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,921
<font color="#ffff00">Blood then.</font>

266
00:24:33,632 --> 00:24:34,633
<font color="#ffff00">Freeze, asshole.</font>

267
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,259
<font color="#ffff00">Come on, shoot.</font>

268
00:24:56,947 --> 00:24:58,949
<font color="#ffff00">Who... what are you?</font>

269
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:05,121
Let's just say I'm Frankenstein's monster.

270
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,844
And I'm looking for my creator.

271
00:25:23,181 --> 00:25:25,642
Drink! Drink! Drink!

272
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,610
Yeah!

273
00:25:41,324 --> 00:25:44,077
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

274
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,330
I need another drink.
And you need another cola.

275
00:25:51,001 --> 00:25:53,003
- Congratulations, Professor.
- Thank you very much.

276
00:25:53,086 --> 00:25:54,671
It's much harder than it looks, actually.

277
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:56,006
No, on your presentation.

278
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:58,550
You were at my presentation?
How nice of you. Thank you very much.

279
00:25:58,675 --> 00:25:59,718
Moira MacTaggert.

280
00:25:59,843 --> 00:26:01,845
- Charles Xavier.
- Do you have a minute?

281
00:26:01,928 --> 00:26:05,056
For a pretty little bean
with a mutated MCR1 gene?

282
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,683
I have five.

283
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:11,605
I say "MCR1," you would say "Auburn hair."

284
00:26:11,688 --> 00:26:13,023
It's a mutation.

285
00:26:13,231 --> 00:26:14,816
It's a very groovy mutation.

286
00:26:15,317 --> 00:26:17,152
Mutation, right,

287
00:26:17,193 --> 00:26:21,364
took us from single-celled
organisms to the dominant form...

288
00:26:21,406 --> 00:26:24,159
You know what? This routine may
go over great with the co-eds,

289
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,828
- but I'm here on business.
- What?

290
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,457
- I really need your help.
- All right.

291
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:34,044
The kind of mutations that you
were talking about in your thesis.

292
00:26:34,085 --> 00:26:36,129
I need to know if they may
have already happened.

293
00:26:37,714 --> 00:26:39,174
In people alive today.

294
00:26:51,144 --> 00:26:52,979
Professor?

295
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:56,316
I think we should just
talk when you're sober.

296
00:26:56,399 --> 00:26:57,484
Do you have any time tomorrow?

297
00:26:59,402 --> 00:27:02,614
Something tells me you already
know the answer to your question.

298
00:27:05,283 --> 00:27:09,537
This is very important to me, and if
I can help you, I will do my utmost.

299
00:27:09,746 --> 00:27:10,747
Thank you.

300
00:27:14,417 --> 00:27:16,628
Still drinking champagne, Bob?

301
00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:18,672
I will pass.

302
00:27:18,755 --> 00:27:21,675
Okay, well, so much for the pleasantries.

303
00:27:22,425 --> 00:27:25,637
I was wondering who you told
about our little arrangement.

304
00:27:25,887 --> 00:27:27,097
No one.

305
00:27:29,891 --> 00:27:32,102
- He's telling the truth.
- Good.

306
00:27:32,268 --> 00:27:34,437
Well, I guess we're done here.

307
00:27:34,479 --> 00:27:36,022
Let's wrap things up, shall we?

308
00:27:40,443 --> 00:27:42,904
I knew better than to trust you.

309
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:47,492
Now, you let me walk out
of here with my money,

310
00:27:47,575 --> 00:27:51,663
or I will pull this pin, and we all die.

311
00:27:52,205 --> 00:27:55,125
Go ahead. Pull it.

312
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:57,085
I'll do it, I swear to God.

313
00:28:06,678 --> 00:28:08,138
No, you won't.

314
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:14,019
But I will.

315
00:28:27,991 --> 00:28:29,284
You're one of them?

316
00:28:29,325 --> 00:28:31,119
Very astute of you, Colonel Hendry.

317
00:28:31,494 --> 00:28:33,038
You want to guess what I can do?

318
00:28:33,204 --> 00:28:36,124
I've got the power to absorb energy.
It keeps me young.

319
00:28:36,499 --> 00:28:37,917
But that's the boring part.

320
00:28:38,168 --> 00:28:41,755
The fun stuff is what I can do
with it once I've got it.

321
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:51,681
The advent of the nuclear age may have
accelerated the mutation process.

322
00:28:52,015 --> 00:28:57,395
Individuals with extraordinary
abilities may already be among us.

323
00:28:57,479 --> 00:28:58,521
Thank you very much.

324
00:28:58,605 --> 00:29:01,191
MacTaggert, you really think
that some crackpot scientist

325
00:29:01,232 --> 00:29:05,195
is going to make me believe
in sparkly dames and vanishing men?

326
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:08,364
You just bought yourself a one-way
ticket back to the typing pool.

327
00:29:08,448 --> 00:29:09,866
This meeting is over.

328
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:13,411
Please sit down, Agent MacTaggert.

329
00:29:13,495 --> 00:29:15,455
I didn't really expect you to believe me,

330
00:29:15,538 --> 00:29:17,707
given that all you could think about
during my presentation was

331
00:29:17,749 --> 00:29:21,169
what sort of pie they were
serving in the commissary.

332
00:29:21,211 --> 00:29:23,213
It's apple pecan.

333
00:29:23,296 --> 00:29:25,715
I haven't been entirely honest
with you, love. I'm sorry.

334
00:29:25,757 --> 00:29:28,051
You see, one of the many spectacular things

335
00:29:28,093 --> 00:29:32,388
my mutation allows me to do
is that I can read your mind.

336
00:29:32,847 --> 00:29:35,141
I've seen this before in a magic show.

337
00:29:35,225 --> 00:29:39,187
Are you going to ask us to think
of a number between one and 10 now?

338
00:29:39,229 --> 00:29:40,980
No, Agent Stryker. Although,

339
00:29:41,064 --> 00:29:43,108
I could ask you about your son, William,

340
00:29:43,191 --> 00:29:44,818
who you were thinking about,
which is very nice.

341
00:29:44,901 --> 00:29:47,612
But I think I'd rather ask you
about the Jupiter missiles

342
00:29:47,695 --> 00:29:49,781
America are currently placing in Turkey.

343
00:29:51,866 --> 00:29:53,034
He's a goddamn spy.

344
00:29:53,076 --> 00:29:55,787
You brought a goddamned
spy into this facility!

345
00:30:15,598 --> 00:30:17,267
How's that for a magic trick?

346
00:30:20,353 --> 00:30:22,564
Best I've ever seen.

347
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:25,191
I want them out of here.

348
00:30:25,275 --> 00:30:28,111
And locked down until I can
figure out what to do.

349
00:30:28,945 --> 00:30:30,363
My facility is off-site.

350
00:30:32,115 --> 00:30:33,616
I'll take them.

351
00:30:34,868 --> 00:30:36,911
I can't believe this.
You'd think the director of the CIA

352
00:30:36,953 --> 00:30:38,121
would have a little more composure.

353
00:30:38,163 --> 00:30:39,581
We should be going after Shaw right now.

354
00:30:39,622 --> 00:30:42,083
But instead, he's out there worrying
about the wrong mutants.

355
00:30:42,167 --> 00:30:43,710
What are we going to do, Levene?

356
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,754
Levene? Levene, what's wrong with you?

357
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:50,550
<i>Absolutely nothing.</i>

358
00:30:50,633 --> 00:30:52,969
<i>I've just frozen him for a moment
because I'd like to talk to you.</i>

359
00:30:53,011 --> 00:30:54,387
<i>It's good, isn't it?</i>

360
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:57,056
<i>I'm as interested in this
Sebastian Shaw as you are.</i>

361
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,977
<i>If you still want my help, meet me
on the third floor of the parking garage.</i>

362
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:04,189
I've always known that there
were people like you out there.

363
00:31:04,272 --> 00:31:07,817
I've been the laughing stock of this
agency for years, but I knew it!

364
00:31:07,859 --> 00:31:08,860
You are going to love my facility.

365
00:31:08,943 --> 00:31:10,945
- That's going to have to wait.
- Why?

366
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:12,906
Agent MacTaggert has
a lead on Sebastian Shaw,

367
00:31:12,989 --> 00:31:15,408
and if we don't move now,
apparently, we're going to lose him.

368
00:31:15,491 --> 00:31:17,827
- What?
- Not only can he read minds,

369
00:31:17,911 --> 00:31:19,412
he can communicate with them as well.

370
00:31:19,495 --> 00:31:21,331
Moira and I have just had
a lovely conversation.

371
00:31:21,414 --> 00:31:22,665
Yes, we did.

372
00:31:22,749 --> 00:31:24,250
That is incredible!

373
00:31:25,043 --> 00:31:28,087
But I cannot take you anywhere else
without permission from upstairs.

374
00:31:28,171 --> 00:31:30,173
- Like to see one more magic trick?
- Okay.

375
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:32,675
- Get in the car.
- Good idea.

376
00:31:53,196 --> 00:31:54,405
<i>Herr Doktor.</i>

377
00:31:58,826 --> 00:32:00,912
<font color="#ffff00">Little Erik Lensherr.</font>

378
00:32:01,371 --> 00:32:03,039
He's here to kill you.

379
00:32:09,796 --> 00:32:12,632
<font color="#ffff00">What kind of a greeting is that...</font>

380
00:32:15,093 --> 00:32:16,636
<font color="#ffff00">...after all these years?</font>

381
00:32:26,229 --> 00:32:28,314
Emma.

382
00:32:28,982 --> 00:32:30,566
We don't harm our own kind.

383
00:32:32,443 --> 00:32:34,737
Now it's a party.

384
00:32:36,072 --> 00:32:38,408
<i>This is the US Coast Guard.</i>

385
00:32:38,449 --> 00:32:42,495
<i>Do not attempt to move your vessel.
Stay where you are.</i>

386
00:32:48,835 --> 00:32:50,670
They have a telepath.

387
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:59,262
I've lost Shaw. I've lost Shaw.
There's something blocking me.

388
00:32:59,304 --> 00:33:00,430
This has never happened to me before.

389
00:33:00,471 --> 00:33:02,765
I think there's someone like me
on that ship.

390
00:33:02,849 --> 00:33:05,435
- Like you?
- I'm sorry, a telepath.

391
00:33:05,518 --> 00:33:08,396
This is incredible. I could actually feel
her inside my mind. I'm very sorry,

392
00:33:08,438 --> 00:33:10,815
but I don't think I'm gonna be much
help tonight. You're on your own.

393
00:33:24,996 --> 00:33:26,289
- Oh, my God!
- Jesus!

394
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:31,586
Get inside.

395
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:38,426
Stop, stop, stop.

396
00:33:39,844 --> 00:33:42,263
Charles! Are you okay?

397
00:33:42,305 --> 00:33:43,473
There's someone else out there.

398
00:33:47,518 --> 00:33:48,603
There.

399
00:33:52,065 --> 00:33:53,149
Time to go.

400
00:34:47,995 --> 00:34:49,455
Let go!

401
00:34:51,541 --> 00:34:52,708
You have to let it go!

402
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:54,710
You've got to put someone
in the water to help him.

403
00:34:54,836 --> 00:34:57,964
Let it go! You have to let it go!

404
00:35:18,234 --> 00:35:21,737
<i>You can't. You'll drown.
You have to let go.</i>

405
00:35:21,821 --> 00:35:24,907
<i>I know what this means to you,
but you're going to die.</i>

406
00:35:24,949 --> 00:35:29,078
<i>Please, Erik, calm your mind.</i>

407
00:35:40,631 --> 00:35:42,258
Get off me! Get off!

408
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,594
Calm down! Just breathe. We're here!

409
00:35:44,635 --> 00:35:46,762
- Who are you?
- My name is Charles Xavier.

410
00:35:47,597 --> 00:35:49,807
You were in my head.
How did you do that?

411
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:54,187
You have your tricks, I have mine.
I'm like you. Just calm your mind.

412
00:35:56,606 --> 00:35:57,857
I thought I was alone.

413
00:35:59,192 --> 00:36:00,651
You're not alone.

414
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:04,864
Erik, you're not alone.

415
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:28,137
Welcome to my facility.

416
00:36:28,221 --> 00:36:29,889
My mission has been to investigate

417
00:36:29,972 --> 00:36:33,059
the application of paranormal
powers in military defense.

418
00:36:33,351 --> 00:36:35,061
Or offense.

419
00:36:35,144 --> 00:36:37,355
This guy Shaw, Schmidt,

420
00:36:37,438 --> 00:36:40,149
whatever you want to call him,
he's working with the Russians.

421
00:36:40,191 --> 00:36:42,568
- We might need your help to stop him.
- Marvelous.

422
00:36:42,652 --> 00:36:45,613
So we're to be the CIA's
new mutant division, yes?

423
00:36:46,739 --> 00:36:47,907
Something like that.

424
00:36:51,327 --> 00:36:55,581
It's a supersonic.
The most advanced plane ever built.

425
00:36:56,999 --> 00:37:00,127
You should see it in real life. It's incredible.

426
00:37:00,169 --> 00:37:04,131
Hank, these are the special new
recruits I was telling you about.

427
00:37:04,173 --> 00:37:07,176
This is Hank McCoy, one of our
most talented young researchers.

428
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,930
How wonderful.
Another mutant, already here.

429
00:37:11,013 --> 00:37:13,057
Why didn't you say?

430
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,267
Say what?

431
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:17,687
Because you don't know.

432
00:37:17,728 --> 00:37:21,023
I am so, so terribly sorry.

433
00:37:23,818 --> 00:37:27,321
- Hank?
- You didn't ask, so I didn't tell.

434
00:37:27,363 --> 00:37:29,031
So, your mutation is what?

435
00:37:29,073 --> 00:37:31,784
- You're super-smart?
- I'll say.

436
00:37:31,867 --> 00:37:33,744
Hank here graduated
Harvard at the age of 15.

437
00:37:34,996 --> 00:37:37,081
I wish that's all it was.

438
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,041
You're among friends now, Hank.

439
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:40,543
You can show off.

440
00:37:56,726 --> 00:37:57,852
Splendid.

441
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:06,110
I'm sorry.

442
00:38:11,949 --> 00:38:13,451
Ta-da!

443
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,584
You're amazing.

444
00:38:22,418 --> 00:38:23,502
Really?

445
00:38:28,966 --> 00:38:30,593
<i>"The presence of US missiles in Turkey</i>

446
00:38:30,676 --> 00:38:34,221
<i>"represents an unprecedented threat
to the people of the Soviet Union,"</i>

447
00:38:34,305 --> 00:38:37,683
<i>warned Russian Foreign Minister
Gromyko earlier today.</i>

448
00:38:38,184 --> 00:38:41,270
<i>But he was quick to insist
the Russians would not be the first</i>

449
00:38:41,312 --> 00:38:43,564
<i>to initiate any military action.</i>

450
00:38:43,606 --> 00:38:46,442
Yeah, we'll fix that as soon
as we get to Russia.

451
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:49,111
Unless the CIA find us first.

452
00:38:49,153 --> 00:38:51,322
I'll take care of them, too.

453
00:38:52,448 --> 00:38:57,286
If that telepath gets inside your head,
he won't be as much fun as I am.

454
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,246
Already in hand, my love.

455
00:39:08,964 --> 00:39:10,841
The Russians

456
00:39:12,802 --> 00:39:15,137
made me this.

457
00:39:17,765 --> 00:39:20,351
So, what am I thinking?

458
00:39:29,777 --> 00:39:31,195
I don't know.

459
00:39:34,156 --> 00:39:36,075
I was thinking that you are
the most exquisite thing

460
00:39:36,158 --> 00:39:37,785
I have ever seen in my life.

461
00:39:41,997 --> 00:39:43,958
And that this needs ice.

462
00:39:45,459 --> 00:39:47,211
Fetch me some.

463
00:39:47,294 --> 00:39:48,587
There's a good girl.

464
00:40:13,904 --> 00:40:18,075
I promised myself I'd find a cure
ever since I was a little boy.

465
00:40:18,534 --> 00:40:22,580
You have no idea what I'd give to feel

466
00:40:22,663 --> 00:40:24,248
- normal.
- Normal.

467
00:40:29,003 --> 00:40:31,464
Charles has never understood.

468
00:40:31,547 --> 00:40:34,383
He's different, but he's never had to hide.

469
00:40:35,551 --> 00:40:39,722
Hank, this serum that you're making,
it doesn't affect abilities, right?

470
00:40:39,764 --> 00:40:42,725
Just appearance. It normalizes it.

471
00:40:42,808 --> 00:40:43,893
Yeah.

472
00:40:44,727 --> 00:40:46,395
Do you think it would work on me?

473
00:40:47,897 --> 00:40:50,941
I can look into it, if you'd like.
It's the least I can do

474
00:40:51,025 --> 00:40:53,235
after asking you to come down here
with such a weird request.

475
00:40:54,069 --> 00:40:57,239
I have to admit, usually when guys
ask me out, they're not after my blood.

476
00:40:58,032 --> 00:41:01,869
Sorry. I didn't intend to be forward.
I was just...

477
00:41:02,495 --> 00:41:06,165
I was excited.
You know, the nature of your mutation.

478
00:41:06,248 --> 00:41:09,335
If any genes hold the key
to changing appearance, it's yours.

479
00:41:09,627 --> 00:41:13,714
Hank, you weren't being forward.
That's kind of what I meant.

480
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:15,800
No.

481
00:41:15,883 --> 00:41:17,927
But I'm just sorry if you thought I was.

482
00:41:18,219 --> 00:41:20,346
And I'm sorry that you weren't.

483
00:41:21,555 --> 00:41:24,016
Go ahead. Take the blood.

484
00:41:35,778 --> 00:41:37,279
Sorry. Did I hurt you?

485
00:41:40,115 --> 00:41:41,575
Kinky.

486
00:41:43,452 --> 00:41:47,414
By the way, if I looked like you,

487
00:41:47,498 --> 00:41:49,083
I wouldn't change a thing.

488
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,403
From what I know about you,

489
00:42:17,486 --> 00:42:19,822
I'm surprised you've managed
to stay this long.

490
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:22,825
What do you know about me?

491
00:42:23,868 --> 00:42:25,077
Everything.

492
00:42:25,286 --> 00:42:26,829
Then you know to stay out of my head.

493
00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:30,958
I'm sorry, Erik, but I've seen
what Shaw did to you.

494
00:42:32,501 --> 00:42:35,087
I've felt your agony.

495
00:42:36,755 --> 00:42:38,549
I can help you.

496
00:42:45,556 --> 00:42:46,765
I don't need your help.

497
00:42:46,849 --> 00:42:49,018
Don't kid yourself.
You needed my help last night.

498
00:42:49,101 --> 00:42:51,604
It's not just me you're walking away from.

499
00:42:52,354 --> 00:42:56,525
Here you have the chance to be part
of something much bigger than yourself.

500
00:42:58,903 --> 00:43:01,697
I won't stop you leaving. I could.

501
00:43:05,034 --> 00:43:06,535
But I won't.

502
00:43:10,497 --> 00:43:11,624
Shaw has got friends.

503
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:14,793
You could do with some.

504
00:43:20,633 --> 00:43:23,594
Hank turned that radar
installation into a transmitter.

505
00:43:23,677 --> 00:43:26,221
It's designed to amplify brainwaves

506
00:43:26,263 --> 00:43:28,641
so it could enhance your telepathic powers,

507
00:43:28,724 --> 00:43:30,851
help us find other mutants for our division.

508
00:43:30,893 --> 00:43:32,978
What if they don't want to be found by you?

509
00:43:33,062 --> 00:43:34,563
Erik.

510
00:43:34,939 --> 00:43:36,065
You decided to stay.

511
00:43:39,109 --> 00:43:43,238
If a new species is being discovered,
it should be by its own kind.

512
00:43:43,322 --> 00:43:45,783
Charles and I find the mutants. No suits.

513
00:43:46,075 --> 00:43:47,743
First of all, that's my machine out there.

514
00:43:47,785 --> 00:43:50,746
Second of all, and much more
importantly, this is Charles' decision.

515
00:43:50,788 --> 00:43:52,665
Charles is fine with the CIA being involved.

516
00:43:52,748 --> 00:43:54,249
Isn't that right?

517
00:43:55,751 --> 00:43:59,046
No. I'm sorry, but I'm with Erik.

518
00:44:00,339 --> 00:44:02,257
We'll find them alone.

519
00:44:03,509 --> 00:44:04,760
What if I say no?

520
00:44:06,136 --> 00:44:09,223
Then good luck using your installation
without me.

521
00:44:21,402 --> 00:44:24,947
I call it Cerebro.

522
00:44:25,072 --> 00:44:27,992
- As in the Spanish for "brain."
- Yes.

523
00:44:28,075 --> 00:44:31,453
Okay, so, the electrodes connect Charles
to the transmitter on the roof.

524
00:44:31,537 --> 00:44:35,624
When he picks up a mutant,
his brain sends a signal through a relay

525
00:44:35,666 --> 00:44:38,794
and then the co-ordinates
of their location are printed out here.

526
00:44:38,877 --> 00:44:41,255
- You designed this?
- Yeah.

527
00:44:44,717 --> 00:44:46,343
What an adorable lab rat you make, Charles.

528
00:44:46,427 --> 00:44:48,512
Don't spoil this for me, Erik.

529
00:44:48,595 --> 00:44:51,015
I've been a lab rat.
I know one when I see one.

530
00:44:51,265 --> 00:44:55,185
Okay, great.
Are you sure we can't shave your head?

531
00:44:55,269 --> 00:44:57,354
- Don't touch my hair.
- Okay.

532
00:45:41,023 --> 00:45:42,149
It's working!

533
00:46:00,542 --> 00:46:03,545
For that, daddy-o, you get a private dance.

534
00:46:07,049 --> 00:46:09,426
You cats know it's double for both, right?

535
00:46:10,385 --> 00:46:12,387
No, that won't be necessary.
Although, I'm sure it'd be magical.

536
00:46:12,429 --> 00:46:15,891
We were thinking more, we'll show you ours

537
00:46:15,974 --> 00:46:17,267
if you show us yours.

538
00:46:17,392 --> 00:46:19,728
Baby, that is not the way
it works around here.

539
00:46:21,814 --> 00:46:23,190
More tea, vicar?

540
00:46:23,565 --> 00:46:25,609
Don't mind if I do.

541
00:46:27,945 --> 00:46:29,738
My turn.

542
00:46:47,256 --> 00:46:49,925
How would you like a job where
you get to keep your clothes on?

543
00:46:55,597 --> 00:46:57,766
- Where to, fellas?
- Richmond, Virginia, please.

544
00:46:57,850 --> 00:47:00,769
Right, so, you want the airport?
The station? What?

545
00:47:00,811 --> 00:47:04,022
No, we were rather hoping you
would take us all the way.

546
00:47:04,273 --> 00:47:05,607
That's a six-hour drive.

547
00:47:05,649 --> 00:47:08,068
That will give us plenty of time to talk.

548
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:14,616
What does the government want
with a guy like Alex Summers?

549
00:47:15,033 --> 00:47:16,743
I hope you're not planning
on putting him with others.

550
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:21,623
First guy I've ever met who actually
prefers solitary confinement.

551
00:47:30,924 --> 00:47:32,384
Crazy, huh?

552
00:47:32,467 --> 00:47:33,635
What?

553
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:35,679
You like fish. I like fish, too.

554
00:47:36,305 --> 00:47:39,641
Maybe we should get a bite
sometime, talk about it?

555
00:47:41,727 --> 00:47:43,395
I'd rather go out with the fish.

556
00:47:49,735 --> 00:47:51,486
These fish?

557
00:48:10,422 --> 00:48:12,507
- Excuse me, I'm Erik Lensherr.
- Charles Xavier.

558
00:48:12,591 --> 00:48:14,509
Go fuck yourself.

559
00:48:34,363 --> 00:48:36,406
- There's nothing on radar?
- Nothing.

560
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:38,450
- Sonar?
- <i>Nyet.</i>

561
00:48:39,368 --> 00:48:41,411
Then we have a problem.

562
00:49:00,055 --> 00:49:02,641
Beautiful, isn't it?

563
00:49:02,724 --> 00:49:04,851
The reason we exist.

564
00:49:04,893 --> 00:49:07,062
We are the children of the atom, my love.

565
00:49:07,396 --> 00:49:08,563
We have a situation.

566
00:49:09,439 --> 00:49:10,857
The telepath.

567
00:49:10,899 --> 00:49:13,110
I shouldn't be able to feel
him at this distance.

568
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:15,612
It's like his reach is

569
00:49:15,696 --> 00:49:16,780
amplified.

570
00:49:20,117 --> 00:49:22,244
They're recruiting.

571
00:49:22,327 --> 00:49:25,998
You go on to Russia. I'll handle them.

572
00:49:27,666 --> 00:49:29,918
I can't stop thinking about
the others out there.

573
00:49:30,002 --> 00:49:33,797
All those minds that I touched.
I could feel them.

574
00:49:34,756 --> 00:49:39,261
Their isolation, their hopes,
their ambitions.

575
00:49:39,303 --> 00:49:41,722
I tell you, we are at the start
of something incredible, Erik.

576
00:49:41,763 --> 00:49:42,973
We can help them.

577
00:49:43,473 --> 00:49:44,766
Can we?

578
00:49:46,059 --> 00:49:49,229
Identification, that's how it starts.

579
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,067
And ends with being rounded up,
experimented on, eliminated.

580
00:49:54,109 --> 00:49:55,944
Not this time.

581
00:49:55,986 --> 00:49:58,280
We have common enemies.
Shaw, the Russians.

582
00:49:58,322 --> 00:49:59,906
They need us.

583
00:49:59,948 --> 00:50:01,450
For now.

584
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,415
We should think of code names.

585
00:50:08,665 --> 00:50:10,834
We're government agents now,
we should have secret code names.

586
00:50:11,251 --> 00:50:12,377
I want to be called Mystique.

587
00:50:12,753 --> 00:50:15,297
Damn! I wanted to be called Mystique.

588
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,299
Well, tough. I called it.

589
00:50:18,884 --> 00:50:21,595
And I'm way more mysterious than you.

590
00:50:24,139 --> 00:50:25,390
Darwin, what about you?

591
00:50:25,724 --> 00:50:27,684
Well, "Darwin" is already a nickname,

592
00:50:27,768 --> 00:50:30,312
and, you know, it sort of fits.

593
00:50:30,395 --> 00:50:31,772
Adapt to survive and all.

594
00:50:32,356 --> 00:50:34,441
Check this out.

595
00:50:47,454 --> 00:50:49,164
- That was incredible.
- Thank you.

596
00:50:49,748 --> 00:50:53,710
- What about you?
- I'm going to be

597
00:50:53,794 --> 00:50:54,836
Banshee.

598
00:50:54,878 --> 00:50:56,671
Why do you want to be named
after a wailing spirit?

599
00:50:56,797 --> 00:50:58,090
You might want to cover your ears.

600
00:51:14,398 --> 00:51:17,859
- Your turn.
- My stage name is Angel.

601
00:51:19,111 --> 00:51:21,196
- It kind of fits.
- You can fly?

602
00:51:22,197 --> 00:51:23,198
And...

603
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:33,291
What's your name?

604
00:51:34,626 --> 00:51:35,710
How about Big Foot?

605
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:39,214
You know what they say
about guys with big feet.

606
00:51:39,256 --> 00:51:41,216
And yours are kind of small.

607
00:51:41,341 --> 00:51:42,634
Okay, now.

608
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:45,887
Alex, what is your gift?
What can you do?

609
00:51:46,054 --> 00:51:48,723
It's not...

610
00:51:48,765 --> 00:51:51,059
I just can't do it.
I can't do it in here.

611
00:51:51,101 --> 00:51:53,395
- Can you do it out there?
- Why don't you just do it out there?

612
00:51:53,437 --> 00:51:57,065
- Come on!
- Alex! Alex! Alex!

613
00:52:01,987 --> 00:52:03,488
That's the spirit!

614
00:52:03,572 --> 00:52:05,657
Get down when I tell you.

615
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,576
"Get down when I tell you."

616
00:52:12,497 --> 00:52:13,582
Get back.

617
00:52:19,087 --> 00:52:20,130
Get back!

618
00:52:21,756 --> 00:52:23,425
Whatever.

619
00:52:37,063 --> 00:52:41,234
We have intel that Shaw is meeting
with the Russian Defense Chief in Moscow.

620
00:52:41,276 --> 00:52:43,445
So go ahead. Say it.

621
00:52:43,487 --> 00:52:45,947
I'm not here to say "I told you so."
You know why I'm here.

622
00:52:45,989 --> 00:52:48,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Clearance to bring along your mutants.

623
00:52:48,783 --> 00:52:52,245
Fight fire with fire. It makes sense.

624
00:52:52,287 --> 00:52:54,206
Wait! You're okay with this?

625
00:52:54,289 --> 00:52:57,083
Sending in a bunch of untrained,
unauthorized freaks?

626
00:52:57,125 --> 00:53:01,630
These freaks are dedicated,
hardworking people.

627
00:53:02,714 --> 00:53:04,216
Plane leaves for Russia in an hour.

628
00:53:04,299 --> 00:53:06,218
I'm telling you, these kids
are not ready for Shaw.

629
00:53:06,301 --> 00:53:07,344
I think they're gonna surprise you.

630
00:53:07,427 --> 00:53:08,678
They're an exceptional
bunch of young people.

631
00:53:08,762 --> 00:53:09,804
What the hell?

632
00:53:18,772 --> 00:53:20,815
Come on! You can go harder than that.

633
00:53:22,651 --> 00:53:23,818
Harder!

634
00:53:24,528 --> 00:53:25,570
Harder!

635
00:53:28,532 --> 00:53:30,242
What are you doing?

636
00:53:36,248 --> 00:53:37,791
Who destroyed the statue?

637
00:53:37,832 --> 00:53:39,376
It was Alex.

638
00:53:39,459 --> 00:53:40,752
No, Havok.

639
00:53:40,835 --> 00:53:42,921
We have to call him Havok.
That's his name now.

640
00:53:43,004 --> 00:53:46,758
And we were thinking,
you should be Professor X

641
00:53:46,883 --> 00:53:49,010
and you should be Magneto.

642
00:53:50,387 --> 00:53:51,513
Exceptional.

643
00:53:56,268 --> 00:53:57,811
I expect more from you.

644
00:54:18,957 --> 00:54:20,375
- We got a problem.
- What?

645
00:54:20,417 --> 00:54:22,544
I'm so sorry. This wasn't on the map.

646
00:54:29,092 --> 00:54:32,387
No matter what happens, act normally.
I'll take care of this, all right?

647
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,723
Now, listen to me...

648
00:54:37,934 --> 00:54:40,353
<font color="#ffff00">- Where are you going?
- To our farm.</font>

649
00:54:42,606 --> 00:54:44,024
<font color="#ffff00">Open the back.</font>

650
00:54:44,065 --> 00:54:45,984
<font color="#ffff00">As you wish.</font>

651
00:54:50,238 --> 00:54:52,073
Easy, easy. Take it easy, chaps.

652
00:55:08,131 --> 00:55:10,634
<font color="#ffff00">- Anything back there?
- Nothing. It's empty.</font>

653
00:55:13,928 --> 00:55:15,597
<font color="#ffff00">- Everything okay?
- Yes.</font>

654
00:55:38,703 --> 00:55:41,331
- Where is Shaw?
- I don't know.

655
00:55:41,414 --> 00:55:44,709
But if she's a telepath and I read her,
she'll know we're here.

656
00:55:46,086 --> 00:55:48,088
Let me try something else.

657
00:56:05,313 --> 00:56:07,732
Shaw sends his apologies
but he's indisposed.

658
00:56:07,816 --> 00:56:10,443
He asked me to come in his place.

659
00:56:10,485 --> 00:56:14,739
And between you and I, honey,
I'm a lot better company.

660
00:56:14,823 --> 00:56:15,949
Please, come in.

661
00:56:21,371 --> 00:56:22,414
He's not coming.

662
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:27,168
So, what now, boss?

663
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:29,754
Now, nothing. We're here for Shaw.
Mission aborted.

664
00:56:29,838 --> 00:56:31,589
- The hell it is.
- Erik.

665
00:56:31,673 --> 00:56:34,342
She's his right-hand woman.
That's good enough for me.

666
00:56:34,634 --> 00:56:38,054
The CIA invading the home of a senior
Soviet official. Are you crazy?

667
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,265
I'm not CIA.

668
00:56:40,515 --> 00:56:41,516
Erik!

669
00:56:44,853 --> 00:56:46,354
<font color="#ffff00">Your health.</font>

670
00:56:50,567 --> 00:56:52,527
So, you must be busy
planning your next move.

671
00:56:52,569 --> 00:56:55,822
What with the Americans refusing
to remove their missiles from Turkey.

672
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:00,410
You know I can't talk about
those things, Miss Frost.

673
00:57:01,035 --> 00:57:02,537
Emma.

674
00:57:05,373 --> 00:57:07,417
And don't worry.

675
00:57:08,001 --> 00:57:10,128
You don't have to say a word.

676
00:57:26,019 --> 00:57:27,353
He's gonna start
World War III single-handed.

677
00:57:27,395 --> 00:57:30,023
- We have to do something.
- Like what?

678
00:57:30,064 --> 00:57:31,399
- We're moving out.
- You can't!

679
00:57:47,707 --> 00:57:49,542
I'm sorry. I can't leave him.

680
00:58:01,638 --> 00:58:04,766
For God's sake, Erik! Be calm.

681
00:58:04,933 --> 00:58:06,267
<font color="#ffff00">Be calm.</font>

682
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:08,520
<font color="#ffff00">Forget my face.</font>

683
00:58:17,487 --> 00:58:21,950
You are beautiful, so beautiful! Yes!

684
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:24,244
Pathetic.

685
00:58:32,293 --> 00:58:33,711
Yes!

686
00:58:35,797 --> 00:58:36,840
Nice trick.

687
00:58:39,759 --> 00:58:40,760
<font color="#ffff00">Who are you?</font>

688
00:58:44,722 --> 00:58:45,723
Go to sleep.

689
00:58:54,148 --> 00:58:56,150
You can stop trying to read my mind, sugar.

690
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:01,072
You're never going to get anything
from me while I'm like this.

691
00:59:14,168 --> 00:59:15,420
So, then, you can just tell us.

692
00:59:18,506 --> 00:59:19,883
Where is Shaw?

693
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:27,348
Erik.

694
00:59:33,938 --> 00:59:35,064
Erik, that's enough.

695
00:59:43,781 --> 00:59:44,824
Erik, that's enough!

696
00:59:55,043 --> 00:59:56,044
All yours.

697
00:59:57,712 --> 01:00:00,590
She won't be shifting
into diamond form again.

698
01:00:00,673 --> 01:00:03,051
And if she does, just give her a gentle tap.

699
01:00:29,154 --> 01:00:32,407
<i>We are the children of the atom.</i>

700
01:00:35,452 --> 01:00:39,831
<i>What will kill the humans
will only make us stronger.</i>

701
01:00:44,211 --> 01:00:45,295
Beautiful, isn't it?

702
01:00:48,713 --> 01:00:51,299
This is worse than we previously imagined.

703
01:00:53,676 --> 01:00:55,428
We're taking you with us.

704
01:00:55,511 --> 01:00:57,597
CIA will want to question you themselves.

705
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,348
Oh, I doubt it.

706
01:00:59,432 --> 01:01:02,518
They have bigger things
to worry about right now.

707
01:01:08,149 --> 01:01:10,359
- Whoa!
- All right, all right.

708
01:01:10,443 --> 01:01:12,445
Jesus, man, you are killing me.

709
01:01:12,528 --> 01:01:15,615
Don't beat yourself up.
I've had a lot of spare time.

710
01:01:20,453 --> 01:01:22,246
I didn't know the circus was in town.

711
01:01:22,705 --> 01:01:24,874
Hey, come on, honey. Give us a little...

712
01:01:25,583 --> 01:01:28,044
No? Come on, let's see the foot.

713
01:01:28,127 --> 01:01:29,795
There it is. Come on, Big Foot, let's go.

714
01:01:29,879 --> 01:01:32,215
Hey. Hey, come on. Hey.

715
01:01:36,552 --> 01:01:38,596
They're just guys being stupid.

716
01:01:38,679 --> 01:01:41,933
Guys being stupid, I can handle. Okay?
I've handled that my whole life.

717
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:44,477
But I'd rather a bunch of guys
stare at me with my clothes off

718
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:45,895
than the way these ones stare at me.

719
01:01:47,813 --> 01:01:48,856
At us.

720
01:01:57,156 --> 01:01:58,157
What was that?

721
01:02:00,618 --> 01:02:02,912
I don't know. Something doesn't feel right.

722
01:02:11,921 --> 01:02:13,130
No news of Shaw?

723
01:02:13,714 --> 01:02:16,509
- Not a peep.
- Not even through that back channel?

724
01:02:29,063 --> 01:02:30,106
What is that?

725
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:50,376
- We have an intruder in the main atrium.
- Where are the mutants?

726
01:02:50,459 --> 01:02:52,211
If you take another step,
I'm gonna put you down.

727
01:02:52,295 --> 01:02:55,548
Of course you will. But where do
I find the more evolved people?

728
01:02:56,465 --> 01:02:57,717
Send back-up now!

729
01:03:00,928 --> 01:03:03,973
Get back! Do not leave that room.
We're under attack!

730
01:03:05,057 --> 01:03:06,058
Shoot! Shoot!

731
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:20,823
Where are the mutants?

732
01:03:20,865 --> 01:03:23,326
Put that man down or we will open fire!

733
01:03:49,018 --> 01:03:51,020
Stay here, my ass! Let's go!

734
01:03:56,692 --> 01:03:59,236
- Get back!
- We can help! We can help!

735
01:04:58,963 --> 01:04:59,964
Wait!

736
01:05:00,047 --> 01:05:01,882
You want the mutants?
They're right through that door.

737
01:05:02,007 --> 01:05:04,343
Just let us normal people go.
We're no threat...

738
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,897
- Where is the telepath?
- Not here.

739
01:05:17,314 --> 01:05:18,732
Too bad.

740
01:05:18,941 --> 01:05:20,609
Well, at least I can take
this silly thing off.

741
01:05:23,028 --> 01:05:26,907
Good evening.
My name is Sebastian Shaw.

742
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:30,286
And I am not here to hurt you.

743
01:05:30,536 --> 01:05:31,829
Freeze!

744
01:05:32,246 --> 01:05:33,789
Azazel.

745
01:05:37,126 --> 01:05:40,713
My friends, there is a revolution coming.

746
01:05:40,796 --> 01:05:44,133
When mankind discovers
who we are, what we can do,

747
01:05:44,216 --> 01:05:45,968
each of us will face a choice.

748
01:05:46,802 --> 01:05:48,220
Be enslaved

749
01:05:49,597 --> 01:05:51,307
or rise up to rule.

750
01:05:52,308 --> 01:05:54,518
Choose freely, but know
that if you are not with us,

751
01:05:54,602 --> 01:05:56,312
then, by definition, you are

752
01:05:56,687 --> 01:05:58,230
against us.

753
01:05:59,064 --> 01:06:01,275
So, you can stay

754
01:06:01,859 --> 01:06:04,820
and fight for the people
who hate and fear you,

755
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:09,783
or you can join me and live like kings.

756
01:06:16,332 --> 01:06:17,583
And queens.

757
01:06:29,303 --> 01:06:30,846
- Angel.
- Are you kidding me?

758
01:06:31,722 --> 01:06:33,557
Come on.

759
01:06:33,641 --> 01:06:35,476
We don't belong here.

760
01:06:35,851 --> 01:06:37,937
And that's nothing to be ashamed of.

761
01:06:42,983 --> 01:06:44,902
We have to do something.

762
01:07:00,209 --> 01:07:03,045
Stop. I'm coming with you.

763
01:07:07,007 --> 01:07:08,676
Good choice.

764
01:07:09,677 --> 01:07:11,720
So, tell me about your mutation.

765
01:07:12,555 --> 01:07:14,181
Well, I adapt to survive.

766
01:07:17,851 --> 01:07:19,270
So, I guess I'm coming with you.

767
01:07:19,937 --> 01:07:21,480
I like that.

768
01:07:27,736 --> 01:07:29,154
- Alex!
- Get out!

769
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,656
Do it!

770
01:07:35,536 --> 01:07:37,580
Protecting your fellow mutants?

771
01:07:38,539 --> 01:07:39,915
That's a noble gesture.

772
01:07:40,583 --> 01:07:42,084
Feels good.

773
01:07:47,881 --> 01:07:49,508
Adapt to this.

774
01:08:33,761 --> 01:08:35,512
<font color="#ffff00">Hello.</font>

775
01:08:36,764 --> 01:08:43,729
<font color="#ffff00">Once again, my sympathies for your
treatment at the hands of the CIA.</font>

776
01:08:43,979 --> 01:08:46,982
<font color="#ffff00">These Americans are ruthless.</font>

777
01:08:48,150 --> 01:08:52,655
<font color="#ffff00">Now they have their missiles
placed in Turkey...</font>

778
01:08:53,697 --> 01:08:57,951
<font color="#ffff00">...I expect you'll be planning
new missile sites of your own.</font>

779
01:08:58,285 --> 01:09:04,667
<font color="#ffff00">Somewhere you know the American
early-warning system won't help.</font>

780
01:09:05,292 --> 01:09:09,296
<font color="#ffff00">I hear Cuba is lovely this time of year.</font>

781
01:09:10,005 --> 01:09:12,508
<font color="#ffff00">And so close to Florida.</font>

782
01:09:13,842 --> 01:09:15,844
<font color="#ffff00">Missiles in Cuba?</font>

783
01:09:18,097 --> 01:09:19,807
<font color="#ffff00">You're serious?</font>

784
01:09:20,516 --> 01:09:23,394
<font color="#ffff00">We may as well declare war.</font>

785
01:09:24,395 --> 01:09:26,480
Maybe I wasn't clear enough.

786
01:09:29,024 --> 01:09:31,360
You will make this happen.

787
01:09:33,237 --> 01:09:34,530
<font color="#ffff00">Okay.</font>

788
01:09:35,114 --> 01:09:37,533
Let's see what KGB think about this.

789
01:09:42,287 --> 01:09:45,708
<font color="#ffff00">Hello? General Armivolkoff.</font>

790
01:09:48,585 --> 01:09:51,380
<font color="#ffff00">It's nothing.</font>

791
01:10:06,437 --> 01:10:07,896
Raven?

792
01:10:13,736 --> 01:10:15,738
We've made arrangements for you
to be taken home immediately.

793
01:10:15,821 --> 01:10:17,364
- We're not going home.
- What?

794
01:10:17,906 --> 01:10:19,742
He's not going back to prison.

795
01:10:19,825 --> 01:10:20,993
He killed Darwin.

796
01:10:21,076 --> 01:10:22,453
All the more reason for you to leave.

797
01:10:22,911 --> 01:10:24,329
This is over.

798
01:10:24,413 --> 01:10:26,415
Darwin's dead, Charles.

799
01:10:26,498 --> 01:10:28,333
And we can't even bury him.

800
01:10:31,211 --> 01:10:32,254
We can avenge him.

801
01:10:35,799 --> 01:10:37,801
Erik, a word, please.

802
01:10:41,221 --> 01:10:44,433
- They're just kids.
- No. They were kids.

803
01:10:44,516 --> 01:10:46,852
Shaw has his army, we need ours.

804
01:10:52,775 --> 01:10:54,026
We'll have to train.

805
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:56,779
All of us.

806
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:58,447
- Yes?
- Yeah.

807
01:10:59,323 --> 01:11:01,158
Well, we can't stay here.

808
01:11:01,241 --> 01:11:04,578
Even if they reopen
the department, it's not safe.

809
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:06,747
We've got nowhere to go.

810
01:11:09,416 --> 01:11:10,459
Yes, we do.

811
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:13,462
The law says we've got to turn her over.

812
01:11:13,504 --> 01:11:15,631
The law applies to human beings.

813
01:11:15,714 --> 01:11:19,176
The same laws don't apply to mutants.
They're too dangerous.

814
01:11:19,259 --> 01:11:23,430
In times like this, security is
more important than liberty.

815
01:11:23,472 --> 01:11:26,141
- There is a war coming, John.
- Yes,

816
01:11:26,767 --> 01:11:28,310
but a war with who?

817
01:11:42,407 --> 01:11:44,493
Excellent question.

818
01:11:44,576 --> 01:11:47,371
Though I wouldn't call it a war, exactly.

819
01:11:47,454 --> 01:11:50,833
That suggests both sides stand
an equal chance of winning.

820
01:12:00,384 --> 01:12:02,928
<font color="#ffff00">Captain, no sign of any American ships.</font>

821
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:05,764
<font color="#ffff00">Maintain course, full ahead.</font>

822
01:12:06,306 --> 01:12:09,184
The Russians have sent
their warheads to Cuba.

823
01:12:09,268 --> 01:12:11,436
We have a week before
the ship hits the coast.

824
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:15,649
Our fleet can be on this line when
the Russian missile ship arrives.

825
01:12:16,358 --> 01:12:19,236
If that ship crosses the line,

826
01:12:19,319 --> 01:12:22,364
they will have declared war
against the United States.

827
01:12:22,447 --> 01:12:26,034
And we will have no choice but to retaliate
with a full nuclear response.

828
01:12:26,076 --> 01:12:27,119
Do we agree?

829
01:12:32,666 --> 01:12:35,335
Dispatch the 7th fleet.

830
01:12:37,379 --> 01:12:38,922
This is yours?

831
01:12:39,006 --> 01:12:41,216
No, it's ours.

832
01:12:47,389 --> 01:12:52,102
Honestly, Charles. I don't know how
you survived, living in such hardship.

833
01:12:52,227 --> 01:12:55,772
Well, it was a hardship softened by me.

834
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,360
Come on. Time for the tour.

835
01:13:13,332 --> 01:13:15,292
<font color="#ffff00">Dear comrades...</font>

836
01:13:15,417 --> 01:13:22,090
<font color="#ffff00">The United States have
dispatched warships for Cuba.</font>

837
01:13:23,175 --> 01:13:27,095
<font color="#ffff00">This leaves us with no choice.</font>

838
01:13:28,513 --> 01:13:31,934
<font color="#ffff00">Comrade First Secretary...</font>

839
01:13:32,768 --> 01:13:35,437
<font color="#ffff00">We must send in our fleet.</font>

840
01:13:38,607 --> 01:13:40,145
<font color="#ffff00">Dispatch the fleet!</font>

841
01:13:46,068 --> 01:13:48,987
<i>President Kennedy has signed
a formal proclamation</i>

842
01:13:49,071 --> 01:13:52,657
<i>setting up a blockade
of all missiles bound for Cuba.</i>

843
01:13:53,825 --> 01:13:55,911
<i>The Soviet Union reacted by terming it</i>

844
01:13:55,994 --> 01:13:59,915
<i>"A step along the road to unleashing
a thermo-nuclear war."</i>

845
01:14:10,759 --> 01:14:11,843
You're sure?

846
01:14:12,381 --> 01:14:14,133
I'm sure.

847
01:14:14,216 --> 01:14:15,718
All right.

848
01:14:22,350 --> 01:14:24,352
No. No, I can't. I'm sorry.

849
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:26,562
I can't shoot anybody point blank,
let alone my friend.

850
01:14:26,646 --> 01:14:28,689
Oh, come on. You know I can deflect it.

851
01:14:28,731 --> 01:14:30,107
You're always telling me
I should push myself.

852
01:14:30,191 --> 01:14:35,404
If you know you can deflect it,
then you're not challenging yourself.

853
01:14:35,446 --> 01:14:38,741
Whatever happened to the man
who was trying to raise a submarine?

854
01:14:38,824 --> 01:14:43,287
I can't. Something that big?
I need the situation, the anger...

855
01:14:43,371 --> 01:14:44,955
No, the anger is not enough.

856
01:14:45,831 --> 01:14:47,416
It's gotten the job done all this time.

857
01:14:47,667 --> 01:14:49,585
It's nearly gotten you killed all this time.

858
01:14:50,753 --> 01:14:52,713
Come here.

859
01:14:52,755 --> 01:14:54,715
Let's try something
a little more challenging.

860
01:14:56,425 --> 01:15:00,721
My stepfather took the possibility
of nuclear war quite seriously. This way.

861
01:15:00,763 --> 01:15:02,932
That is why he had this
bunker built down here.

862
01:15:02,973 --> 01:15:05,476
I thought we could use it
as a practice range of sorts.

863
01:15:05,559 --> 01:15:07,436
You don't think I'm going
to blow through the walls?

864
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,772
He had this place built
to withstand a nuclear bomb.

865
01:15:09,814 --> 01:15:11,232
I think it can handle you, Alex.

866
01:15:11,857 --> 01:15:14,568
You know, when I do this,
bad things tend to happen.

867
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:18,739
That's because you can't control it.
It controls you.

868
01:15:18,781 --> 01:15:21,242
That's why we're here, Alex.
It's why we're training.

869
01:15:26,414 --> 01:15:28,999
What you're doing is incredible.
You're hitting a pitch with sound waves

870
01:15:29,083 --> 01:15:31,711
that have the same resonant frequency
as the glass. That's why it shatters.

871
01:15:31,794 --> 01:15:34,296
But this, it's like any other
muscle in the body.

872
01:15:34,338 --> 01:15:36,298
You can control it.

873
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:40,469
"In each of us, two natures are at war."

874
01:15:40,553 --> 01:15:42,346
Robert Louis Stevenson, <i>Jekyll and Hyde</i>.

875
01:15:42,430 --> 01:15:43,472
Top marks.

876
01:15:43,514 --> 01:15:45,474
The story wasn't really about
good and evil though, was it?

877
01:15:45,558 --> 01:15:49,478
It was about man's animal nature and
his struggle to control it, to conform.

878
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:52,064
And it's that struggle
which is holding you back.

879
01:15:52,398 --> 01:15:55,443
No, Jekyll was afraid of what
he could be capable of.

880
01:15:55,484 --> 01:15:57,278
And you are, too.

881
01:15:57,319 --> 01:15:59,655
If you're serious about me doing this,
you might want to get back.

882
01:15:59,822 --> 01:16:01,157
All right.

883
01:16:01,365 --> 01:16:03,200
- Shall I shut the door?
- Yeah.

884
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:08,581
Whenever you're ready.

885
01:16:15,045 --> 01:16:16,130
Oh, my God!

886
01:16:19,717 --> 01:16:22,011
I will teach you to control this, Alex.

887
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:27,600
And you're sure that this will work?

888
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:29,477
Anything is possible. I based the design...

889
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:31,854
Hank, stop talking. Come on.

890
01:16:32,229 --> 01:16:34,023
Now, remember.
Scream as hard as you can.

891
01:16:34,106 --> 01:16:36,025
You need the sound waves
to be supersonic.

892
01:16:36,108 --> 01:16:38,194
Catch them at the right angle
and they should carry you.

893
01:16:38,486 --> 01:16:40,613
They should carry me.

894
01:16:40,696 --> 01:16:43,240
- That's reassuring.
- Good luck.

895
01:16:44,241 --> 01:16:46,076
And don't forget to scream.

896
01:16:55,336 --> 01:16:59,465
Now, if you want to beat me this time,
you have to set the beast free.

897
01:17:00,382 --> 01:17:01,801
On your marks,

898
01:17:02,259 --> 01:17:03,385
get set,

899
01:17:03,844 --> 01:17:05,179
go!

900
01:17:19,568 --> 01:17:21,570
Congratulations, my friend.

901
01:17:21,654 --> 01:17:22,988
Robert Louis Stevenson
would have been proud.

902
01:17:25,366 --> 01:17:26,909
Impressive, Hank.

903
01:17:26,951 --> 01:17:28,661
With feet like those,
all you need is a red nose.

904
01:17:29,078 --> 01:17:30,746
Right, Bozo?

905
01:17:30,788 --> 01:17:32,832
- I'm done here.
- Thank you, Alex.

906
01:17:34,083 --> 01:17:35,292
Come on, Hank.

907
01:17:46,053 --> 01:17:48,764
If you're using half your
concentration to look normal,

908
01:17:49,390 --> 01:17:52,476
then you're only half paying attention
to whatever else you're doing.

909
01:17:52,852 --> 01:17:56,230
Just pointing out something
that could save your life.

910
01:17:59,692 --> 01:18:01,360
You want society to accept you,

911
01:18:02,444 --> 01:18:05,114
but you can't even accept yourself.

912
01:18:10,786 --> 01:18:12,580
Sexy!

913
01:18:12,621 --> 01:18:14,123
Well, this is just the prototype.

914
01:18:14,164 --> 01:18:15,624
The real one will look considerably better.

915
01:18:15,708 --> 01:18:18,711
It will be a whole suit. See, these
sensors measure your energy output.

916
01:18:18,794 --> 01:18:21,463
This panel focuses it and
the excess is absorbed.

917
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:24,258
Try hitting the one in the middle.
Just the one in the middle, mind.

918
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:26,218
Good luck.

919
01:18:36,353 --> 01:18:39,231
You got to see this. Your genes
are extraordinary, you know that?

920
01:18:39,315 --> 01:18:40,983
Your cells age at half the rate
of a normal human.

921
01:18:41,025 --> 01:18:43,861
When you're 40, you'll still have
the leukocytes of a teenager.

922
01:18:43,944 --> 01:18:48,324
You have the most incredible
cellular structure I've ever seen.

923
01:18:52,703 --> 01:18:54,580
And you truly believe I'll fly this time?

924
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:55,998
Unreservedly.

925
01:18:56,457 --> 01:18:57,750
- I trust you.
- I'm touched.

926
01:18:57,833 --> 01:18:59,627
- I don't trust him.
- Say nothing.

927
01:19:00,836 --> 01:19:02,379
I'm gonna die!

928
01:19:02,463 --> 01:19:04,381
Look, we're not going to make you
do anything you don't feel...

929
01:19:04,465 --> 01:19:05,674
Here, let me help.

930
01:19:07,509 --> 01:19:08,552
Erik!

931
01:19:29,823 --> 01:19:31,325
What?

932
01:19:31,367 --> 01:19:33,035
You know you were thinking the same.

933
01:19:33,786 --> 01:19:35,204
Wonderful work, Hank.
Thank you very much.

934
01:19:35,287 --> 01:19:37,081
All right, Alex, I want you to hit the "X".

935
01:19:37,998 --> 01:19:39,541
And try not to hit me.
There's a good chap.

936
01:19:40,584 --> 01:19:43,128
- You're serious?
- I'm very serious.

937
01:19:43,671 --> 01:19:45,464
I have complete and utter faith in you.

938
01:19:58,769 --> 01:19:59,853
Am I still a bozo?

939
01:20:00,479 --> 01:20:03,273
Yes, Hank, you're still a bozo.

940
01:20:03,565 --> 01:20:04,566
But nice job.

941
01:20:07,778 --> 01:20:08,904
See that?

942
01:20:09,613 --> 01:20:11,740
Try turning it to face us.

943
01:20:30,634 --> 01:20:35,764
You know, I believe that true focus lies
somewhere between rage and serenity.

944
01:20:37,725 --> 01:20:39,435
Would you mind if I...

945
01:21:13,886 --> 01:21:15,512
What did you just do to me?

946
01:21:16,930 --> 01:21:20,684
I accessed the brightest corner
of your memory system.

947
01:21:22,478 --> 01:21:25,689
It's a very beautiful memory, Erik.
Thank you.

948
01:21:25,773 --> 01:21:28,358
I didn't know I still had that.

949
01:21:28,984 --> 01:21:31,653
There is so much more
to you than you know.

950
01:21:31,737 --> 01:21:34,740
Not just pain and anger.

951
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:36,408
There is good, too. I felt it.

952
01:21:37,785 --> 01:21:39,661
When you can access all of that,

953
01:21:40,162 --> 01:21:42,915
you'll possess a power no one can match.

954
01:21:44,124 --> 01:21:45,501
Not even me.

955
01:21:47,169 --> 01:21:49,755
So, come on. Try again.

956
01:22:30,337 --> 01:22:31,880
- Hey!
- Well done.

957
01:22:32,131 --> 01:22:33,966
The President is about to make his address.

958
01:22:36,093 --> 01:22:40,222
<i>It shall be the policy of this nation
to regard any nuclear missile</i>

959
01:22:40,264 --> 01:22:43,934
<i>crossing the embargo line
that surrounds Cuba</i>

960
01:22:44,017 --> 01:22:48,230
<i>as an attack by the Soviet Union
on the United States</i>

961
01:22:48,313 --> 01:22:51,984
<i>requiring a full retaliatory
response upon the Soviet Union...</i>

962
01:22:52,067 --> 01:22:54,444
- That's where we're going to find Shaw.
- How do you know?

963
01:22:54,528 --> 01:22:58,240
Two superpowers facing off and
he wants to start World War III.

964
01:22:58,282 --> 01:22:59,992
He won't leave anything to chance.

965
01:23:00,117 --> 01:23:01,994
So much for diplomacy.

966
01:23:02,077 --> 01:23:04,454
I suggest you all get a good night's sleep.

967
01:23:04,538 --> 01:23:06,582
<i>...ultimately leads to war.</i>

968
01:23:07,541 --> 01:23:11,920
<i>Tensions mount as the Soviet
missile ship nears Cuba.</i>

969
01:23:11,962 --> 01:23:16,800
<i>All diplomatic efforts to avert
nuclear war have thus far failed.</i>

970
01:23:16,884 --> 01:23:21,263
<i>As the American people ready themselves
for the likelihood of an atomic attack,</i>

971
01:23:21,346 --> 01:23:24,766
<i>there are widespread
reports of panic-buying,</i>

972
01:23:24,808 --> 01:23:29,188
<i>supermarkets cleared, as shelters
unused since the Second World War</i>

973
01:23:29,271 --> 01:23:31,773
<i>are stocked for what may lie ahead.</i>

974
01:23:31,857 --> 01:23:36,445
<i>In all its history, America has
never faced a greater threat.</i>

975
01:23:36,612 --> 01:23:38,280
The world is primed for war

976
01:23:38,447 --> 01:23:40,908
and there's no one to stop me.

977
01:23:45,913 --> 01:23:46,955
Come in.

978
01:23:48,081 --> 01:23:49,458
Hey.

979
01:23:50,209 --> 01:23:52,211
I have a surprise for you.

980
01:24:00,636 --> 01:24:04,264
I isolated the right marker
in your DNA sample.

981
01:24:04,306 --> 01:24:06,141
The serum works like an antibiotic,

982
01:24:06,225 --> 01:24:09,394
attacking the cells that cause
our physical mutation.

983
01:24:09,478 --> 01:24:12,189
It won't affect our abilities,
just our appearance.

984
01:24:14,816 --> 01:24:16,485
Do you still want to do this?

985
01:24:17,945 --> 01:24:19,988
Should we have to hide?

986
01:24:21,406 --> 01:24:23,283
Well, you already do.

987
01:24:23,325 --> 01:24:26,286
You're hiding right now,
like I have my whole life.

988
01:24:27,079 --> 01:24:30,374
I don't want to feel like a freak
all the time. I just want to look...

989
01:24:30,457 --> 01:24:32,501
- Normal.
- Yeah.

990
01:24:39,841 --> 01:24:40,842
Hank, don't!

991
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:45,222
You're beautiful, Hank.

992
01:24:45,305 --> 01:24:47,516
Everything you are, you are perfect.

993
01:24:50,143 --> 01:24:53,522
Look at all of us. Look at all
we've achieved this week.

994
01:24:53,563 --> 01:24:55,565
All we will achieve.

995
01:24:56,733 --> 01:24:59,194
We are different.

996
01:24:59,278 --> 01:25:01,697
But we shouldn't be trying
to fit into society.

997
01:25:02,781 --> 01:25:05,951
Society should aspire to be more like us.

998
01:25:06,952 --> 01:25:09,997
Mutant and proud.

999
01:25:15,043 --> 01:25:16,795
It behooves me to tell you

1000
01:25:16,878 --> 01:25:22,175
that even if we save the world tomorrow,
and mutants are accepted into society,

1001
01:25:22,217 --> 01:25:25,679
my feet and your natural blue form

1002
01:25:25,721 --> 01:25:27,681
will never be deemed beautiful.

1003
01:25:33,145 --> 01:25:34,563
You look beautiful now.

1004
01:25:36,732 --> 01:25:39,818
We need this cure.

1005
01:26:06,845 --> 01:26:08,889
Cuba.

1006
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:10,515
Russia, America.

1007
01:26:10,599 --> 01:26:12,559
It makes no difference.

1008
01:26:12,601 --> 01:26:15,604
Shaw has declared war
on mankind, on all of us.

1009
01:26:15,687 --> 01:26:16,688
He has to be stopped.

1010
01:26:18,565 --> 01:26:19,816
I'm not going to stop Shaw.

1011
01:26:20,776 --> 01:26:21,777
I'm going to kill him.

1012
01:26:24,988 --> 01:26:27,532
Do you have it in you to allow that?

1013
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:35,624
You've known all along why
I was here, Charles.

1014
01:26:36,083 --> 01:26:38,377
But things have changed.

1015
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:40,462
What started as a covert mission,

1016
01:26:40,504 --> 01:26:43,256
tomorrow, mankind will know
that mutants exist.

1017
01:26:43,298 --> 01:26:46,468
Shaw, us, they won't differentiate.

1018
01:26:46,510 --> 01:26:48,095
They'll fear us.

1019
01:26:48,303 --> 01:26:50,055
And that fear will turn to hatred.

1020
01:26:50,389 --> 01:26:52,182
Not if we stop a war.

1021
01:26:52,265 --> 01:26:55,560
Not if we can prevent Shaw.
Not if we risk our lives doing so.

1022
01:26:55,685 --> 01:26:58,814
- Would they do the same for us?
- We have it in us to be the better men.

1023
01:26:58,897 --> 01:27:00,857
We already are.

1024
01:27:00,941 --> 01:27:02,567
We're the next stage of human evolution.

1025
01:27:02,651 --> 01:27:04,694
- You said it yourself!
- No...

1026
01:27:04,778 --> 01:27:06,571
Are you really so naive

1027
01:27:06,655 --> 01:27:09,991
as to think that they won't
battle their own extinction?

1028
01:27:10,742 --> 01:27:13,662
- Or is it arrogance?
- I'm sorry?

1029
01:27:14,246 --> 01:27:16,164
After tomorrow,
they're going to turn on us.

1030
01:27:16,206 --> 01:27:19,459
But you're blind to it, because you
believe they're all like Moira.

1031
01:27:19,876 --> 01:27:21,837
And you believe they're all like Shaw.

1032
01:27:24,381 --> 01:27:28,468
Listen to me very carefully, my friend.

1033
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:31,430
Killing Shaw will not bring you peace.

1034
01:27:33,181 --> 01:27:35,684
Peace was never an option.

1035
01:28:21,938 --> 01:28:23,190
No.

1036
01:28:24,649 --> 01:28:26,067
No, no. No.

1037
01:28:55,096 --> 01:28:56,890
Well,

1038
01:28:58,517 --> 01:28:59,976
this is a surprise.

1039
01:29:00,268 --> 01:29:01,728
The nice kind?

1040
01:29:03,647 --> 01:29:07,234
Get out, Raven.
I want to go to bed.

1041
01:29:07,275 --> 01:29:09,736
Maybe in a few years.

1042
01:29:13,490 --> 01:29:15,325
How about now?

1043
01:29:20,247 --> 01:29:21,790
I prefer the real Raven.

1044
01:29:25,710 --> 01:29:29,130
I said the real Raven.

1045
01:29:38,139 --> 01:29:39,391
Perfection.

1046
01:29:44,020 --> 01:29:45,522
Could you pass me my robe?

1047
01:29:45,814 --> 01:29:48,024
You don't have to hide.

1048
01:29:52,153 --> 01:29:53,822
Have you ever looked at a tiger

1049
01:29:53,989 --> 01:29:56,783
and thought you ought to cover it up?

1050
01:29:58,159 --> 01:29:59,661
No, but...

1051
01:29:59,869 --> 01:30:02,205
You're an exquisite creature, Raven.

1052
01:30:03,748 --> 01:30:06,251
All your life, the world
has tried to tame you.

1053
01:30:07,085 --> 01:30:08,712
It's time for you to be free.

1054
01:30:29,524 --> 01:30:31,693
You know, sometimes I wonder
what my life would have been like

1055
01:30:31,776 --> 01:30:34,070
if you hadn't found me here that night.

1056
01:30:34,154 --> 01:30:35,614
Sorry, what? You...

1057
01:30:37,866 --> 01:30:39,701
For God's sake, Raven!

1058
01:30:39,743 --> 01:30:42,037
Where are your clothes?
Put some clothes on.

1059
01:30:42,078 --> 01:30:43,955
That's not what you said
when you first saw me.

1060
01:30:44,748 --> 01:30:48,335
But I guess pets are always cuter
when they're little, right?

1061
01:30:48,376 --> 01:30:50,086
Raven, I don't know
what's gotten into you lately.

1062
01:30:50,754 --> 01:30:52,213
I thought you'd be in a good mood.

1063
01:30:52,756 --> 01:30:58,219
Hank, he tells me that he's found
the answer to your cosmetic problem.

1064
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:02,098
Are you gonna tell me what's the matter
or do I have to read your mind?

1065
01:31:02,641 --> 01:31:04,351
You promised me you would never do that.

1066
01:31:04,392 --> 01:31:06,061
Until recently,

1067
01:31:06,144 --> 01:31:09,022
I never had to use my power to know
what you were thinking, Raven.

1068
01:31:09,064 --> 01:31:12,901
Charles, I used to think it was going
to be you and me against the world.

1069
01:31:12,984 --> 01:31:16,363
But no matter how bad the world gets,
you don't want to be against it, do you?

1070
01:31:16,404 --> 01:31:17,405
You want to be a part of it.

1071
01:31:40,053 --> 01:31:41,262
What the hell happened here?

1072
01:31:49,729 --> 01:31:51,564
Hank has been busy.

1073
01:31:51,606 --> 01:31:53,775
Do we really have to wear these?

1074
01:31:53,858 --> 01:31:56,611
As none of us mutated
to endure extreme g-force

1075
01:31:56,695 --> 01:31:59,948
or being riddled by bullets,
I suggest we suit up.

1076
01:32:24,431 --> 01:32:25,807
Where is Hank?

1077
01:32:27,642 --> 01:32:29,102
I'm here.

1078
01:32:38,570 --> 01:32:40,363
Hank?

1079
01:32:45,452 --> 01:32:48,663
It didn't attack the cells.

1080
01:32:48,705 --> 01:32:52,167
It enhanced them.

1081
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:53,543
It didn't work.

1082
01:32:54,002 --> 01:32:56,838
Yes, it did, Hank. Don't you see?

1083
01:32:57,130 --> 01:33:00,341
This is who you were meant to be.

1084
01:33:00,675 --> 01:33:02,010
This is you.

1085
01:33:04,179 --> 01:33:05,513
No more hiding.

1086
01:33:06,473 --> 01:33:08,850
- You never looked better, man.
- Hank!

1087
01:33:10,643 --> 01:33:12,979
Don't mock me!

1088
01:33:13,021 --> 01:33:14,522
Hank, put him down immediately, please.

1089
01:33:15,023 --> 01:33:16,065
Hank! Hank!

1090
01:33:19,068 --> 01:33:20,487
I wasn't.

1091
01:33:20,904 --> 01:33:22,614
Even I got to admit you
look pretty badass.

1092
01:33:23,156 --> 01:33:24,616
I think I got a new name for you.

1093
01:33:25,533 --> 01:33:26,576
Beast.

1094
01:33:29,078 --> 01:33:30,663
You're sure you can fly this thing?

1095
01:33:30,830 --> 01:33:33,541
Of course I can. I designed it.

1096
01:33:45,553 --> 01:33:47,347
Status of the cargo ship.

1097
01:33:47,388 --> 01:33:50,934
Bearing 1 -8-0 at 12 knots.

1098
01:33:52,727 --> 01:33:55,021
Three minutes to the embargo line, sir.

1099
01:33:56,189 --> 01:33:58,942
God help them if they cross it.

1100
01:34:00,652 --> 01:34:01,903
God help us all.

1101
01:34:02,570 --> 01:34:05,782
- Sound general quarters.
- General quarters, general quarters!

1102
01:34:06,199 --> 01:34:08,743
- All hands, man battle stations!
- Aye, sir.

1103
01:34:08,785 --> 01:34:10,370
Set condition Zebra!

1104
01:34:11,079 --> 01:34:13,081
<i>General quarters, battle stations.</i>

1105
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:29,264
<font color="#ffff00">Captain, we already have our orders.
Why so eager for new ones?</font>

1106
01:34:29,722 --> 01:34:33,226
<font color="#ffff00">I lived through one war, comrade.</font>

1107
01:34:34,561 --> 01:34:36,771
<font color="#ffff00">I'd prefer not to start another.</font>

1108
01:34:39,148 --> 01:34:41,401
<font color="#ffff00">Battle stations! NOW!</font>

1109
01:34:43,945 --> 01:34:48,867
Gun Boss, target cargo ship bearing 1 -8-0.

1110
01:34:50,994 --> 01:34:53,830
<font color="#ffff00">Fleet reports all weapons ready.</font>

1111
01:34:54,289 --> 01:34:56,124
<font color="#ffff00">From the Kremlin, sir.</font>

1112
01:34:56,666 --> 01:35:00,628
<font color="#ffff00">New orders. As of 1025 hours, the cargo
vessel <i>Aral Sea</i> is hereby ordered to...</font>

1113
01:35:01,004 --> 01:35:03,298
<font color="#ffff00">...reverse course
and return to port in Odessa.</font>

1114
01:35:03,464 --> 01:35:05,091
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Aral Sea</i>, come in.</font>

1115
01:35:05,842 --> 01:35:07,468
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Aral Sea</i>, come in.</font>

1116
01:35:08,636 --> 01:35:10,096
<font color="#ffff00">They are not responding.</font>

1117
01:35:10,138 --> 01:35:11,306
<font color="#ffff00">She's not turning around.</font>

1118
01:35:11,556 --> 01:35:14,142
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Aral Sea</i>, you are ordered to turn around.</font>

1119
01:35:14,475 --> 01:35:15,810
<font color="#ffff00">Do not cross the line.</font>

1120
01:35:16,895 --> 01:35:18,855
Target ready to be fired upon, sir.

1121
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:21,900
- Stand by to fire.
- Standing by, sir.

1122
01:35:34,412 --> 01:35:36,998
It looks pretty messy out there.

1123
01:35:47,342 --> 01:35:49,802
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Aral Sea</i> you are ordered to turn around.</font>

1124
01:35:50,678 --> 01:35:53,389
The crew of the <i>Aral Sea</i> are all dead.
Shaw's been there.

1125
01:35:53,473 --> 01:35:54,974
He's still here, somewhere.

1126
01:35:55,016 --> 01:35:56,935
He set the ship on course
for the embargo line.

1127
01:35:57,018 --> 01:35:59,896
If that ship crosses the line,
our boys are going to blow it up.

1128
01:35:59,979 --> 01:36:01,606
And the war begins.

1129
01:36:02,023 --> 01:36:03,524
Unless they're not our boys.

1130
01:36:06,527 --> 01:36:09,113
<i>USS Independence</i>, this is <i>Alexander Nevsky</i>.

1131
01:36:09,197 --> 01:36:10,990
We have lost control of our cargo ship.

1132
01:36:11,032 --> 01:36:12,742
<i>She has been instructed to stop.</i>

1133
01:36:12,825 --> 01:36:15,703
Do not fire! Repeat, do not fire!

1134
01:36:15,745 --> 01:36:19,165
They have signaled the cargo
ship to turn around, sir.

1135
01:36:19,207 --> 01:36:21,584
It's a ruse. Pay no attention!

1136
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:24,587
- Stand by to fire.
- Standing by to fire, sir.

1137
01:36:24,671 --> 01:36:26,839
On my count. Five,

1138
01:36:27,340 --> 01:36:28,716
four...

1139
01:36:51,030 --> 01:36:52,448
Hold on!

1140
01:37:01,874 --> 01:37:02,959
<i>Nyet.</i>

1141
01:37:07,296 --> 01:37:09,257
- What was that?
- The Russians.

1142
01:37:09,340 --> 01:37:10,758
They have fired on their own ship.

1143
01:37:11,509 --> 01:37:13,052
A little warning next time, Professor.

1144
01:37:13,428 --> 01:37:16,305
- Sorry about that. You all right?
- Yeah.

1145
01:37:17,015 --> 01:37:18,558
Son of a...

1146
01:37:18,599 --> 01:37:21,102
Give me CINCLANT on the horn.
I want a new set of orders.

1147
01:37:25,189 --> 01:37:27,275
<font color="#ffff00">Congratulations, comrade.</font>

1148
01:37:27,608 --> 01:37:31,446
<font color="#ffff00">You just averted nuclear war!</font>

1149
01:37:32,030 --> 01:37:33,406
<font color="#ffff00">What?</font>

1150
01:37:33,489 --> 01:37:35,158
<font color="#ffff00">Take him to the brig.</font>

1151
01:37:35,241 --> 01:37:38,911
<font color="#ffff00">What? What just happened?</font>

1152
01:37:38,953 --> 01:37:40,872
They say the comrade lost his mind.

1153
01:37:41,122 --> 01:37:43,750
The Americans are applauding.

1154
01:37:44,751 --> 01:37:48,296
They're here. That telepath is powerful.

1155
01:37:50,465 --> 01:37:53,134
We're moving to a back-up plan.

1156
01:37:54,969 --> 01:37:56,387
That was inspired, Charles.

1157
01:37:56,471 --> 01:37:58,473
Thank you very much,
but I still can't locate Shaw.

1158
01:37:58,556 --> 01:38:00,641
He's down there. We need to find him now.

1159
01:38:00,683 --> 01:38:01,726
Hank?

1160
01:38:01,809 --> 01:38:04,145
Is there anything unusual
on the radar or scanners?

1161
01:38:04,187 --> 01:38:05,813
No. Nothing.

1162
01:38:06,939 --> 01:38:10,151
Well, then he must be underwater.
And obviously, we don't have sonar.

1163
01:38:12,695 --> 01:38:15,323
- Yes, we do.
- Yes, we do.

1164
01:38:20,119 --> 01:38:21,162
They are ready for war.

1165
01:38:21,496 --> 01:38:24,123
We just need to strike another
match to light the fuse.

1166
01:38:24,415 --> 01:38:27,251
And we still have the most
powerful weapon of all.

1167
01:38:28,002 --> 01:38:29,045
Me.

1168
01:38:29,378 --> 01:38:34,300
Turn the nuclear reactor to 100% output
and make sure I'm not disturbed.

1169
01:38:37,678 --> 01:38:39,680
Hank, level the bloody plane!

1170
01:38:44,852 --> 01:38:47,146
Whoa! You back right off.

1171
01:38:48,356 --> 01:38:50,149
Beast, open the bomb bay doors!

1172
01:38:58,491 --> 01:39:01,452
Remember! This is a muscle.

1173
01:39:01,536 --> 01:39:03,162
You control it!

1174
01:39:03,204 --> 01:39:05,540
You'll be in here the entire time!

1175
01:39:05,790 --> 01:39:07,333
We'll see you soon!

1176
01:39:07,375 --> 01:39:10,878
On my mark! Three! Two!

1177
01:39:11,379 --> 01:39:13,005
One! Go!

1178
01:39:29,647 --> 01:39:31,899
Alert the fleet, they may
want to take their cans off.

1179
01:39:45,204 --> 01:39:47,748
Banshee has got a location on Shaw.

1180
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:52,420
- Are you ready for this?
- Let's find out.

1181
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:58,986
<i>Remember, the point between rage</i>

1182
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:01,447
<i>and serenity.</i>

1183
01:42:24,697 --> 01:42:25,865
Erik, take my hand!

1184
01:42:27,742 --> 01:42:30,411
Hold on, guys. It's gonna get bumpy.

1185
01:42:45,843 --> 01:42:47,219
Erik, take my hand!

1186
01:43:38,521 --> 01:43:40,147
Moira? Moira, are you all right?

1187
01:43:40,231 --> 01:43:42,024
Yeah, I'm okay.

1188
01:43:46,153 --> 01:43:47,947
I read the teleporter's mind.

1189
01:43:47,988 --> 01:43:49,949
Shaw is drawing all the power
out of his sub.

1190
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:52,076
<i>He's turning himself into
some kind of nuclear bomb.</i>

1191
01:43:52,201 --> 01:43:54,453
We got no time.
The Geiger count is going out of control.

1192
01:43:54,495 --> 01:43:55,663
Moira, this is what we're gonna do.

1193
01:43:55,704 --> 01:43:58,332
Get on the radio and tell them
to clear both fleets out immediately.

1194
01:43:58,416 --> 01:44:00,835
- I'm going in.
- Beast, Havok, back him up.

1195
01:44:00,876 --> 01:44:02,878
Erik, I can guide you through
once you're in,

1196
01:44:02,962 --> 01:44:05,423
but I need you to shut down
whatever it is that's blocking me,

1197
01:44:05,506 --> 01:44:07,508
then we just hope to God it's not
too late for me to stop him.

1198
01:44:07,591 --> 01:44:09,635
- Got it.
- Good luck!

1199
01:44:09,677 --> 01:44:11,429
- Raven, stop!
- I'm going to help them.

1200
01:44:11,512 --> 01:44:13,681
We don't have time for this.
If anything comes in that entrance,

1201
01:44:13,764 --> 01:44:16,600
- you're taking care of it, yes?
- Fine.

1202
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:34,326
Beast!

1203
01:44:37,872 --> 01:44:39,540
If we go, you go!

1204
01:44:43,085 --> 01:44:45,296
We believe Shaw is trying
to detonate some kind of bomb.

1205
01:44:50,551 --> 01:44:53,053
Erik, make for the middle of the vessel.

1206
01:44:53,095 --> 01:44:54,722
That's the point my mind can't penetrate.

1207
01:44:54,763 --> 01:44:57,016
We have to assume
that that's where Shaw is.

1208
01:45:05,816 --> 01:45:07,735
Gangway! Gangway! Gangway!

1209
01:45:14,783 --> 01:45:17,578
That's the nuclear reactor. Disable it.

1210
01:45:30,049 --> 01:45:32,009
Stop! Don't move!

1211
01:45:39,767 --> 01:45:41,060
Get down!

1212
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:06,085
<i>Erik, you're there.
You've reached the void.</i>

1213
01:46:06,126 --> 01:46:08,754
He's not here, Charles. Shaw's not here!
He's left the sub!

1214
01:46:08,963 --> 01:46:10,839
What? He's got to be there. He has to be!

1215
01:46:10,923 --> 01:46:12,633
There's nowhere else he can be.
Keep looking.

1216
01:46:12,675 --> 01:46:16,303
And I'm telling you he's not.
There's no one here, God damn it!

1217
01:46:19,348 --> 01:46:21,058
Erik.

1218
01:46:21,517 --> 01:46:22,977
What a pleasant surprise.

1219
01:46:23,060 --> 01:46:24,603
Erik? Erik.

1220
01:46:27,314 --> 01:46:29,024
So good to see you again.

1221
01:46:45,749 --> 01:46:49,003
May I ask you something?

1222
01:46:49,044 --> 01:46:50,754
Why are you on their side?

1223
01:46:50,838 --> 01:46:51,964
- He's gone.
- What?

1224
01:46:52,006 --> 01:46:54,925
He's gone into the void!
I can't communicate with him there.

1225
01:46:55,009 --> 01:46:57,595
Why fight for a doomed race
who will hunt us down

1226
01:46:57,678 --> 01:47:00,598
as soon as they realize their
reign is coming to an end?

1227
01:47:29,376 --> 01:47:31,545
Yeah! Yes!

1228
01:47:44,558 --> 01:47:46,477
I'm sorry for what happened in the camps.

1229
01:47:48,729 --> 01:47:50,564
I truly am.

1230
01:47:58,822 --> 01:48:02,076
He's back! Erik, whatever
you're doing, keep doing it.

1231
01:48:02,159 --> 01:48:04,161
<i>It's starting to work.</i>

1232
01:48:04,244 --> 01:48:07,164
But everything I did, I did for you.

1233
01:48:07,623 --> 01:48:09,291
To unlock your power,

1234
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:11,835
to make you embrace it.

1235
01:48:15,130 --> 01:48:16,298
<i>It's working!</i>

1236
01:48:16,382 --> 01:48:18,759
I'm starting to see him,
but I can't yet touch his mind.

1237
01:48:33,190 --> 01:48:35,943
You've come a long way from bending gates.

1238
01:48:36,026 --> 01:48:37,736
I'm so proud of you.

1239
01:48:45,703 --> 01:48:48,122
And you're just starting
to scratch the surface.

1240
01:48:48,539 --> 01:48:51,583
Think how much further we could go

1241
01:48:51,625 --> 01:48:53,627
together.

1242
01:49:04,179 --> 01:49:05,305
Look out!

1243
01:49:12,563 --> 01:49:14,523
Stop! Azazel.

1244
01:49:29,830 --> 01:49:34,209
I don't want to hurt you, Erik. I never did.
I want to help you.

1245
01:49:34,460 --> 01:49:36,545
This is our time.

1246
01:49:36,670 --> 01:49:38,422
Our age.

1247
01:49:39,089 --> 01:49:43,302
We are the future of the human race.

1248
01:49:43,343 --> 01:49:45,888
You and me, son.

1249
01:49:45,971 --> 01:49:48,474
This world could be ours.

1250
01:49:50,017 --> 01:49:53,979
Everything you did made me stronger.

1251
01:49:54,855 --> 01:49:57,566
It made me the weapon I am today.

1252
01:49:59,067 --> 01:50:01,069
It's the truth.

1253
01:50:02,029 --> 01:50:04,364
I've known it all along.

1254
01:50:10,037 --> 01:50:12,039
You are my creator.

1255
01:50:12,748 --> 01:50:14,249
Now, Charles!

1256
01:50:15,834 --> 01:50:17,711
- Are you okay?
- Moira, be quiet.

1257
01:50:17,753 --> 01:50:19,546
I can only control this man for so long.

1258
01:50:33,310 --> 01:50:35,020
- Sorry, Charles.
- <i>Erik, please.</i>

1259
01:50:35,312 --> 01:50:37,648
- <i>Be the better man.</i>
- It's not that I don't trust you.

1260
01:50:37,731 --> 01:50:39,525
<i>Erik, there will be no turning back!</i>

1261
01:50:40,984 --> 01:50:42,402
No!

1262
01:50:43,111 --> 01:50:44,988
- Charles!
- Don't do this, Erik!

1263
01:50:52,329 --> 01:50:53,831
If you're in there,

1264
01:50:53,914 --> 01:50:56,959
I'd like you to know that I agree
with every word you said.

1265
01:50:59,628 --> 01:51:01,630
We are the future.

1266
01:51:03,549 --> 01:51:04,591
But,

1267
01:51:06,593 --> 01:51:07,928
unfortunately,

1268
01:51:08,762 --> 01:51:11,181
you killed my mother.

1269
01:51:19,273 --> 01:51:20,774
This is what we're going to do.

1270
01:51:20,816 --> 01:51:23,193
No. Please, Erik, no.

1271
01:51:23,277 --> 01:51:27,114
I'm going to count to three and
I'm going to move the coin.

1272
01:51:29,157 --> 01:51:30,826
One.

1273
01:51:32,077 --> 01:51:33,829
Please, Erik.

1274
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:43,463
Two.

1275
01:51:49,970 --> 01:51:51,722
Three.

1276
01:52:20,125 --> 01:52:26,048
The Russians share our concerns
and will join a strike on all the mutants.

1277
01:52:26,173 --> 01:52:28,175
We can end this threat for good.

1278
01:52:28,258 --> 01:52:30,177
We'll never have another
opportunity like this.

1279
01:52:30,218 --> 01:52:32,179
We have an agent on that beach.

1280
01:52:32,262 --> 01:52:34,139
One agent.

1281
01:52:34,222 --> 01:52:35,599
She's a good agent.

1282
01:52:35,682 --> 01:52:37,851
She's collateral damage.

1283
01:52:43,357 --> 01:52:46,735
Today, our fighting stops!

1284
01:53:09,883 --> 01:53:12,386
Take off your blinders,
brothers and sisters.

1285
01:53:13,095 --> 01:53:14,888
The real enemy is out there.

1286
01:53:16,848 --> 01:53:18,892
I feel their guns moving in the water,

1287
01:53:19,351 --> 01:53:21,603
their metal targeting us.

1288
01:53:21,853 --> 01:53:24,231
Americans, Soviets,

1289
01:53:24,398 --> 01:53:25,941
humans.

1290
01:53:26,566 --> 01:53:29,152
United in their fear of the unknown.

1291
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:34,074
The Neanderthal is running scared,
my fellow mutants!

1292
01:53:36,326 --> 01:53:37,411
Go ahead, Charles.

1293
01:53:39,997 --> 01:53:41,164
Tell me I'm wrong.

1294
01:54:01,601 --> 01:54:04,438
Fleet Commander, this is X-Ray Bravo 7-0.

1295
01:54:04,479 --> 01:54:06,940
Respond. Over.

1296
01:54:07,024 --> 01:54:09,317
The beach is secure. Call off the attack.

1297
01:54:09,609 --> 01:54:12,070
The beach is targeted
and ready to be fired upon, sir.

1298
01:54:12,112 --> 01:54:14,448
- Stand by.
- Standing by, sir.

1299
01:54:14,740 --> 01:54:16,491
<font color="#ffff00">New orders. Fire on the beach.</font>

1300
01:54:18,577 --> 01:54:20,454
Hello?

1301
01:54:21,663 --> 01:54:23,623
Hello!

1302
01:54:30,464 --> 01:54:31,631
Fire!

1303
01:54:32,299 --> 01:54:33,300
<font color="#ffff00">Fire!</font>

1304
01:55:21,807 --> 01:55:24,226
Erik, you said yourself,
we're the better men.

1305
01:55:24,935 --> 01:55:26,520
This is the time to prove it.

1306
01:55:30,232 --> 01:55:32,359
There are thousands of men
on those ships.

1307
01:55:32,442 --> 01:55:34,694
Good, honest, innocent men!

1308
01:55:34,736 --> 01:55:36,530
They're just following orders.

1309
01:55:38,490 --> 01:55:40,700
I've been at the mercy of men
just following orders.

1310
01:55:45,747 --> 01:55:47,290
Never again.

1311
01:55:51,545 --> 01:55:53,004
Erik, release them!

1312
01:55:59,845 --> 01:56:01,596
No!

1313
01:56:07,686 --> 01:56:10,105
I don't want to hurt you. Don't make me!

1314
01:56:10,939 --> 01:56:12,065
Stand back!

1315
01:56:14,818 --> 01:56:16,069
Charles, that's enough!

1316
01:56:21,116 --> 01:56:22,242
Erik, stop!

1317
01:56:32,669 --> 01:56:34,880
Gentlemen, it's been an honor
serving with you.

1318
01:56:35,172 --> 01:56:37,674
<font color="#ffff00">Comrades, thank you for your service.</font>

1319
01:57:25,096 --> 01:57:26,389
I'm so sorry.

1320
01:57:26,473 --> 01:57:28,475
I said back off!

1321
01:57:29,976 --> 01:57:32,312
You. You did this.

1322
01:57:36,316 --> 01:57:38,818
Erik. Please.

1323
01:57:40,987 --> 01:57:43,990
She didn't do this, Erik.

1324
01:57:44,074 --> 01:57:46,117
You did.

1325
01:57:52,582 --> 01:57:56,253
Us turning on each other,
it's what they want.

1326
01:57:56,753 --> 01:57:59,589
I tried to warn you, Charles.

1327
01:58:01,383 --> 01:58:03,843
I want you by my side.

1328
01:58:03,927 --> 01:58:05,887
We're brothers, you and I.

1329
01:58:06,179 --> 01:58:09,391
All of us together, protecting each other.

1330
01:58:11,351 --> 01:58:13,687
We want the same thing.

1331
01:58:14,229 --> 01:58:16,189
My friend.

1332
01:58:16,648 --> 01:58:20,443
I'm sorry, but we do not.

1333
01:58:36,209 --> 01:58:40,046
Charles! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1334
01:58:40,088 --> 01:58:42,632
It's all right. It's all right.

1335
01:58:46,136 --> 01:58:48,471
This society won't accept us.

1336
01:58:49,556 --> 01:58:51,057
We form our own.

1337
01:58:51,516 --> 01:58:54,311
The humans have played their hand.

1338
01:58:56,021 --> 01:58:58,565
Now we get ready to play ours.

1339
01:59:01,026 --> 01:59:02,068
Who's with me?

1340
01:59:13,747 --> 01:59:15,123
No more hiding.

1341
01:59:43,109 --> 01:59:44,402
You should go with him.

1342
01:59:45,070 --> 01:59:46,446
It's what you want.

1343
01:59:46,946 --> 01:59:49,366
You promised me you would
never read my mind.

1344
01:59:49,783 --> 01:59:51,201
I know.

1345
01:59:51,284 --> 01:59:53,536
I promised you a great
many things, I'm afraid.

1346
01:59:54,621 --> 01:59:55,747
I'm sorry.

1347
02:00:01,086 --> 02:00:03,171
Take care of him.

1348
02:00:17,977 --> 02:00:21,106
And, Beast, never forget.

1349
02:00:21,815 --> 02:00:25,110
Mutant and proud.

1350
02:00:33,493 --> 02:00:35,286
Help me out, come on.

1351
02:00:35,787 --> 02:00:37,622
I'm gonna get you to a hospital.

1352
02:00:37,997 --> 02:00:39,416
Wait, Charles.

1353
02:00:39,499 --> 02:00:41,167
Charles, don't move, okay?

1354
02:00:41,209 --> 02:00:43,044
I won't.

1355
02:00:43,128 --> 02:00:45,004
Actually...

1356
02:00:48,299 --> 02:00:50,343
I can't feel my legs.

1357
02:00:51,344 --> 02:00:53,680
- What?
- I can't feel my legs.

1358
02:00:55,265 --> 02:00:57,308
I can't feel my legs.

1359
02:01:08,945 --> 02:01:10,697
<i>In this week of Thanksgiving</i>

1360
02:01:10,780 --> 02:01:12,782
<i>there is much for which we can be grateful</i>

1361
02:01:12,866 --> 02:01:16,327
<i>as we look back to where
we stood only four weeks ago.</i>

1362
02:01:16,369 --> 02:01:19,831
<i>The unity of this hemisphere,
the support of our allies</i>

1363
02:01:19,873 --> 02:01:22,709
<i>and the calm determination
of the American people.</i>

1364
02:01:22,792 --> 02:01:26,629
<i>These qualities may be tested
many more times in this decade.</i>

1365
02:01:29,799 --> 02:01:32,552
So, how many students do
you think you'll have here

1366
02:01:32,594 --> 02:01:34,888
once you get the academy up and running?

1367
02:01:34,971 --> 02:01:37,182
As many as I can manage.

1368
02:01:37,223 --> 02:01:39,058
Possibly more.

1369
02:01:41,686 --> 02:01:42,729
You know,

1370
02:01:43,688 --> 02:01:45,523
one day the government is going to realize

1371
02:01:45,565 --> 02:01:47,984
how lucky they were to have
Professor X on their side.

1372
02:01:49,777 --> 02:01:52,238
I suppose I am
a real professor now, aren't I?

1373
02:01:52,322 --> 02:01:53,656
Next thing you know, I'll be going bald.

1374
02:01:55,575 --> 02:01:58,077
We're still on the government's side, Moira.

1375
02:01:58,453 --> 02:02:00,705
We're still G-men. Just without the "G".

1376
02:02:01,456 --> 02:02:04,918
No. You're your own team now.

1377
02:02:05,084 --> 02:02:06,544
It's better.

1378
02:02:07,295 --> 02:02:09,547
You're X-Men.

1379
02:02:11,257 --> 02:02:13,259
Yes, I like the sound of that.

1380
02:02:14,177 --> 02:02:15,470
Moira?

1381
02:02:15,970 --> 02:02:19,849
For us, anonymity will be
the first line of defense.

1382
02:02:20,642 --> 02:02:22,101
I know.

1383
02:02:23,228 --> 02:02:27,774
They can threaten me
all they want, Charles.

1384
02:02:27,815 --> 02:02:30,693
I'll never tell them where you are.

1385
02:02:30,777 --> 02:02:32,612
Ever.

1386
02:02:32,695 --> 02:02:34,656
I know you won't.

1387
02:02:36,074 --> 02:02:37,450
I know.

1388
02:02:44,958 --> 02:02:47,794
I remember the attack on HQ,

1389
02:02:47,835 --> 02:02:50,171
leaving to go somewhere else.

1390
02:02:50,255 --> 02:02:54,300
And then this morning,
I woke up at home.

1391
02:02:54,342 --> 02:02:56,511
That's it.

1392
02:02:56,594 --> 02:03:00,098
All that time, wiped clean from your mind.
Just gone.

1393
02:03:00,723 --> 02:03:02,559
He can do that?
You don't remember anything?

1394
02:03:03,309 --> 02:03:05,603
Sometimes I get fragments.

1395
02:03:05,770 --> 02:03:07,564
Like

1396
02:03:07,647 --> 02:03:09,691
trees,

1397
02:03:09,774 --> 02:03:11,192
sunlight.

1398
02:03:13,069 --> 02:03:16,364
- A kiss.
- Oh, Jesus.

1399
02:03:16,447 --> 02:03:19,659
Gentlemen, this is why the CIA
is no place for a woman.

1400
02:03:24,580 --> 02:03:25,706
What the hell was that?

1401
02:03:42,682 --> 02:03:45,393
I know we've had our differences.

1402
02:03:47,728 --> 02:03:49,897
Where's your telepath friend?

1403
02:03:50,565 --> 02:03:52,692
Gone.

1404
02:03:52,733 --> 02:03:55,695
Left a bit of a gap in my life,
if I'm to be honest.

1405
02:03:55,736 --> 02:03:58,573
I was rather hoping you would fill it.

1406
02:04:02,869 --> 02:04:04,078
Join us.

1407
02:04:11,586 --> 02:04:12,920
Erik, I believe.

1408
02:04:16,841 --> 02:04:18,509
I prefer

1409
02:04:20,344 --> 02:04:21,971
Magneto.
