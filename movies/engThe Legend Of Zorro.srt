1
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:18,180
Brother Ignacio? What are you doing?

2
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,562
Five rings, padre.

3
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:24,569
To summon Zorro in case there's trouble.

4
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,364
If I know Zorro, he's already here.

5
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,796
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

6
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,878
Padre, what if Zorro comes?

7
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,260
I'll make sure he carves a Z on
your backside. How's that sound?

8
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,262
Really?

9
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,307
A landslide in favour of statehood.

10
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,147
Let's hope the rest of California
voted the same, huh?

11
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,107
Take this to the governor.

12
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,444
<i>Hermano</i>, be careful.
Our future's in your hands.

13
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,492
I pray that the other provinces
have been as peaceful as ours.

14
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:25,607
The latest model in heavy artillery,
the Henry repeater.

15
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:29,862
If God didn't hurl lightning,
he'd surely carry one of these.

16
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,488
State your business, McGivens.

17
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,278
I haven't voted yet.

18
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:38,537
I'm sorry, you're too late.
The polls have already closed.

19
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:42,620
Now, that doesn't seem equitable.
I have rights too.

20
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:46,879
Now, if you'd be kind enough,
hand me that box, I'll be on my way.

21
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,507
You'd only force the people to vote again.

22
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:54,545
Well, you remember that Babylon
was condemned to ashes...

23
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:58,056
...for extending its empire
to inferior races!

24
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:02,098
I come to deliver the Lord's work
against this vote.

25
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,579
Time to do the Lord's work.

26
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,718
Zorro! Zorro! Zorro!

27
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,938
Move it. Move it. Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

28
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,765
Get him!

29
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,233
Over the hill to the governor's mansion.

30
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:47,068
I said, over the hill
to the governor's mansion!

31
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,615
We really have to work on your English.

32
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:12,347
<i>Zorro! Zorro! Zorro!</i>

33
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:26,027
What happened?
Where are my men?

34
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,939
They were held up, governor.
I offered my help.

35
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,714
Citizens of San Mateo!

36
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:50,127
Today we have voted
to join the Union as a free state!

37
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,054
But this is only the beginning.
In three months...

38
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:01,142
...every vote of every pueblo
around California will be counted!

39
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:05,437
And it is my hope that we will
finally call ourselves...

40
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,477
...Americans!

41
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,454
Good boy.

42
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,512
Your saddle is getting
a little too tight, amigo.

43
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,294
Tell me we won.

44
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,538
Tell me we are free.

45
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,257
We're free.

46
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,255
- To statehood.
- To us.

47
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,595
I wish I was there today.

48
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,763
You were.

49
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,567
I cannot believe it.

50
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,069
We have our lives back.

51
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,148
Now we can take Joaquin to a trip to Spain.

52
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,113
I cannot imagine how it has changed.

53
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,993
- Elena...
- And New York.

54
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,621
You should see New York, Alejandro.

55
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:28,411
It's as if the whole world
has moved onto one tiny island.

56
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,294
Elena, I've been thinking and--

57
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,455
Never a good sign.

58
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,669
Listen, California won't really be
a state for another three months.

59
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:38,927
Yes?

60
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,805
The federal marshals may need help...

61
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,307
...keeping things under control
until then.

62
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:48,772
Look, I know what you're thinking--
Elena. Elena, listen, listen.

63
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:53,481
No, here is me, here is quitting.
We're this far apart. Elena.

64
00:14:55,978 --> 00:15:00,074
I cannot believe it.
I cannot believe I fell for it.

65
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:04,613
Husband promises to quit,
gullible wife believes him.

66
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,873
How could I be so stupid?

67
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,783
Oh, Elena, you're overreacting.

68
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,752
- I'm overreacting?
- Yes.

69
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,333
You made a promise.

70
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,794
- We made a promise.
- I know.

71
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,709
You are missing your son's entire life.

72
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,754
No, no, no. No, no, no.
I am not missing anything.

73
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,342
- Oh, really?
- Really.

74
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,382
What is his teacher's name?

75
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,393
That's an easy one.
Mister-- Brother--

76
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,772
Father Kin-- Jin-- Hoofer?

77
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,025
So I have a bad memory.
What does that prove?

78
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,686
That you do not know your own son.

79
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:40,361
And even worse, he does not know you.

80
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,363
What would you rather have me do?

81
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:45,449
Live my life as a wealthy don?
Order servants around all day?

82
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:49,616
Is that what you think I do, huh?
Order servants around all day?

83
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,535
No, no, don't twist my words.
People still need Zorro.

84
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:56,081
No, no, no. You need Zorro.

85
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,463
Look me in the eyes
and tell me that is not true.

86
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,561
You remember what you said
the day Joaquin was born?

87
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:14,641
"My family is my life."

88
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:20,154
Do you know how lucky you are
to have made it this far? Alive?

89
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,237
That your enemies have not
discovered who we are?

90
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:30,456
For 10 years, you have fought
to give California its freedom.

91
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,918
Why can't you give us ours?

92
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,925
They are calling you.

93
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:55,019
It's who I am, Elena. It's who I am.

94
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,733
What happened to the man I married?

95
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:04,365
What happened to the woman
who used to fight by my side?

96
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,151
She had a son.

97
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,283
So he'll grow up to be
a nice little aristocrat...

98
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,368
...who has no idea
where he came from...

99
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,956
...and doesn't care about anyone
but himself. Beautiful.

100
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,750
If you walk out that door,
you are not sleeping here tonight.

101
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,720
Maybe I'll just take my suitcase.

102
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,012
I hope you and Tornado
are very happy together.

103
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,802
We will be.

104
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:35,980
I love you.

105
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,300
I spy with my little eye...

106
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,808
...something beginning with H.

107
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,889
Why wasn't <i>Papi</i> at breakfast?

108
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,305
I told you. He left early on business.

109
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:01,020
He always goes on business.

110
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,896
Yes, he does.

111
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:04,944
What exactly does he do?

112
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:09,736
Well, he is a don.
And he meets with other dons...

113
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,652
...and they discuss land
and investments...

114
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,321
...and it's all very important work.

115
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,707
So he sits around with friends
counting money.

116
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:21,790
Oh, Joaquin. You should not be
so hard on your father.

117
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,546
You are more like him than you think.

118
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,463
We can talk more about this later,
all right?

119
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,011
I love you.

120
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,069
Who are you?

121
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,698
The real question,
Señora de la Vega is who are you?

122
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,201
The devoted wife of a wealthy don?

123
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:22,206
Or an independent woman held
captive by her husband's secrets?

124
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,035
What do you want?

125
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,203
Your help.

126
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,392
One?

127
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,645
I tell you, de la Vega,
women say they want one thing...

128
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,310
...but what they really want
is everything else.

129
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:53,070
Think of this as a vacation
from the shackles of matrimony.

130
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,947
Isn't it possible our wives marry us...

131
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:58,075
...because they want to spend
some time with their husbands?

132
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,906
So let me understand this.

133
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,541
If I take your advice...

134
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:09,795
...I can look forward to spending my
days pruning in a tub of naked men?

135
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:14,296
Thanks for the advice. But no.

136
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,466
Where are you going?

137
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,968
To beg Elena's forgiveness.

138
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,099
Goodness me.

139
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,436
Might one of you be
Don Alejandro de la Vega?

140
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:27,263
Yes.

141
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:32,944
Phineas Gendler, attorney at law.
I'm here on behalf of your wife.

142
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:36,732
If you should have any questions,
my address is on the letterhead.

143
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,274
Good day, sir.

144
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,908
Gentlemen.

145
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,765
I'm sorry, señor.

146
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:15,436
But you told me to make sure
you didn't sleep past 2 today.

147
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,487
- What's today?
- Wednesday.

148
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:24,320
Of course.
I have to pick up Joaquin.

149
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,748
What happened to my clothes?

150
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:31,502
I removed them last night
so you wouldn't catch pneumonia.

151
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,462
You removed them?

152
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:37,501
After you came back from the cantina,
you went for a swim.

153
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:39,752
In my clothes?

154
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,928
- This hotel doesn't have a pool.
- We have a fountain.

155
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,519
I see. Well, thank you, Lupe.

156
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,931
Perhaps you just can turn around, eh?

157
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,940
I'll see you at confession, my child.

158
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:07,367
Don't look at me like that.
I know what you're gonna say.

159
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,874
No. No, I came here to lift
your spirits, not to dampen them.

160
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,660
Who said my spirit needed lifting?

161
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,380
Alejandro, you are being
a pig-headed fool.

162
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,540
Why don't you just tell Elena
you were wrong.

163
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,880
She's the one who wanted me to live a lie.

164
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,716
To stop being myself.

165
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,222
As if California could live without me.

166
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:28,100
Wake up. I haven't had to
ring that bell in three months.

167
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,727
- You should be rejoicing.
- I am rejoicing!

168
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,935
All right. You cannot
rot in this room forever.

169
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:37,068
A vineyard is opening tonight.
You're coming to the party with me.

170
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:39,775
My whole life is a party.
Thank you, no.

171
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,314
Be at the lobby at 8.

172
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,984
Or don't bother coming to confession,
because I'll never forgive you.

173
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,699
You'd blackmail my soul, eh?

174
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:51,073
Hell, yes.

175
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,671
Now...

176
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,128
...would anyone else
like to interrupt my lecture...

177
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,839
...by asking to go to the bathroom?

178
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:05,296
No.

179
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,592
Who can tell me what this word means?

180
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,601
Joaquin?

181
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,063
Joaquin de la Vega!

182
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:25,525
Perhaps you can tell the class
what statehood means to you.

183
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:31,614
No more exploitation
of the peasants by the rich...

184
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,785
...who oppress us
with a flaming poker of injustice.

185
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:39,956
And how exactly does a flaming poker
fit into your little theory?

186
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,083
It fits...

187
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,631
...in your butt.

188
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,313
Now I will give you something
to laugh about.

189
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,479
Come here.

190
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,904
No?

191
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,171
<i>Joaquin! Joaquin! Joaquin!</i>

192
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,364
Get back inside!

193
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,329
Joaquin.

194
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,581
So, what's with you, huh?

195
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,375
You're lucky Father Quintero
didn't throw you out for good.

196
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:10,713
Stop making excuses.
Why do you keep picking fights?

197
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,974
You don't understand.
Sometimes you have to fight.

198
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,181
Oh, really? Says who?

199
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,560
Says him.

200
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:26,112
Listen, if Zorro were here, he'd tell you
fighting isn't always the answer.

201
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:28,189
How do you know what he'd say'?

202
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,608
Trust me, I know him a lot better
than you think.

203
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:33,744
No, you don't.
You never been in a fight in your life.

204
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,529
You didn't even fight to keep Mom.

205
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,416
I am your father, little man.
Don't talk to me like that.

206
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:43,421
There's nothing on earth I wouldn't do
for you or your mother. Understand?

207
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:45,714
Don Alejandro.

208
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,545
Don Alejandro.

209
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,752
Guillermo.

210
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,134
- Blanca.
- Hello.

211
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,265
Look at little José. Poor thing.

212
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,430
He's as ugly as his mother.

213
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,855
Look at Joaquin.
You're growing up so fast.

214
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:09,864
If business keeps up, we'll be able to
pay you back sooner than we thought.

215
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,775
I told you, it was a gift.
To celebrate your son's birth.

216
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:17,117
Hey, señor.
That knife is only 2 dollars.

217
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:23,202
Well, I'll give you 500 for it.

218
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,963
And for that, I'll take the deed to your
rancho, with the Lord's gratitude.

219
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:30,126
We've already told you, we'll never sell.

220
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:36,432
Family man like you might wanna
keep his woman on a shorter leash.

221
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,808
They said they are not selling, sir.

222
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,315
Have we met before, sir?

223
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,898
I would remember a man with wooden teeth.

224
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,944
And I'd remember a Mex-breed
dressed like a white man.

225
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:57,115
You think your pappy's gonna crow,
little man? Or is he gonna cluck?

226
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,324
Leave him out of--

227
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:08,505
Señor, as a gentleman, I am obliged
to teach my son to turn the 0--

228
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:11,000
You mean that cheek?

229
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,668
Is everything all right, boys?

230
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,880
Respects to you, officer.

231
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,008
Respects, respects.

232
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:27,900
Think about my offer, or I'll
be obliged to do the Lord's work.

233
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,983
Ten minutes, then I'm going.

234
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,025
Effervescent, yet tenacious.

235
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,535
I thought you were forbidden to drink.
What the--?

236
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:23,117
I need at least one vice
to keep in touch with sinners.

237
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,578
Whatever.
Who owns this vineyard anyway?

238
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:28,585
A count recently in from France.

239
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:31,338
I'm told he purchased it
from Don Gallo's widow.

240
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,839
French count, you say?

241
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,672
He's probably still in his parlour
putting on makeup.

242
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:37,844
Or his perfume, perhaps.

243
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,932
Rumour has it they invented it
to avoid bathing.

244
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:46,182
And you are...?

245
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:49,769
De la Vega. Alejandro de la Vega.

246
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,150
You're de la Vega.

247
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:55,188
What an honour.
I've heard so much about you.

248
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,402
Really? From whom?

249
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,992
You know, I'd love to
continue this conversation...

250
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:04,030
...but I'm wanted elsewhere.
Please excuse me.

251
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,139
I just met the most charming fellow.

252
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,599
And who might that be?

253
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:32,604
Ladies and gentlemen! Welcome.

254
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,444
I still don't know why
they call it a wine tasting.

255
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,650
After two glasses you can't taste anything.

256
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,654
Friends, Californians.

257
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:46,744
This vineyard represents what I hope
will become an industry...

258
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,000
...that depends on the people
for its success.

259
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:53,162
Involving them instead of exploiting them.

260
00:31:57,499 --> 00:32:01,049
That's what America means to me.

261
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:05,762
The promise of a country
by the people, for the people!

262
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,524
A country blessed with limitless beauty.

263
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:19,022
But none more stunning
than my escort for the evening.

264
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,197
Ladies and gentlemen...

265
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,233
...Señora Elena de la Vega!

266
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,570
Well, I'm pooped.
Come on, let's go.

267
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,239
Go?

268
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:14,410
I don't wanna go.
I'm having so much fun.

269
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,913
Monsieur and Madame Lupon.

270
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,377
- Pleasure, madame.
- Thank you.

271
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:22,547
Very nice to meet you.

272
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,262
- Alejandro.
- Elena.

273
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:29,262
- Armand.
- De la Vega.

274
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,511
- Count.
- You know each other?

275
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,935
We shared a giggle at the buffet table.

276
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,940
It seems that's not all we have shared.

277
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,486
Allow me to defuse an awkward situation.

278
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:44,489
Elena has portrayed you as a man
of impeccable character.

279
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:46,571
I am honoured to be mentioned at all.

280
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:50,078
Why, I nearly forgot we were still
married only three months ago.

281
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:52,285
A blessing on your vineyard, count.

282
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,575
Thank you for inviting us,
but we have a Mass--

283
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:58,541
Don't be rude, Felipe. I'm just dying
to know how the lovebirds met.

284
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:07,513
Another time.
We have many guests to greet.

285
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,594
Armand, good evening.

286
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,761
Governor Riley.
You honour us with your presence.

287
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:15,474
May I present my wife, Mary.

288
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:18,106
Your speech was incredibly moving, count.

289
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:21,610
I'm glad you're not running for office
against my husband.

290
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:25,780
I wouldn't challenge the man who's
going to lead California into the Union.

291
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:29,409
I fear there may not be
much of a Union left to join, governor.

292
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,570
Everyone, may I introduce...

293
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,956
...Colonel R.S. Beauregard,
of the 1st Alabama Infantry.

294
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:36,583
What brings you here, colonel?

295
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,584
The threat of civil war, my dear.

296
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:42,668
Once California joins the Union, the
Confederate states'll be outnumbered.

297
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:45,592
My countrymen find that troubling.

298
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:49,380
All this talk of politics, you know how
it bores me, Armand. Shall we dance?

299
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:51,890
Of course. Excuse us, gentlemen.

300
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:55,560
Ladies and gentlemen,
the imperial quadrille.

301
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,693
Perhaps you shouldn't drink
on an empty stomach.

302
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:10,860
Perhaps you should wear lipstick
if you're gonna act like my mother.

303
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,879
Say the word and I'll escort you home.

304
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:26,133
- And leave your guests?
- In a heartbeat.

305
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:30,762
I care for you too much to subject you
to an evening of forced smiles, Elena.

306
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:36,059
You. You are the one
not acting like yourself.

307
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,685
Since when do politics bore you?

308
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,438
Since when did you start caring
what I think?

309
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,731
You.

310
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:48,735
If you wish, I'll have him escorted out.

311
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,570
I can handle him.

312
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,153
For the love of God,
let's get out of this place.

313
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,866
I can handle her!

314
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:00,875
You must tell me how you met.

315
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:04,629
Years ago, in Spain. We were
at finishing school together.

316
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:07,507
Oh, how nice.
You were reunited so he could finish.

317
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,168
Don't force me to embarrass you.

318
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,881
Sorry, too late!

319
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:20,892
So tell me, count, what does
your title rank among noblemen?

320
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:22,897
It is higher than, say, a duke?

321
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,735
Oh, it's rather common, actually.
Much like a don.

322
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:35,198
Oh, he's a delight.
Rich, good-looking and royalty.

323
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,158
Is there anything I can say
to make you leave?

324
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,789
You can fall to your knees
and beg me to take you back.

325
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,450
I would not want to ruin my dress.

326
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,870
- Good. I'm enjoying single life.
- Is that supposed to make me jealous?

327
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,037
- Does it?
- Never!

328
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,174
Who's looking after Joaquin while
his mother spends her nights out?

329
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,881
I have not spent my nights out.
I haven't even told Joaquin!

330
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,465
Now, I think you should go!

331
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:54,845
- You know...
- Let me go!

332
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,802
I finally understand why you left me.

333
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:59,388
It was beneath you to marry
a peasant like me.

334
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,849
- You're drunk.
- Your stepfather would be so proud...

335
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,810
...to see you take your rightful place
on the arms of royalty!

336
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,601
- Keep your voice down!
- Congratulations, Your Highness!

337
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:23,033
If you didn't know me better than that,
then you never knew me at all.

338
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,679
No.

339
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,972
Thank you...

340
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,688
...for your hospitality, count.

341
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:27,013
Could you--? Could you--?
Could you--?

342
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,057
Could you give me that back?

343
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:34,479
Hey, hey! Cut it out!
You had enough.

344
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,491
Stinky...

345
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:52,081
Aren't you forgetting something, <i>estúpido?!</i>

346
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,179
Count Armand...

347
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:03,842
...with his fancy wine
and the froufrou accent.

348
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,682
How could Elena choose a man like that?

349
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:11,976
I'll make her want me back so badly,
she will be weeping with desire.

350
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:16,271
Nobody leaves my tequila worm
dangling in the wind!

351
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,378
Oh, my God.

352
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:12,827
Thank you.

353
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:20,343
God bless you, señor.

354
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,716
How kind of you.

355
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,511
I was trying to impress you.

356
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:32,264
If you truly want to impress me,
invite me over for dinner tonight.

357
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:35,020
Cook me something sinful.

358
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:39,028
Why not dine at your hacienda?
I'd really like to meet your son.

359
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,443
Please try and understand, Armand.

360
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,359
He's not ready for another man
in my life just yet.

361
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,782
Of course. I understand.

362
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:49,531
What is it?

363
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,119
Oh, this hat. It's breathtaking.

364
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,962
Shall I purchase it for you?

365
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:03,212
On second thought, who needs another hat?

366
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,171
What I need is...

367
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,720
...a pipe!

368
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,226
- A Pipe?
- A Pipe.

369
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,058
Like my father used to smoke.

370
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,064
I hope I do not repulse you
with my unladylike habit.

371
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:17,976
No, no. On the contrary,
you fascinate me.

372
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,028
Oh, there's a vendor.

373
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:22,526
Wait here, won't you?

374
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:30,242
What are you doing here?

375
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:32,032
When did you start smoking a pipe?

376
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:35,418
I don't smoke. I said that to
get rid of him so I can get rid of you.

377
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,546
- I have to talk to you about last night.
- I forgive you. Goodbye.

378
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:40,707
No, no, no, not that. After.

379
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,839
- I saw something in the forest.
- What are you talking about?

380
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,596
Yes, what are you talking about?

381
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:51,726
An explosion.
Close to your chateau, in fact.

382
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,602
Like nothing I have ever seen.

383
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:57,774
I simply wanted to make sure
you were both safe.

384
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:59,976
As much as you had to drink last night...

385
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:02,521
...I'm sure your vision was impaired.

386
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,694
Yet somehow it's all becoming clear.

387
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:09,407
A word of advice, de la Vega:

388
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:13,452
If you have any respect for the
relationship you shared with Elena...

389
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,457
...let it die with dignity.

390
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:18,791
I have to know I am losing her
to a better man.

391
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,125
I can assure you of that.

392
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,623
All right, that is enough.

393
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,293
- Alejandro, time to go.
- Elena, please.

394
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:30,136
Alejandro has come for peace of mind.
I am obliged to give it to him.

395
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:33,805
Perhaps we can settle this like gentlemen.

396
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,808
You do play polo, I take it?

397
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,015
Doesn't everyone?

398
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,602
I suggest we play as they do in Slovenia.

399
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,988
- A fine city.
- Country.

400
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:46,982
Naturally.

401
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:55,953
- May I offer you something to drink?
- Double tequila, no salt.

402
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:18,013
Perhaps a game of croquet would be
less hazardous to your health.

403
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:48,677
Did you drop something?
Or you just resting?

404
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:52,927
You know, I think I like this game.

405
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:55,467
Promise me when you lose
you will leave us alone.

406
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,226
What makes you think I will lose?

407
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,137
Woman's intuition.

408
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:46,188
To the victor go the spoils.

409
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:52,281
Now keep your promise and go.

410
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,113
You cheated, so I take it back.

411
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:55,944
Goodbye, Alejandro.

412
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,454
What do you really know about this man?

413
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,460
We were never meant to be together.

414
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,802
You don't love him.

415
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:17,966
After 10 years of marriage,
you cannot hide the truth from me.

416
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:34,816
De la Cruz is the bartender who works
at the saloon across the street.

417
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:39,158
He says he overheard McGivens
gathering his men to go see Cortez.

418
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,714
Your father asked me to pick--

419
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,625
Cortez!

420
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,758
The deed, if you please.

421
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:42,903
- Bring it here.
- No, Guillermo, don't!

422
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:46,781
Please, señor.
This land is all we have.

423
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:51,123
And the Lord shall expel them before you...

424
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:54,038
...and ye shall possess their land!

425
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:00,844
Salvation...

426
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,717
...damnation.

427
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,306
Got one thing in common.
You gotta die to find either one.

428
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:08,890
How true.

429
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,766
Drop your guns.

430
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,812
All of you!

431
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:25,661
Guillermo, Blanca, get in the house.

432
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:37,669
You are one blind Mexican. You don't
know what you're getting yourself into.

433
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:39,963
Neither do you.

434
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:47,929
Shoot him!

435
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:50,015
Let him be!

436
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:03,866
- Come on!
- Let's move!

437
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,064
Don't let them hurt you.

438
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,195
I won't. I promise.

439
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,763
Go on! Break it down!

440
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:06,215
Blanca.

441
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:07,875
Blanca.

442
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:41,208
No! Guillermo!

443
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:46,919
Guillermo! Guillermo.

444
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,174
Guillermo.

445
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,802
Guillermo, please talk to me.

446
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:56,136
Talk to me!

447
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:57,595
Please!

448
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:21,035
What are you trying to tell me, huh?

449
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,792
No matter what choice I make,
it's always the wrong one!

450
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:25,794
I have failed everyone I ever loved.

451
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:28,206
My wife, my son and now the people too!

452
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:30,045
What do you want from me?!

453
00:53:43,095 --> 00:53:44,642
Help me.

454
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:47,858
I have always listened to my heart.

455
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:51,395
And it speaks to me now
of a great darkness.

456
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:55,069
I fear Guillermo Cortez
was only the beginning...

457
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,326
...and that Elena
is in great danger too.

458
00:53:58,277 --> 00:54:00,029
Sol beg you...

459
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:04,416
...give me the courage,
the strength...

460
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:07,666
...to wear the mask a little longer.

461
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:11,832
Allow Zorro one last ride.

462
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:52,706
Come here.

463
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:04,225
She's going to the vineyard.

464
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:07,388
We can post men near the gate
in case we have to pull her out.

465
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:11,191
If she's compromised,
she's of no further use.

466
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:14,695
Consider her an acceptable loss.

467
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:42,632
Master, a word?

468
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:46,306
Please, excuse me a moment.

469
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:53,859
The shipment arrives at Maderas Cove.

470
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:08,661
The carving is beautiful.

471
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:11,118
And what is through that door?

472
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:13,454
Private chapel.

473
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:17,291
Piety is a long-standing tradition
in my family.

474
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:20,461
I'd show it to you, but dinner's waiting.

475
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:42,611
That was absolutely delicious.

476
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:45,861
And now...

477
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:49,032
Oh, no, I'm sorry, Marie, I do not smoke.

478
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:53,828
Unless it is my pipe, of course.

479
00:56:56,496 --> 00:57:00,000
Oh, you remembered.
How thoughtful.

480
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:03,922
But I think I should let
my stomach settle first.

481
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,308
Elena.

482
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,853
I want to ask you something.

483
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:15,353
Something I should've asked you
many years ago.

484
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:21,030
Before you do, my love,
answer me one question.

485
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:23,323
Whatever your heart desires.

486
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:29,121
Where is the bathroom?
I would like to powder my cheeks.

487
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:33,910
Of course. Down the hall.

488
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:35,915
Excuse me.

489
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:14,371
Excuse me, sir.
A gentleman is here to see you.

490
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,460
He says it's important.

491
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,467
He's building a track to the vineyard.

492
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,018
I presume you have the deed...

493
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:25,984
...since you deemed it necessary
to interrupt my dinner.

494
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:27,489
Right here.

495
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:30,025
But it seems we have a fly in the ointment.

496
00:59:30,192 --> 00:59:32,445
Or should I say a fox. Zorro.

497
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:35,038
I've heard the name among the locals.

498
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:38,667
He's a peasant masquerading as a folk hero.

499
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:42,205
Men like that usually find their way
to the guillotine.

500
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:54,718
I've been informed one of my
shipping vessels is arriving tomorrow.

501
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:57,056
They'll anchor off Maderas Cove.

502
00:59:57,219 --> 01:00:00,519
The cargo must be brought here safely.

503
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:03,350
I want no mistakes.

504
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:26,040
Now that we have the deed,
will the track be completed on time?

505
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:29,210
It'll take my boys two days
to cover the quarter mile.

506
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:34,306
I'll hold you to that, Mr. McGivens.
Otherwise you get nothing.

507
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:39,060
Listen to me,
you backwards-ass frog...

508
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:41,722
...you hedge on my money,
you won't ever see me 00--

509
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:48,900
This dagger, Mr. McGivens...

510
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:50,738
.“Jake“.

511
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,991
...Has been in my family
for generations.

512
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:56,741
If you ever talk to me like that again...

513
01:00:56,903 --> 01:01:01,249
...I will cut out your tongue
and I'll feed it to my dogs.

514
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:03,877
Understood?

515
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:17,803
Your men have two days,
Mr. McGivens...

516
01:01:17,966 --> 01:01:20,185
...then the future begins.

517
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:23,559
I trust you can find your own way out.

518
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:33,740
"Received word of
successful explosive test."

519
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:44,622
<i>"Orbis unum."</i>

520
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:09,415
Alejandro! For God's sake,
why can't you leave me alone?

521
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:12,831
Elena, I was right.
Armand is not who you think he is.

522
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:15,547
- You have no idea who I think he is.
- I think I know.

523
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:18,553
No, because you do not think.
Get out before somebody sees you.

524
01:03:18,712 --> 01:03:20,214
Elena, listen to me.

525
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:23,224
- Guillermo Cortez is dead.
- What?

526
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:25,306
Armand needed his land
to build a rail road.

527
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,061
He's planning something.

528
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,938
How do you know this?

529
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:32,317
Oh, no. I won't tell you what I know
until you tell me what you know.

530
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:36,070
If you wanna know, I need to know why
you are living in sin with an evil count!

531
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:37,446
Elena?

532
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,027
Elena?

533
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:51,044
There you are.

534
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:58,886
Forgive me, Armand. I just had the
sudden urge to step out for a puff.

535
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:03,257
Are you all right?

536
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:05,015
Fine.

537
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:06,893
My God, you're turning green.

538
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:13,608
It's just your presence
takes my breath away.

539
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:21,025
Good, because I have
a little something for you.

540
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:24,782
A customary Spanish offering...

541
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:29,909
...for when a man asks a woman
for her hand in marriage.

542
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,959
Let me do this on one knee
so I can look up into your eyes.

543
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:39,296
Oh, no, don't look up.

544
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,145
Is that a yes?

545
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:57,106
It's a definite maybe.

546
01:04:57,268 --> 01:05:01,023
I know it's sudden, given what
you've just been through...

547
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:06,862
...but I want to give you everything
your former husband couldn't.

548
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:09,789
You don't have to answer now...

549
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:15,166
...but whatever you decide,
the necklace is yours.

550
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:17,505
Thank you.

551
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:22,798
But I have to go.
I must put Joaquin to bed.

552
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:28,179
Of course.
Your children require attention.

553
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:45,491
Pearls.

554
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:18,275
Welcome, children, to Bear Point.

555
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:20,769
It was on this desolate spot...

556
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:24,565
...that our state flag
was raised for the first time.

557
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:28,531
Tomorrow our governor will be
hosting a celebration here...

558
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:31,242
...to honour California's statehood.

559
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:33,782
Joaquin de la Vega!

560
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:35,746
Are you paying attention?

561
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:40,079
Take out your notebooks--

562
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:55,929
Hold up.

563
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:16,412
Scorcher of a day, ain't it, kids?

564
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:26,551
Is there something
I can help you with, señor?

565
01:07:27,085 --> 01:07:29,679
Don't let me interrupt the lesson, Father.

566
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:32,681
I'm just on my way to do the Lord's work.

567
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:36,306
Mount up, boys.

568
01:07:40,765 --> 01:07:42,267
Come on.

569
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:19,019
Grab that there, will you?

570
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:48,924
Let's get to work, boys.

571
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,137
All right!

572
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:34,925
What are you doing here?

573
01:09:35,213 --> 01:09:38,934
Looking at two of the ugliest guys
I've ever seen.

574
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:56,609
Come on.
Do you want a piece of me?

575
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:45,659
Stay there!

576
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:55,669
<i>Orbis unum.</i>

577
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:20,534
I can't believe it's you.
You're really Zorro.

578
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,240
And that's Tornado, right?

579
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:25,998
I mean, whoa.
Look at him. He's huge.

580
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,338
It's just a scratch.

581
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:37,047
So you gonna say something or what?

582
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:40,255
Let's speak in Spanish,
the language of our fathers.

583
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:42,298
My mother won't believe this!

584
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:45,889
No, it would be better if you didn't
tell your mother about this.

585
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:47,304
Why not?

586
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:49,814
I'm the one asking the questions.

587
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:51,394
Now, why aren't you in school?

588
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:53,559
The man with the scar on his face.

589
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:55,273
I knew he was up to something.

590
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:57,404
You really showed that son of a bitch.

591
01:11:57,772 --> 01:11:59,866
Watch your mouth.

592
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:02,451
Those men are killers.

593
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:04,908
Whatever they had in those crates
was very dangerous...

594
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:07,915
...and now I don't know what it was, as I
was too busy getting you out of trouble.

595
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:12,704
You mean this?

596
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:17,751
Soap?!

597
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:19,676
That's all there was?

598
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:20,962
Lots and lots of it.

599
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:22,254
Are you sure?

600
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:24,094
Would I lie to you?

601
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:30,225
Spanish, niño, Spanish,
and this isn't a game.

602
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:33,562
Your father would have a heart attack
if he knew what you did.

603
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,102
No, he wouldn't, he doesn't care.

604
01:12:37,144 --> 01:12:39,693
Yesterday he forgot about me.

605
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:45,404
No, I don't think he forgot.

606
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:49,206
What you have to understand is...

607
01:12:52,076 --> 01:12:53,498
No.

608
01:12:54,245 --> 01:12:56,293
Your father should have been there.

609
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:58,833
Next time he will be.

610
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,798
How do you know?

611
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,422
I know.

612
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:06,178
I promise.

613
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:20,526
A serpent circling the globe.

614
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:23,821
Are you sure that this is the symbol
you saw on the crate?

615
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:27,487
<i>"Orbis unum."</i> Yeah.

616
01:13:27,862 --> 01:13:30,661
It's Latin. It means "one world."

617
01:13:31,157 --> 01:13:33,376
It represents the Knights of Aragon...

618
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:37,038
...an ancient brotherhood that ruled
Europe in secrecy after the Crusades.

619
01:13:37,204 --> 01:13:39,957
Wait, wait, wait.
Armand is a knight?

620
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:44,804
Some believe they are the masters
behind all the kings in Europe...

621
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:46,589
...even today.

622
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:51,181
Here is a prophecy they wrote
nearly 1000 years ago.

623
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:55,557
"There shall be a land in the west
of great power...

624
01:13:55,723 --> 01:13:59,068
...that shall rise to threaten
the serpent.

625
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:03,777
Only by turning the power onto itself
shall the serpent survive."

626
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:08,444
A land in the west.

627
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:10,496
America.

628
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:13,699
They want to destroy it.

629
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:16,794
- With soap?
- With soap?

630
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,393
Thank you.

631
01:14:33,511 --> 01:14:35,479
I had a wonderful time.

632
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:37,891
Unfortunate that it has to end.

633
01:14:38,057 --> 01:14:39,479
It does?

634
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:43,146
Some colleagues of mine are arriving
from Europe this evening.

635
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:44,905
The meeting may run late.

636
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:49,577
Perhaps we could meet for breakfast?

637
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:52,322
I cannot wait that long.

638
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:56,250
I want to be your wife, Armand.

639
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,343
If I am going to be
the lady of the house...

640
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:16,262
...I want to start making myself
at home.

641
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:23,774
I suppose we could have a late supper.

642
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:28,775
I will wait for you after your meeting.

643
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:33,116
Then perhaps I can stay.

644
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:35,633
Excuse me.

645
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:47,149
Sir! Sir! Hotel Vista Grande.

646
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,154
What the--?

647
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:14,546
Who are you?

648
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,303
I'm Agent Pike.
This is Agent Harrigan.

649
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:21,220
We're the Pinkertons. Operatives
of the United States government.

650
01:17:22,388 --> 01:17:24,061
So you are the good guys?

651
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:26,897
We live in perilous times,
Mr. de la Vega.

652
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:29,528
America's gates have been
thrown wide open...

653
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:31,405
...to people from foreign lands.

654
01:17:31,564 --> 01:17:34,363
Which is why, on occasion,
we require certain individuals...

655
01:17:34,525 --> 01:17:37,153
...to aid in our country's defence.

656
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:38,741
People like your ex-wife.

657
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:43,576
Elena?

658
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:48,876
Works for you?

659
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:51,588
As a spy?

660
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:54,587
Until California's statehood
becomes official...

661
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:57,597
...we don't have jurisdiction to serve
Armand with a search warrant.

662
01:17:57,756 --> 01:17:59,929
So we needed someone
who could gain his trust.

663
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:03,266
And who more suited to the task
than the woman he never forgot?

664
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:05,477
Before he arrived,
we intercepted a telegram...

665
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:08,108
...he'd dispatched to his associates
throughout Europe.

666
01:18:08,267 --> 01:18:10,520
In that telegram,
he claimed to be on the verge...

667
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:12,609
...of producing a new weapon...

668
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:15,069
...with a single target in mind.

669
01:18:15,316 --> 01:18:17,614
The United States of America.

670
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:22,243
What kind of weapon could do that?

671
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:25,080
Your ex-wife may be on the verge
to answer that question.

672
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:28,963
And every time you interfere, you
jeopardise her cover. Understand?

673
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:34,043
The divorce was your idea, wasn't it?

674
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:37,214
You blackmailed Elena
to lure in the count--

675
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:40,974
We prefer to think of it
as a mutual understanding.

676
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,098
She agrees to help us...

677
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:47,390
...and we promise to keep the name
of Zorro secret from his enemies.

678
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:50,651
A name you share with your wife and son.

679
01:18:58,692 --> 01:19:00,945
I know something that might help you.

680
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,679
I will send you both to hell for this!

681
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:28,356
Our country must be protected,
de la Vega, without apology.

682
01:19:29,348 --> 01:19:31,442
Zorro is a relic of the past.

683
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:34,649
This belongs in a museum.

684
01:19:35,312 --> 01:19:36,985
So do you.

685
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:45,743
Soon we will both be free.

686
01:20:38,959 --> 01:20:41,883
<i>Bonsoir</i>, Marie.
Armand is expecting me.

687
01:20:42,046 --> 01:20:45,391
You are early, madame.
The count is still indisposed.

688
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:48,428
Well, perhaps I can wait in the parlour.

689
01:21:00,147 --> 01:21:01,945
Thank you so much, Marie.

690
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:42,152
Joaquin? Joaquin!

691
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:44,483
Hey! Hey! Come here.

692
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:46,151
Dad?

693
01:21:50,614 --> 01:21:51,991
What are you doing in a bar?

694
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:54,330
- What are you doing in jail?
- I asked you first.

695
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:56,916
I went looking everywhere for you.
It's about Mom.

696
01:21:57,079 --> 01:22:00,049
- Is she okay?
- No. I mean, yes, but no.

697
01:22:00,207 --> 01:22:01,584
A man came to the house.

698
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:04,003
He asked her to marry him.
She said yes.

699
01:22:04,169 --> 01:22:07,343
I know you still love her.
You said you'd do anything for her.

700
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:11,261
You can't be in jail! How can you be
in jail?! You gotta stop her.

701
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:13,225
Joaquin. Joaquin, listen to me.

702
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:17,688
Help me out of here,
and I'll get your mother back.

703
01:22:18,892 --> 01:22:20,815
We'll be a family again.

704
01:22:22,396 --> 01:22:24,148
I promise.

705
01:22:26,859 --> 01:22:30,033
I promise. Now--

706
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:25,377
Joaquin. Joaquin.
You are a genius, a genius.

707
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:28,421
But I don't want to catch you
breaking anyone out of jail again.

708
01:23:28,587 --> 01:23:30,510
Without my permission, I mean.

709
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:54,863
Stay back! Or I break the kid's neck!

710
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:59,957
Help me! I'm too young to die!
I got my whole life ahead of me!

711
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:04,373
Kill him.

712
01:24:21,139 --> 01:24:22,982
Where did you learn to do that?

713
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:27,233
Prison changes a man, son.
Let's go.

714
01:24:47,624 --> 01:24:49,342
Listen, Joaquin.

715
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:52,258
- I have to go alone.
- What?

716
01:24:52,546 --> 01:24:54,469
I just got you out of jail!

717
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:56,008
What if he puts up a fight?

718
01:24:56,174 --> 01:24:58,973
I'm not going there to fight.
I am going to reason with him.

719
01:24:59,136 --> 01:25:00,353
You can't reason with him.

720
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:03,641
Joaquin, the world is a little more
complicated than you think.

721
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:05,684
No, it isn't.
There's right and wrong.

722
01:25:05,851 --> 01:25:08,855
I don't have the time to argue with you.

723
01:25:10,856 --> 01:25:12,574
I'm sorry.

724
01:25:13,317 --> 01:25:14,990
Come, Joaquincito.

725
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:21,374
You don't deserve Mom.

726
01:25:43,722 --> 01:25:45,975
Yeah. We're to stay put.

727
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,642
Armand went through there.
We have to hurry.

728
01:27:10,809 --> 01:27:12,982
- I know about the Pinkertons.
- How?

729
01:27:13,145 --> 01:27:14,988
It doesn't matter.
They told me everything.

730
01:27:15,147 --> 01:27:16,569
It's all right, I forgive you.

731
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:18,780
You forgive me'? No, no.
I forgive you. You!

732
01:27:18,942 --> 01:27:20,660
- For what?
- Everything you put me through.

733
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:24,164
You? I would not be in this mess
if you had kept your mask on.

734
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:26,620
Really? Then why are you
still wearing his necklace?

735
01:27:26,783 --> 01:27:28,330
I'm undercover.

736
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:31,918
Besides, these are pearls.
You never gave me pearls.

737
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:35,300
- You said you didn't care about that.
- I lied. Every woman loves pearls.

738
01:27:35,459 --> 01:27:37,427
Well, now you have them, princess.

739
01:27:37,878 --> 01:27:41,303
When I said that we were never
meant to be together, I meant it.

740
01:27:41,673 --> 01:27:43,675
Finally we agree on something.

741
01:27:54,352 --> 01:27:57,572
- This changes nothing.
- Absolutely not.

742
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:01,489
- Follow me.
- Always.

743
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:10,286
<i>Orbis unum.</i>

744
01:28:10,827 --> 01:28:12,625
<i>Orbis unum.</i>

745
01:28:12,871 --> 01:28:15,374
Fellow Knights of Aragon...

746
01:28:15,874 --> 01:28:21,347
...soon the power of the United States
will be so great...

747
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:24,724
...it will overshadow us.

748
01:28:26,051 --> 01:28:30,181
But America has one weakness:

749
01:28:32,015 --> 01:28:33,358
Its people.

750
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:37,062
They are divided by North and South.

751
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:40,073
A civil war is inevitable.

752
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:43,406
The only question is,
who will claim victory?

753
01:28:44,194 --> 01:28:47,414
We will determine the outcome...

754
01:28:50,075 --> 01:28:51,201
...with this:

755
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:53,912
An average bar of soap.

756
01:28:54,704 --> 01:28:57,924
Quite harmless in its current form.

757
01:28:58,416 --> 01:29:03,593
But science has shown us
how to extract the glycerine...

758
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:06,550
...and transform it
into a compound...

759
01:29:06,716 --> 01:29:10,437
...13 times more powerful
than gunpowder.

760
01:29:13,557 --> 01:29:15,184
Nitroglycerin.

761
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:22,108
For months, this vineyard has been
a cover for its manufacture.

762
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:26,403
Tomorrow, a shipment of nitro
will depart by train.

763
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:29,574
It will be met at the state line
by Colonel Beauregard...

764
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:31,992
...who will take possession
of the shipment...

765
01:29:32,158 --> 01:29:35,628
...and distribute it throughout
the Confederate Army.

766
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:37,623
As we speak...

767
01:29:37,956 --> 01:29:39,458
...they're preparing to launch...

768
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:42,298
...a preemptive strike
against Washington...

769
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:46,640
...forever tearing this country apart.

770
01:29:48,925 --> 01:29:53,101
Gentlemen, the Knights of Aragon...

771
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:56,479
...will soon be restored
to our former glory...

772
01:29:56,641 --> 01:30:00,987
...as we stand in shadow and watch
America destroy itself!

773
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:02,605
I've heard enough.

774
01:30:04,107 --> 01:30:06,485
Brothers, you know my spirit is with you.

775
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:09,780
But we risk antagonizing
a sleeping giant if we fail.

776
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:12,657
I'll see myself out.

777
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:24,336
Lord Dillingham.

778
01:30:27,047 --> 01:30:30,642
Would a demonstration
put your mind at ease?

779
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:02,674
Unless you come to confess...

780
01:31:02,832 --> 01:31:05,381
...you have no business here,
McGivens.

781
01:31:05,543 --> 01:31:08,217
Funny you should mention
confession, padre...

782
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:11,554
...seeing that you're obliged to keep
the secrets of your flock.

783
01:31:13,718 --> 01:31:15,686
Joaquincito, go back inside!

784
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:22,564
Who's Zorro?

785
01:31:23,603 --> 01:31:26,402
You know, Zorro could be anyone at all.

786
01:31:27,649 --> 01:31:29,401
Come on, now.

787
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:32,412
We're both men of God.

788
01:31:35,991 --> 01:31:37,709
You can tell me.

789
01:31:38,201 --> 01:31:39,248
Hey, boss.

790
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:52,765
Lord hates a liar.

791
01:31:54,217 --> 01:31:56,595
All right, I'll tell you.

792
01:31:58,763 --> 01:32:00,231
Run!

793
01:32:14,279 --> 01:32:16,953
Felipe! You killed Felipe!

794
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:43,937
Gentlemen...

795
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:45,560
...the future.

796
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:22,476
This facility will provide
a continuous supply of nitro...

797
01:33:22,889 --> 01:33:24,891
...to the Southern battlefront.

798
01:33:25,058 --> 01:33:27,060
I'll be returning to Europe shortly...

799
01:33:27,227 --> 01:33:30,822
...but Ferroq will remain
to oversee the operation.

800
01:33:32,148 --> 01:33:35,118
The nitro has been concealed
in these bottles...

801
01:33:35,276 --> 01:33:38,530
...to circumvent any prying
Northern patrol.

802
01:33:46,746 --> 01:33:50,796
An urgent matter requires
your attention at the hacienda.

803
01:33:56,756 --> 01:33:58,850
He's going back to the hacienda.

804
01:33:59,008 --> 01:34:00,555
I have to get back before he does.

805
01:34:00,718 --> 01:34:02,641
I'll keep the train from leaving. Go.

806
01:34:02,804 --> 01:34:05,478
Elena. Be careful.

807
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:56,417
Armand.

808
01:35:57,335 --> 01:36:02,262
My goodness, I must have dozed off
and your dogs startled me.

809
01:36:03,549 --> 01:36:06,177
Perhaps they thought
you were someone you're not.

810
01:36:08,221 --> 01:36:10,223
I'm told you arrived early.

811
01:36:10,515 --> 01:36:12,142
I could not wait.

812
01:36:12,308 --> 01:36:14,686
I'm having a special meal prepared.

813
01:36:15,228 --> 01:36:16,605
I hope you're hungry.

814
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:19,023
I'm famished.

815
01:36:27,115 --> 01:36:28,788
Thank you, Marie.

816
01:36:32,537 --> 01:36:34,289
You are not hungry?

817
01:36:51,931 --> 01:36:53,604
Tasty, is it'?

818
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:56,231
It's unusual.

819
01:36:57,228 --> 01:36:58,571
Is it quail?

820
01:37:00,398 --> 01:37:01,524
Pigeon.

821
01:37:31,095 --> 01:37:33,268
As you said, Elena...

822
01:37:34,057 --> 01:37:37,231
...we see the people we love
as we wish them to be...

823
01:37:37,393 --> 01:37:39,566
...not as who they really are.

824
01:37:45,902 --> 01:37:47,620
Did you actually think...

825
01:37:47,779 --> 01:37:51,409
...that I would be swept off my feet
by a sadistic coward like you?

826
01:37:52,742 --> 01:37:55,120
I thought you were a woman of vision.

827
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:59,921
"Vision." I could barely stomach
the sight of you, Armand.

828
01:38:00,083 --> 01:38:03,257
The only way I could bear your touch
was to imagine you were Alejandro.

829
01:38:06,214 --> 01:38:08,637
Your stepfather would be ashamed.

830
01:38:09,509 --> 01:38:12,558
You've become nothing more
than a common woman...

831
01:38:12,804 --> 01:38:15,273
...devoted to a common man.

832
01:38:15,932 --> 01:38:18,526
I take that as a compliment.

833
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:20,937
Mama!

834
01:38:21,896 --> 01:38:23,648
Oh, Joaquin!

835
01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:28,654
Padre's dead and the kid's a witness.

836
01:38:58,766 --> 01:39:00,518
No, no, no.

837
01:39:01,978 --> 01:39:04,197
We'll need the next batch now.

838
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:06,737
Put some more here now.

839
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:09,698
We'll rendezvous at Clanton's Pass.

840
01:39:09,861 --> 01:39:12,284
You and your men can
assume control of the train there.

841
01:39:38,514 --> 01:39:41,063
Zorro! Zorro!

842
01:39:44,061 --> 01:39:45,187
No!

843
01:40:06,542 --> 01:40:07,714
If you please.

844
01:40:43,955 --> 01:40:45,081
Remove his mask.

845
01:40:56,551 --> 01:40:57,803
You.

846
01:41:27,290 --> 01:41:29,258
You've lost it all.

847
01:41:30,501 --> 01:41:32,174
Your wife.

848
01:41:33,170 --> 01:41:34,717
Your son.

849
01:41:36,007 --> 01:41:37,725
And for what?

850
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:43,306
For this?

851
01:41:44,932 --> 01:41:47,230
No matter where you go, Armand...

852
01:41:48,185 --> 01:41:49,858
...whatever you do...

853
01:41:50,605 --> 01:41:53,700
...the world isn't big enough
to hide from me.

854
01:42:10,207 --> 01:42:11,675
Goodbye, de la Vega.

855
01:42:13,294 --> 01:42:15,672
No! Armand, no!

856
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:22,644
Please. Not in front of Joaquin.

857
01:42:28,768 --> 01:42:30,065
Please.

858
01:42:43,783 --> 01:42:45,831
As soon as we're gone.

859
01:42:45,993 --> 01:42:47,415
Elena.

860
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:53,634
My family is my life.

861
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:45,144
Shame about your friend the padre.

862
01:43:45,302 --> 01:43:47,600
But he died with God's name on his lips...

863
01:43:47,763 --> 01:43:49,640
...and a bullet in his heart.

864
01:43:49,807 --> 01:43:53,607
And now I send you out,
a sheep amongst wolves.

865
01:45:34,995 --> 01:45:36,417
Thank God...

866
01:45:37,039 --> 01:45:38,416
...you're alive.

867
01:45:38,749 --> 01:45:40,217
I already did.

868
01:45:45,756 --> 01:45:49,010
Listen, go to the marshal's office...

869
01:45:49,176 --> 01:45:51,804
...and tell them what Armand
is doing here.

870
01:45:52,179 --> 01:45:53,271
Where are you going?

871
01:45:54,306 --> 01:45:55,933
To catch a train.

872
01:46:16,537 --> 01:46:18,790
Can I get you something to drink?

873
01:46:19,164 --> 01:46:21,041
Understand something:

874
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:24,049
You can lock me in a tower forever...

875
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:26,639
...and I will never stop hating you.

876
01:46:27,673 --> 01:46:30,301
You may feel differently when you see
how Joaquin enjoys...

877
01:46:30,467 --> 01:46:32,469
...the life of an aristocrat.

878
01:46:32,636 --> 01:46:35,230
- I can't wait till my <i>papi</i> kicks your--
- Joaquin!

879
01:46:45,983 --> 01:46:48,657
Zorro! Zorro, Zorro!

880
01:46:52,698 --> 01:46:53,745
Don't touch him!

881
01:48:13,237 --> 01:48:14,409
Guards!

882
01:48:40,431 --> 01:48:41,933
Come on!

883
01:48:55,279 --> 01:48:56,280
Yes!

884
01:49:34,777 --> 01:49:37,030
Good boy. Well done.

885
01:50:02,471 --> 01:50:05,270
Let's see how much
your father truly loves you.

886
01:50:17,361 --> 01:50:18,658
Get the boy!

887
01:50:34,044 --> 01:50:36,012
Joaquin, quick.

888
01:50:40,759 --> 01:50:42,682
- Keep going.
- What are you doing?

889
01:50:42,845 --> 01:50:45,849
When the car stops, get off
and follow the tracks back to town.

890
01:50:46,056 --> 01:50:48,058
You are the son of Zorro.
You can do it.

891
01:50:48,225 --> 01:50:49,693
Now, go.

892
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:58,322
How did you get in here?

893
01:52:37,292 --> 01:52:39,169
So the devil will know who sent you.

894
01:53:59,082 --> 01:54:00,755
The drinks are on me.

895
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:32,703
My fellow Californians...

896
01:54:33,116 --> 01:54:36,837
...we have gathered here
at historic Bear Point...

897
01:54:36,995 --> 01:54:42,343
...to make official our entrance into
the United States of America!

898
01:54:43,293 --> 01:54:44,920
Bravo!

899
01:59:07,474 --> 01:59:09,602
Welcome to the Union, governor.

900
02:00:01,152 --> 02:00:04,201
Look at you.
A real heartbreaker, huh?

901
02:00:05,990 --> 02:00:07,537
- Dad?
- Yeah?

902
02:00:07,701 --> 02:00:10,420
Why didn't you tell me who you are?

903
02:00:12,455 --> 02:00:13,957
Come here.

904
02:00:17,585 --> 02:00:18,882
Joaquin...

905
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:25,636
...when you were born, I vowed
I would give my life to keep you safe.

906
02:00:27,053 --> 02:00:30,102
I thought I could protect you
by hiding the truth.

907
02:00:33,727 --> 02:00:35,479
But your mother was right.

908
02:00:35,645 --> 02:00:39,900
It wasn't my secret to keep.
It belongs to all of us.

909
02:00:41,568 --> 02:00:45,118
So I promise I will never
lie to you again. Never.

910
02:01:03,006 --> 02:01:08,228
I bless these rings in the name of the
Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

911
02:01:15,226 --> 02:01:16,569
Elena...

912
02:01:17,270 --> 02:01:21,525
...receive this ring as a sign
of my love and fidelity.

913
02:01:25,695 --> 02:01:27,038
Alejandro...

914
02:01:27,947 --> 02:01:33,204
...receive this ring as a sign
of my love and fidelity.

915
02:01:40,627 --> 02:01:45,133
Today you join in the fullness of time
for all eternity.

916
02:01:45,298 --> 02:01:48,973
Yea, seeketh tolerance
when easily provoked.

917
02:01:49,135 --> 02:01:53,231
Love endureth,
for it keeps no score of wrongs.

918
02:01:53,598 --> 02:01:57,569
Love bears all things
and believes all things.

919
02:01:57,894 --> 02:02:00,568
Love endures day by day...

920
02:02:00,939 --> 02:02:02,486
...hour by hour...

921
02:02:02,649 --> 02:02:04,322
- ...minute by minute.
- Padre.

922
02:02:04,776 --> 02:02:06,528
Love is patient--

923
02:02:06,694 --> 02:02:07,991
Padre.

924
02:02:08,488 --> 02:02:11,241
Can you hurry it up a little?
The people are calling.

925
02:02:16,162 --> 02:02:17,914
It's who we are.

926
02:02:19,457 --> 02:02:21,425
- Do you want her back?
- Of course I do.

927
02:02:21,584 --> 02:02:24,303
- And you take him?
- If I must.

928
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:31,724
You may now kiss the bride. Again.

929
02:02:38,351 --> 02:02:39,944
Don't wait up.

930
02:02:40,103 --> 02:02:41,446
Never.
