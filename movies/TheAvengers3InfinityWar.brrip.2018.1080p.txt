<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe they'll make you

I think I have 200.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dollars?</font>

00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:52,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Rupees.
- Which is?</font>

94
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:54,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, buck and a half.</font>

95
00:10:54,322 --> 00:10:55,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want?</font>

96
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:58,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wouldn't say no
to a tuna melt.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who?</font>

100
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:30,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slow down, slow down.
I'll spell it out for you.</font>

101
00:11:30,191 --> 00:11:31,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're totally rambling.</font>

102
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:32,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, I'm not.
- You lost me.</font>

103
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:33,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, you know how
you're having a dream,</font>

104
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:34,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and in the dream
you gotta pee.</font>

105
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:35,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Okay.</font>

106
00:11:36,072 --> 00:11:37,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then you're like,
"Oh, my God.</font>

107
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:38,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"There's no bathrooms.
What am I gonna do?</font>

108
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:39,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- "Oh, someone's watching."
- Right.</font>

109
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:40,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Oh, I'm gonna
go in my pants."</font>

110
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:41,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then you wake up
and in real life</font>

111
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:42,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you actually have to pee.</font>

112
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:43,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes.
- Yeah.</font>

113
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Everybody has that.</font>

114
00:11:45,373 --> 00:11:47,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, that's the point
I'm trying to make.</font>

115
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:51,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Apropos of that, last night
I dreamt we had a kid.</font>

116
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:53,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was so real.</font>

117
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:54,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We named him
after your eccentric uncle.</font>

118
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, what was his name?</font>

119
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:58,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right.
- Morgan! Morgan.</font>

120
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:00,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So you woke up...
- Naturally.</font>

121
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:01,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and thought that we were...</font>

122
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Expecting.
- Yeah.</font>

123
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:04,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes?
- No.</font>

124
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:05,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a dream about it.
It was so real.</font>

125
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you wanted to have a kid...</font>

126
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:09,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you wouldn't have done that.</font>

127
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:12,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm glad you brought this up,
'cause it's nothing.</font>

128
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:13,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just a housing unit
for nanoparticles.</font>

129
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not helping
your case, okay?</font>

130
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:16,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, this is detachable.
It's not a...</font>

131
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:17,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't need that.</font>

132
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, I had the surgery.</font>

133
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:20,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just
trying to protect us...</font>

134
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and future usses
and that's it.</font>

135
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just in case there's a monster
in the closet.</font>

136
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:26,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Instead of, you know...
- Shirts.</font>

137
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know me so well.</font>

138
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- God.
- You finish all my sentences.</font>

139
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:34,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should have shirts
in your closet.</font>

140
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:35,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

141
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:38,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what there should be?
No more surprises.</font>

142
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:39,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna have
a nice dinner tonight.</font>

143
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show off this Harry Winston.</font>

144
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:44,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right? And we should have
no more surprises. Ever.</font>

145
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:45,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should promise you.</font>

146
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes.
- I will.</font>

147
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

148
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:51,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony Stark.</font>

149
00:12:51,981 --> 00:12:54,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Doctor Stephen Strange.
I need you to come with me.</font>

150
00:12:56,986 --> 00:12:59,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, uh, congratulations
on the wedding, by the way.</font>

151
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, you giving out
tickets to something?</font>

152
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:03,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need your help.</font>

153
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not overselling it
to say that</font>

154
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:07,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the fate of the universe
is at stake.</font>

155
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:08,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And who's "we"?</font>

156
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:11,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Tony.</font>

157
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:12,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bruce.</font>

158
00:13:12,877 --> 00:13:14,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Pepper.
- Hi.</font>

159
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:19,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh.
- You okay?</font>

160
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:23,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At the dawn
of the universe,</font>

161
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:25,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there was nothing. Then...</font>

162
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:26,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boom.</font>

163
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:30,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Big Bang sent
six elemental crystals...</font>

164
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:33,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">hurtling across
the virgin universe.</font>

165
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:36,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These Infinity Stones</font>

166
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:39,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">each control an essential
aspect of existence.</font>

167
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:41,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Space.</font>

168
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:43,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reality.</font>

169
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:46,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Power.</font>

170
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:48,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Soul.</font>

171
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mind.</font>

172
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Time.</font>

173
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:05,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me his name again.</font>

174
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:06,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanos.</font>

175
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a plague, Tony.</font>

176
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.</font>

177
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:12,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He wipes out
half the population.</font>

178
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:14,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He sent Loki.</font>

179
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The attack on New York,
that's him.</font>

180
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:19,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is it.</font>

181
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:21,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's our timeline?</font>

182
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No telling. He has
the Power and Space Stones.</font>

183
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:24,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That already makes him</font>

184
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the strongest creature
in the whole universe.</font>

185
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:30,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony...</font>

186
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:31,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He could destroy life</font>

187
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on a scale
hitherto undreamt of.</font>

188
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you seriously just say
"hitherto undreamt of"?</font>

189
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:37,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you seriously leaning
on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?</font>

190
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:39,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that what it is?</font>

191
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to allow that.</font>

192
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If Thanos needs all six,
why don't we just</font>

193
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">stick this one down
a garbage disposal?</font>

194
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:50,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No can do.</font>

195
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:53,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.</font>

196
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:54,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I swore off dairy...</font>

197
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:57,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but then Ben & Jerry's named
a flavor after me.</font>

198
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- Not bad.</font>

199
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A bit chalky.</font>

200
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:01,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A Hunk of Hulk of
Burning Fudge is our favorite.</font>

201
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:03,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's a thing?
- Whatever.</font>

202
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:04,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Point is, things change.</font>

203
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:07,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our oath to protect
the Time Stone cannot change.</font>

204
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:09,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.</font>

205
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:10,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, so conversely,</font>

206
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:12,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it may also be
his best chance against us.</font>

207
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if we don't do our jobs.</font>

208
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is your job exactly?</font>

209
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:17,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Besides making
balloon animals.</font>

210
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:20,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Protecting your reality,
douchebag.</font>

211
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:23,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, guys. Could we table
this discussion right now?</font>

212
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:25,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The fact is
we have this stone.</font>

213
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:26,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We know where it is.</font>

214
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:29,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone...</font>

215
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:31,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we have to find him now.</font>

216
00:15:32,141 --> 00:15:33,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that's the thing.</font>

217
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:34,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?</font>

218
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2 weeks ago, Vision turned
off his transponder.</font>

219
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:38,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's offline.</font>

220
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:39,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Yeah.</font>

221
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony, you lost
another super-bot?</font>

222
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't lose him. He's more
than that. He's evolving.</font>

223
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who could find Vision then?</font>

224
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:49,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

225
00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:51,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably Steve Rogers.</font>

226
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:52,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, great.</font>

227
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe.</font>

228
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:55,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But...</font>

229
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:00,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call him.</font>

230
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:02,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not that easy.</font>

231
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, we haven't caught up
in a spell, have we?</font>

232
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:06,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

233
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:08,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Avengers broke up.
We're toast.</font>

234
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:10,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Broke up?</font>

235
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a band?
Like... Like the Beatles?</font>

236
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:15,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cap and I fell out hard.</font>

237
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not on speaking terms.</font>

238
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:22,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony, listen to me.</font>

239
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:24,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor's gone.</font>

240
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanos is coming.</font>

241
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:29,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.</font>

242
00:16:46,382 --> 00:16:47,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Flip phone.</font>

243
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:09,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say, Doc, you wouldn't
happen to be</font>

244
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">moving your hair, would ya?</font>

245
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:14,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not at the moment, no.</font>

246
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:48,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

247
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:50,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Help him!
- Banner!</font>

248
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:52,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wong! Look alive!
- Go, go! We got it!</font>

249
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:53,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Friday, what am I looking at?</font>

250
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:55,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Not sure.
I'm working on it.</i></font>

251
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:57,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! You might wanna
put that Time Stone</font>

252
00:17:57,453 --> 00:17:58,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in your back pocket, Doc!</font>

253
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:00,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Might wanna use it.</font>

254
00:18:27,483 --> 00:18:29,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ned, hey. I need you
to cause a distraction.</font>

255
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit.</font>

256
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:33,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're all gonna die!</font>

257
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:34,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a spaceship!</font>

258
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:36,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's going on?
- Oh, my God!</font>

259
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:45,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the matter
with you kids?</font>

260
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:47,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You never seen
a spaceship before?</font>

261
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:02,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Friday, evac anyone
south of 43rd Street.</font>

262
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:03,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Notify first responders.</font>

263
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:04,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Will do.</i></font>

264
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:36,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hear me and rejoice.</font>

265
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:38,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are about to die</font>

266
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:41,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at the hands
of the Children of Thanos.</font>

267
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be thankful...</font>

268
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:46,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that your meaningless lives
are now contributing...</font>

269

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry,
Earth is closed today.</font>

270
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:52,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You better pack it up
and get outta here.</font>

271
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:53,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stonekeeper.</font>

272
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:57,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does this chattering animal
speak for you?</font>

273
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:58,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Certainly not.
I speak for myself.</font>

274
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're trespassing in
this city and on this planet.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm, no, not really.</font>

280
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:14,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But when do I ever get
what I want?</font>

been having a thing.</font>

291

Let's go.</font>

293
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.</font>

294
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:47,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony, I'm sorry.
Either I can't or he won't.</font>

295

Keep an eye on him. Thank you.</font>

297
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:52,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I have him.
- Damn it.</font>

A little something I...</i></font>

Do you plan on helping out?</i></font>

309

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, man.
What's up, Mr. Stark?</font>

316
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:34,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Kid, where'd you come from?</i>
- A field trip to MoMA.</font>

317

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, what is this guy's
problem, Mr. Stark?</font>

318
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:39,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, he's from space.</font>

319
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:41,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He came here to steal
a necklace from a wizard.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your powers are quaint.</font>

321
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:12,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must be popular
with children.</font>

322
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.</font>

323

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I'll take it
off your corpse.</font>

324
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:37,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll find removing a
dead man's spell troublesome.</font>

325
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:39,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll only wish
you were dead.</font>

326
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:50,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

329
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:06,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not cool.</font>

330
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:11,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gotcha!</font>

331
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait!</font>

332
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:24,673

I'm gonna catch you.</font>

340
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:23,732

save the wizard!</font>

341

You're running out of air.</font>

343
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. That makes sense.</font>

344
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:50,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Stark, it smells
like a new car in here!</font>

00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:46,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm muscular.</font>

411
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:47,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But who are you
kidding, Quill?</font>

412
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:48,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're one sandwich
away from fat.</font>

413
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:49,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, right.</font>

414
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's true, Quill.
You have put on weight.</font>

415
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:52,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

416
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:56,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gamora, do you think I'm...</font>

417
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:02,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He is anxious, angry.</font>

418
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:05,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He feels
tremendous loss and guilt.</font>

419
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:09,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like a pirate had a baby
with an angel.</font>

420
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:10,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

421
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a real wake-up call
for me. Okay.</font>

422
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:15,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna get a Bowflex.
I'm gonna commit.</font>

423
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:16,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna get some dumbbells.</font>

424
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:17,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know you can't
eat dumbbells, right?</font>

425
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:19,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like his muscles</font>

426
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:21,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are made
of Cotati metal fibers.</font>

427
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:23,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop massaging his muscles.</font>

428
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:25,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wake him up.</font>

429
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:30,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wake.</font>

430
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who the hell are you guys?</font>

431
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:56,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal.</font>

432
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:58,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To bring balance
to the universe</font>

433
00:30:58,316 --> 00:31:00,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by wiping out
half of all life.</font>

434
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:03,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He used to kill people
planet by planet,</font>

435
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">massacre by massacre.</font>

436
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:06,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Including my own.</font>

437
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:08,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he gets
all six Infinity Stones...</font>

438
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he can do it with the snap
of his fingers like this.</font>

439
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:14,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You seem to know
a great deal about Thanos.</font>

440
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:18,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gamora
is the daughter of Thanos.</font>

441
00:31:22,465 --> 00:31:24,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your father killed my brother.</font>

442
00:31:24,884 --> 00:31:26,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, boy.</font>

443
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:27,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stepfather, technically.</font>

444
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:30,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And she hates him
as much as you do.</font>

445
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:35,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Families can be tough.</font>

446
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:36,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before my father died,</font>

447
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:38,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he told me
that I had a half-sister...</font>

448
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:41,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that he imprisoned in Hel.</font>

449
00:31:41,192 --> 00:31:44,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then she returned home
and stabbed me in the eye.</font>

450
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I had to kill her.</font>

451
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's life though,
isn't it, I guess.</font>

452
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goes round and round and...</font>

453
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:50,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel your pain.</font>

454
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel your pain as well,
because...</font>

455
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:54,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean,
it's not a competition,</font>

456
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:55,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I've been through a lot.</font>

457
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:57,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father killed my mother.</font>

458
00:31:58,001 --> 00:31:59,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then I had to kill
my father.</font>

459
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was hard.</font>

460
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:03,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably even harder
than having to kill a sister.</font>

461
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:07,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Plus, I came out with
both my eyes, which was...</font>

462
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:09,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need a hammer, not a spoon.</font>

463
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:13,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of, uh...</font>

464
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:17,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A 4-digit code, maybe?
Maybe a birthdate.</font>

465
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:20,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Uh, what are you doing?
- Taking your pod.</font>

466
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:23,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you're not.</font>

467
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:29,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will not be taking
our pod today, sir.</font>

468
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:32,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh... Quill, are you making
your voice deeper?</font>

469
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:36,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- You are.</font>

470
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:39,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.</font>

471
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm not.</font>

472
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:42,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He just did it again!
- This is my voice.</font>

473
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:50,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you mocking me?</font>

474
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:53,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you mocking me?
- Stop it. You did it again.</font>

475
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:54,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's trying to copy me.</font>

476
00:32:55,016 --> 00:32:56,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you to stop doing that.</font>

477
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:57,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Enough!
- He's doing it first.</font>

478
00:32:57,977 --> 00:32:59,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to stop Thanos.</font>

479
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which means
we need to find out</font>

480
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:02,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where he's going next.</font>

481
00:33:02,315 --> 00:33:03,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Knowhere.</font>

482
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:05,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He must be going somewhere.</font>

483
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:07,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no. Knowhere?</font>

484
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:10,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a place.
We've been there. It sucks.</font>

485
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:12,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Excuse me, that's our food.
- Not anymore.</font>

486
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:16,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor, why would he
go to Knowhere?</font>

487
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:17,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because for years...</font>

488
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:20,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Reality Stone's been
safely stored there</font>

489
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:21,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with a man
called the Collector.</font>

490
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:23,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it's with the
Collector, then it's not safe.</font>

491
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only an idiot
would give that man a stone.</font>

492
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:26,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Or a genius.
- How do you know...</font>

493
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:29,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he's not going
for one of the other stones?</font>

494
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:32,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are six stones
out there.</font>

495
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:34,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanos already has
the Power Stone...</font>

496
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:38,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because he stole it last week
when he decimated Xandar.</font>

497
00:33:38,476 --> 00:33:40,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He stole the Space Stone
from me...</font>

498
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:43,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.</font>

499
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:45,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Time and Mind Stones
are safe on Earth.</font>

500
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:46,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're with the Avengers.</font>

501
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:48,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The Avengers?
- Earth's mightiest heroes.</font>

502
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:50,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like Kevin Bacon?</font>

503
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He may be on the team.
I don't know.</font>

504
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:52,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't been there
in a while.</font>

505
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:55,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As for the Soul Stone, well,
no one's ever seen that.</font>

506
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:56,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one even knows where it is.</font>

507
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:58,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Therefore Thanos can't get it.</font>

508
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Therefore he's going
to Knowhere.</font>

509
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:02,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hence he'll be getting
the Reality Stone.</font>

510
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:04,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're welcome.</font>

511
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:05,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we have to go
to Knowhere now.</font>

512
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:09,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wrong. Where we have to go
is Nidavellir.</font>

513
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:11,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's a made-up word.
- All words are made up.</font>

514
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:14,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nidavellir is real? Seriously?</font>

515
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:16,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That place is a legend.</font>

516
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:18,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They make the most powerful,
horrific weapons</font>

517
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:20,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to ever torment the universe.</font>

518
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:22,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would very much like
to go there, please.</font>

519
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:23,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The rabbit is correct</font>

520
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:24,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and clearly the smartest
among you.</font>

521
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:25,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rabbit?</font>

522
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:28,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only Eitri the Dwarf can
make me the weapon I need.</font>

523
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:29,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I assume
you're the captain, sir.</font>

524
00:34:29,944 --> 00:34:30,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're very perceptive.</font>

525
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:32,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You seem like a noble leader.</font>

526
00:34:32,405 --> 00:34:33,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you join me
on my quest to Nidavellir?</font>

527
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:36,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me just ask the captain.
Oh, wait a second, it's me!</font>

528
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:38,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah. I'll go.
- Wonderful!</font>

529
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, except for that
I'm the captain.</font>

530
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:41,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quiet.</font>

531
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's my backpack.
- Go sit down.</font>

532
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:44,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, this is my ship.</font>

533
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:46,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm not goin' to...</font>

534
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:49,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talkin' about here?</font>

535
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:51,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Thanos-killing kind.</font>

536
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:53,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?</font>

537
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:55,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. You simply lack
the strength to wield them.</font>

538
00:34:55,845 --> 00:34:56,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your bodies would crumble</font>

539
00:34:57,013 --> 00:34:58,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as your minds collapsed
into madness.</font>

540
00:34:58,347 --> 00:35:00,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it weird that I wanna do it
even more now?</font>

541
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:01,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm, a little bit, yeah.</font>

542
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:03,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we don't go to Knowhere</font>

543
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:04,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Thanos retrieves
another stone...</font>

544
00:35:04,854 --> 00:35:06,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he'll be too powerful to stop.</font>

545
00:35:06,564 --> 00:35:08,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He already is.
- I got it figured out.</font>

546
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got two ships</font>

547
00:35:10,693 --> 00:35:12,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a large assortment
of morons.</font>

548
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:15,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So me and Groot will go
with the pirate angel here.</font>

549
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:16,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the morons
will go to Knowhere</font>

550
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:18,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to try to stop Thanos.</font>

551
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:20,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.</font>

552
00:35:20,745 --> 00:35:22,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the record...</font>

553
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:24,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know that
you're going with him</font>

554
00:35:24,207 --> 00:35:25,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because it's where
Thanos isn't.</font>

555
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:26,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, you really shouldn't</font>

556
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:29,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">talk that way
to your captain, Quill.</font>

557
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:31,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Groot.</font>

558
00:35:32,006 --> 00:35:34,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.</font>

559
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:41,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bid you farewell
and good luck, morons.</font>

560
00:35:41,432 --> 00:35:42,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye.</font>

561
00:35:57,323 --> 00:35:58,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vis?</font>

562
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:00,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it the stone again?</font>

563
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:02,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's as if
it's speaking to me.</font>

564
00:36:03,246 --> 00:36:04,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does it say?</font>

565
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:08,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't... I don't know,
but something.</font>

566
00:36:09,794 --> 00:36:11,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

567
00:36:21,514 --> 00:36:24,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me what you feel.</font>

568
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:33,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just feel you.</font>

569
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:43,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So there's a 10:00 a.m.
to Glasgow...</font>

570
00:36:43,995 --> 00:36:45,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which would give us more time
together before you went back.</font>

571
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:47,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if
I miss that train?</font>

572
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's an 11:00.</font>

573
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:51,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if I missed
all the trains?</font>

574
00:36:52,753 --> 00:36:54,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if this time
I didn't go back?</font>

575
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you gave Stark your word.</font>

576
00:36:56,132 --> 00:36:57,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd rather give it to you.</font>

577
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:59,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, there are people who are
expecting me too, you know.</font>

578
00:36:59,594 --> 00:37:00,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We both made promises.</font>

579
00:37:01,095 --> 00:37:02,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not to each other.</font>

580
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:04,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanda.</font>

581
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:07,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For 2 years,
we've stolen these moments...</font>

582
00:37:07,685 --> 00:37:09,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">trying to see
if this could work and...</font>

583
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:11,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

584
00:37:11,647 --> 00:37:13,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what, I'm just
gonna speak for myself.</font>

585
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:15,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think...</font>

586
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:16,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It works.
- It works.</font>

587
00:37:16,903 --> 00:37:18,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It works.</font>

588
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:21,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay.</font>

589
00:37:22,825 --> 00:37:24,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay with me.</font>

590
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:32,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or not. If I'm overstepping...</font>

591
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are they?</font>

592
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:44,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the stone
was warning me about.</font>

593
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:55,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to go.</font>

594
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:56,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Vision.</font>

595
00:37:57,068 --> 00:37:58,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vision, if that's true,</font>

596
00:37:58,402 --> 00:38:01,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then maybe
going isn't the best idea.</font>

597
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:03,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanda, I...</font>

598
00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:05,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vision!</font>

599
00:38:33,688 --> 00:38:36,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The blade,
it stopped me from phasing.</font>

600
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:39,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is that even possible?
- It isn't supposed to be.</font>

601
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:42,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My systems are failing.</font>

602
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:45,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm beginning to think
we should have stayed in bed.</font>

603
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vis!</font>

604
00:38:58,254 --> 00:39:01,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give up the stone,
and she lives.</font>

605
00:39:39,754 --> 00:39:40,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hands off.</font>

606
00:39:56,771 --> 00:39:58,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Come on.</font>

607
00:39:58,189 --> 00:39:59,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, you gotta get up.</font>

608
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:02,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta get up.
Come on. Hey.</font>

609
00:40:03,444 --> 00:40:04,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. We have to go.</font>

610
00:40:06,781 --> 00:40:09,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please. Please leave.</font>

611
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:11,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You asked me to stay.</font>

612
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:13,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm staying.
- Please.</font>

613
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get up.
- I can't.</font>

614
00:41:26,777 --> 00:41:29,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't wanna kill you,
but we will.</font>

615
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:31,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll never get
the chance again.</font>

616
00:41:47,798 --> 00:41:49,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you stand?</font>

617
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:55,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Captain.</font>

618
00:41:58,225 --> 00:41:59,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get you on the jet.</font>

619
00:42:03,814 --> 00:42:07,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I thought we had a deal.</font>

620
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:11,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay close, check in,
don't take any chances.</font>

621
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

622
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:14,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We just wanted time.</font>

623
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:18,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where to, Cap?</font>

624
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:22,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Home.</font>

625
00:42:26,462 --> 00:42:28,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll be safe.
We'll be safe.</font>

626
00:42:53,072 --> 00:42:54,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Zehobereians.</i></font>

627
00:42:54,281 --> 00:42:56,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mother! Where's my mother?</font>

628
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Choose a side or die.</i></font>

629
00:42:57,701 --> 00:42:59,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mother!</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>One side
is a revelation...</i></font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>the other an honor
known only to a few.</i></font>

632
00:43:05,626 --> 00:43:07,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong, little one?</font>

633
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:11,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mother. Where is my mother?</font>

634
00:43:15,928 --> 00:43:17,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's your name?</font>

635
00:43:18,472 --> 00:43:20,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gamora.</font>

636
00:43:20,641 --> 00:43:22,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're quite the fighter,
Gamora.</font>

637
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:25,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come.</font>

638
00:43:25,688 --> 00:43:26,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me help you.</font>

639
00:43:40,202 --> 00:43:41,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look.</font>

640
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:46,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pretty, isn't it?</font>

641
00:43:47,418 --> 00:43:50,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perfectly balanced,
as all things should be.</font>

642
00:43:51,046 --> 00:43:54,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Too much to one side
or the other...</font>

643
00:43:58,804 --> 00:44:01,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here. You try.</font>

644
00:44:05,394 --> 00:44:08,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Now, go in peace
to meet your maker.</i></font>

645
00:44:09,982 --> 00:44:11,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-uh.</font>

646
00:44:13,736 --> 00:44:15,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Concentrate.</font>

647
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There. You've got it.</font>

648
00:44:30,544 --> 00:44:31,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gamora.</font>

649
00:44:32,713 --> 00:44:33,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know if these grenades</font>

650
00:44:33,881 --> 00:44:36,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are the blow-off-your-junk
kind or the gas kind?</font>

651
00:44:36,216 --> 00:44:37,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I was thinking about</font>

652
00:44:37,384 --> 00:44:38,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">hanging a couple
on my belt right here.</font>

653
00:44:39,053 --> 00:44:40,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I don't want to
if they're the...</font>

654
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to ask a favor.</font>

655
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:43,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, sure.</font>

656
00:44:45,267 --> 00:44:46,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One way or another,</font>

657
00:44:46,435 --> 00:44:48,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the path that we're on
leads to Thanos.</font>

658
00:44:50,439 --> 00:44:51,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which is what
the grenades are for.</font>

659
00:44:52,858 --> 00:44:55,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, I'm sorry.
What's the favor?</font>

660
00:44:57,529 --> 00:44:58,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If things go wrong...</font>

661
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:02,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If Thanos gets me...</font>

662
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:08,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to promise me...</font>

663
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:10,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you'll kill me.</font>

664
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:12,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

665
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:18,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know something he doesn't.</font>

666
00:45:20,803 --> 00:45:23,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if he finds it out,</font>

667
00:45:23,097 --> 00:45:24,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the entire universe
could be at risk.</font>

668
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you know?</font>

669
00:45:26,392 --> 00:45:28,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I tell you, you'd know too.</font>

670
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it's so important...</font>

671
00:45:33,482 --> 00:45:34,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">shouldn't I?</font>

672
00:45:34,608 --> 00:45:35,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only if you wanna die.</font>

673
00:45:35,984 --> 00:45:37,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?</font>

674
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:39,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just...</font>

675
00:45:42,408 --> 00:45:45,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust me.
And possibly kill me.</font>

676
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:47,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I'd like to.</font>

677
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really would. But you...</font>

678
00:45:50,082 --> 00:45:51,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Swear to me.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh.
- Dude.</font>

683
00:46:29,663 --> 00:46:31,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long have you been
standing there?</font>

684
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:32,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An hour.</font>

685
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:34,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An hour?</font>

686

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you serious?</font>

687
00:46:36,086 --> 00:46:38,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've mastered the ability</font>

688
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:41,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of standing
so incredibly still...</font>

692

<font face="Comic Sans MS">But my movement...</font>

693
00:46:54,646 --> 00:46:56,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was so slow...</font>

694
00:46:57,107 --> 00:46:58,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that it's imperceptible.</font>

695
00:46:59,109 --> 00:47:00,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm, no.</font>

696
00:47:00,194 --> 00:47:02,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure I'm invisible.</font>

697
00:47:02,696 --> 00:47:03,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, Drax.</font>

698
00:47:06,575 --> 00:47:07,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it.</font>

699
00:47:27,471 --> 00:47:29,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This place looks deserted.</font>

700

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm reading movement
in the third quadrant.</font>

701
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:34,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep,
I'm picking that up too.</font>

702
00:47:35,646 --> 00:47:37,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's put down right here.</font>

703

<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you thought it would add
even the slightest trinket...</font>

707
00:47:57,709 --> 00:47:59,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to your pathetic collection.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you have
the Reality Stone, Tivan.</font>

709
00:48:10,806 --> 00:48:14,268

a great deal of suffering.</font>

710
00:48:17,521 --> 00:48:19,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you.</font>

711
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:20,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I sold it.</font>

712
00:48:23,777 --> 00:48:25,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would I lie?</font>

713
00:48:25,946 --> 00:48:28,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I imagine it's like
breathing for you.</font>

714
00:48:28,991 --> 00:48:30,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like suicide.</font>

715
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:32,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do understand.</font>

716
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:36,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not even you would surrender
something so precious.</font>

717
00:48:36,498 --> 00:48:37,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know what it was.</font>

718
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:40,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then you're more of a fool
than I took you for.</font>

719
00:48:41,211 --> 00:48:42,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's him.</font>

720
00:48:42,379 --> 00:48:43,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Last chance,
charlatan.</font>

721
00:48:45,382 --> 00:48:47,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the stone?</font>

722
00:48:47,509 --> 00:48:48,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today...</font>

of my wife and daughter.</font>

725
00:48:52,139 --> 00:48:53,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drax, wait.</font>

726
00:48:54,683 --> 00:48:56,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not yet, not yet, not yet.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drax, Drax, Drax.
Listen to me.</font>

729
00:49:03,775 --> 00:49:06,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He doesn't have the stone yet.</font>

730
00:49:06,194 --> 00:49:07,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we get it,
then we can stop him.</font>

731
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:11,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to get
the stone first. Yeah.</font>

732
00:49:11,992 --> 00:49:13,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

733
00:49:13,243 --> 00:49:16,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. For Ovette, for Camaria.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">The other right.</font>

738
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:03,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

739
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:17,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why you, daughter?</font>

740
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:37,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was quick.</font>

741
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:48,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Magnificent! Magnificent!
Magnificent!</font>

00:51:40,849 --> 00:51:43,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's something we need
to discuss, little one.</font>

00:56:22,756 --> 00:56:24,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is awkward.</font>

820
00:56:26,801 --> 00:56:28,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we gotta assume
they're coming back, right?</font>

821
00:56:28,511 --> 00:56:29,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they can clearly find us.</font>

822
00:56:29,846 --> 00:56:32,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?</font>

823
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:33,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After the whole
Accords situation,</font>

824
00:56:33,933 --> 00:56:35,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he and Scott took a deal.
It was too tough</font>

825
00:56:35,602 --> 00:56:37,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on their families.
They're on house arrest.</font>

826
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:38,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.</font>

827
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:40,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's an Ant-Man
and a Spider-Man?</font>

828
00:56:41,107 --> 00:56:42,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, look.</font>

829
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:45,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanos has the biggest army
in the universe...</font>

830
00:56:45,236 --> 00:56:48,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he is not gonna stop
until he gets...</font>

831
00:56:50,492 --> 00:56:51,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vision's stone.</font>

832
00:56:51,701 --> 00:56:52,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we have to protect it.</font>

833
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:54,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we have to destroy it.</font>

834
00:56:56,915 --> 00:56:58,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been giving
a good deal of thought</font>

835
00:56:58,291 --> 00:56:59,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to this entity in my head.</font>

836
00:56:59,459 --> 00:57:00,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About its nature.</font>

837
00:57:01,503 --> 00:57:03,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But also its composition.</font>

838
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:05,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think if it were exposed</font>

839
00:57:05,924 --> 00:57:07,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to a sufficiently powerful
energy source...</font>

840
00:57:07,926 --> 00:57:11,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">something very similar to
its own signature, perhaps...</font>

841
00:57:13,348 --> 00:57:15,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">its molecular integrity
could fail.</font>

842
00:57:16,059 --> 00:57:18,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, and you with it.</font>

843
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:20,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not having
this conversation.</font>

844
00:57:20,396 --> 00:57:22,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eliminating the stone
is the only way</font>

845
00:57:22,482 --> 00:57:24,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to be certain that
Thanos can't get it.</font>

846
00:57:25,026 --> 00:57:27,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's too high a price.</font>

847
00:57:31,741 --> 00:57:34,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only you have
the power to pay it.</font>

848
00:57:38,373 --> 00:57:40,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanos threatens
half the universe.</font>

849
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:43,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One life cannot stand
in the way of defeating him.</font>

850
00:57:43,294 --> 00:57:44,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it should.</font>

851
00:57:47,215 --> 00:57:48,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't trade lives, Vision.</font>

852
00:57:48,758 --> 00:57:50,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain, 70 years ago,
you laid down your life...</font>

853
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:52,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to save how many
millions of people?</font>

854
00:57:52,846 --> 00:57:54,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me,
why is this any different?</font>

855
00:57:55,056 --> 00:57:57,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you might
have a choice.</font>

856
00:57:58,643 --> 00:57:59,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your mind is made up</font>

857
00:58:00,061 --> 00:58:02,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of a complex construct
of overlays.</font>

858
00:58:02,605 --> 00:58:06,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis, Ultron,
Tony, me, the stone.</font>

859
00:58:06,359 --> 00:58:08,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All of them mixed together,</font>

860
00:58:08,194 --> 00:58:09,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all of them
learning from one another.</font>

861
00:58:10,071 --> 00:58:11,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're saying Vision isn't
just the stone?</font>

862
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:15,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm saying that
if we take out the stone...</font>

863
00:58:15,243 --> 00:58:16,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there's still a whole lot
of Vision left.</font>

864
00:58:16,744 --> 00:58:18,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps the best parts.</font>

865
00:58:18,538 --> 00:58:19,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we do that?</font>

866
00:58:20,582 --> 00:58:21,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not me, not here.</font>

867
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:24,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well,
you better find someone</font>

868
00:58:24,252 --> 00:58:25,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and somewhere fast.</font>

869
00:58:25,587 --> 00:58:26,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ross isn't just gonna
let you guys</font>

870
00:58:27,046 --> 00:58:28,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have your old rooms back.</font>

871
00:58:31,301 --> 00:58:32,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know somewhere.</font>

872
00:58:47,525 --> 00:58:48,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Kingsguard</font>

873
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:50,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the Dora Milaje
have been alerted.</font>

874
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the Border Tribe?</font>

875
00:58:52,322 --> 00:58:53,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those that are left.</font>

876
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:56,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Send word
to the Jabari as well.</font>

877
00:58:56,492 --> 00:58:58,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">M'Baku likes a good fight.</font>

878
00:59:00,872 --> 00:59:02,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what of this one?</font>

879
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:05,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This one may be tired of war.</font>

880
00:59:05,668 --> 00:59:08,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the White Wolf
has rested long enough.</font>

881
00:59:31,361 --> 00:59:32,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the fight?</font>

882
00:59:33,863 --> 00:59:35,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On its way.</font>

883
00:59:53,675 --> 00:59:56,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In all the time
I've served Thanos...</font>

884
00:59:58,137 --> 01:00:00,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have never failed him.</font>

885
01:00:05,228 --> 01:00:08,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I were to reach
our rendezvous on Titan...</font>

886
01:00:08,481 --> 01:00:10,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the Time Stone
still attached</font>

887
01:00:10,149 --> 01:00:12,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to your vaguely
irritating person...</font>

888
01:00:12,485 --> 01:00:15,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there would be judgment.</font>

889
01:00:23,663 --> 01:00:25,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me...</font>

890
01:00:29,043 --> 01:00:30,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the stone.</font>

891
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, you're a seriously</font>

892
01:00:43,975 --> 01:00:45,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">loyal piece of outerwear,
aren't you?</font>

893
01:00:45,226 --> 01:00:47,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, uh,
speaking of loyalty...</font>

894
01:00:47,812 --> 01:00:48,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the...</font>

895
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I know what you're gonna say.
- You should not be here.</font>

896
01:00:50,898 --> 01:00:51,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it.</font>

897
01:00:52,108 --> 01:00:53,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it was such a long way
down and I just thought</font>

898
01:00:53,192 --> 01:00:54,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- about you on the way...
- And now I gotta hear it.</font>

899
01:00:54,527 --> 01:00:55,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and kinda stuck to the side
of the ship.</font>

900
01:00:55,695 --> 01:00:57,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this suit is ridiculously
intuitive, by the way.</font>

901
01:00:57,905 --> 01:00:58,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God damn it.</font>

902
01:00:59,073 --> 01:01:01,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, if anything, it's kinda
your fault that I'm here.</font>

903
01:01:02,035 --> 01:01:03,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What did you just say?
- I take that back.</font>

904
01:01:03,536 --> 01:01:04,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now, I'm here in space.</font>

905
01:01:04,996 --> 01:01:07,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, right where
I didn't want you to be.</font>

906
01:01:07,582 --> 01:01:09,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't Coney Island.
This isn't a field trip.</font>

907
01:01:09,834 --> 01:01:11,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a one-way ticket.</font>

908
01:01:11,169 --> 01:01:12,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You hear me? Don't pretend
you thought this through.</font>

909
01:01:12,795 --> 01:01:13,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I did think this through.</font>

910
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could not have possibly
thought this through.</font>

911
01:01:15,673 --> 01:01:17,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't be a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man...</font>

912
01:01:17,342 --> 01:01:18,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if there's no neighborhood.</font>

913
01:01:21,095 --> 01:01:22,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, that didn't
really make sense,</font>

914
01:01:22,305 --> 01:01:23,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you know
what I'm trying to say.</font>

915
01:01:25,767 --> 01:01:28,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. We got a situation.</font>

916
01:01:29,645 --> 01:01:30,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See him down there?
He's in trouble.</font>

917
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:31,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's your plan?</font>

918
01:01:31,814 --> 01:01:32,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Go.
- Um...</font>

919
01:01:33,649 --> 01:01:35,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay... Uh...</font>

920
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Did you ever see
this really old movie, Aliens?</font>

921
01:01:42,283 --> 01:01:44,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Painful, aren't they?</font>

922
01:01:45,161 --> 01:01:48,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were originally designed
for microsurgery.</font>

923
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:50,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And any one of them...</font>

924
01:01:55,963 --> 01:01:58,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">could end your friend's life
in an instant.</font>

925
01:01:58,758 --> 01:02:00,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I gotta tell you,
he's not really my friend.</i></font>

926
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:03,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Saving his life is more
of a professional courtesy.</i></font>

927
01:02:05,014 --> 01:02:06,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've saved nothing.</font>

928
01:02:07,642 --> 01:02:09,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your powers
are inconsequential</font>

929
01:02:09,727 --> 01:02:10,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">compared to mine.</font>

930
01:02:11,354 --> 01:02:12,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.</font>

931
01:02:27,161 --> 01:02:29,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes! Wait.
What are those?</font>

932
01:02:44,971 --> 01:02:46,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey,
we haven't officially met.</font>

933
01:02:47,974 --> 01:02:49,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cool.</font>

934
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta turn
this ship around.</font>

935
01:02:52,645 --> 01:02:54,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, now he wants
to run. Great plan.</font>

936
01:02:54,856 --> 01:02:56,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I want to protect
the stone.</font>

937
01:02:56,399 --> 01:02:57,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I want you
to thank me.</font>

938
01:02:57,692 --> 01:02:59,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, go ahead. I'm listening.</font>

939
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:02,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For what?
Nearly blasting me into space?</font>

940
01:03:02,238 --> 01:03:04,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who just saved
your magical ass? Me.</font>

941
01:03:04,657 --> 01:03:05,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I seriously don't know</font>

942
01:03:05,741 --> 01:03:06,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how you fit your head
into that helmet.</font>

943
01:03:07,076 --> 01:03:09,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Admit it, you should've
ducked out when I told you to.</font>

944
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:10,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tried to bench you.
You refused.</font>

945
01:03:11,164 --> 01:03:13,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.</font>

946
01:03:13,249 --> 01:03:14,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And due to that fact,</font>

947
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:16,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we're now
in a flying doughnut...</font>

948
01:03:16,419 --> 01:03:18,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">billions of miles from Earth
with no backup.</font>

949
01:03:18,254 --> 01:03:20,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm backup.
- No, you're a stowaway.</font>

950
01:03:20,339 --> 01:03:21,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The adults are talking.</font>

951
01:03:21,507 --> 01:03:24,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, I'm confused
as to the relationship here.</font>

952
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:25,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is he, your ward?</font>

953
01:03:26,053 --> 01:03:27,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

954
01:03:27,555 --> 01:03:29,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.</font>

955
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:31,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you're using
our made-up names. Um...</font>

956
01:03:32,268 --> 01:03:33,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Spider-Man, then.</font>

957
01:03:34,437 --> 01:03:35,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This ship is
self-correcting its course.</font>

958
01:03:36,022 --> 01:03:37,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thing's on autopilot.</font>

959
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:38,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we control it?</font>

960
01:03:39,066 --> 01:03:40,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fly us home?</font>

961
01:03:43,988 --> 01:03:44,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stark?
- Yeah.</font>

962
01:03:45,156 --> 01:03:46,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you get us home?</font>

963
01:03:46,574 --> 01:03:47,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I heard you.</font>

964
01:03:49,118 --> 01:03:51,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm thinking I'm not
so sure we should.</font>

965
01:03:52,246 --> 01:03:53,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Under no circumstances</font>

966
01:03:53,831 --> 01:03:56,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">can we bring
the Time Stone to Thanos.</font>

967
01:03:56,542 --> 01:03:57,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think
you quite understand</font>

968
01:03:57,793 --> 01:03:58,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what's at stake here.</font>

969
01:03:58,961 --> 01:04:01,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? No. It's you
who doesn't understand...</font>

970
01:04:01,464 --> 01:04:04,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that Thanos has been
inside my head for 6 years.</font>

971
01:04:04,383 --> 01:04:05,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since he sent an army
to New York</font>

972
01:04:06,052 --> 01:04:07,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and now he's back.</font>

973
01:04:07,762 --> 01:04:09,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I don't know what to do.</font>

974
01:04:09,847 --> 01:04:11,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I'm not so sure</font>

975
01:04:11,098 --> 01:04:12,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if it's a better plan to fight
him on our turf or his...</font>

976
01:04:13,059 --> 01:04:16,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you saw what they did,
what they can do.</font>

977
01:04:16,854 --> 01:04:19,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least on his turf,
he's not expecting it.</font>

978
01:04:19,232 --> 01:04:21,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I say we take
the fight to him.</font>

979
01:04:22,151 --> 01:04:23,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doctor.</font>

980
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:26,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you concur?</font>

981
01:04:28,991 --> 01:04:31,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, Stark.
We go to him.</font>

982
01:04:32,662 --> 01:04:34,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you have to understand...</font>

983
01:04:34,872 --> 01:04:36,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if it comes to saving you</font>

984
01:04:36,624 --> 01:04:39,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or the kid
or the Time Stone...</font>

985
01:04:39,252 --> 01:04:42,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will not hesitate
to let either of you die.</font>

986
01:04:42,922 --> 01:04:46,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't, because the universe
depends on it.</font>

987
01:04:47,176 --> 01:04:50,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice. Good, moral compass.</font>

988
01:04:51,347 --> 01:04:52,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're straight.</font>

989
01:04:53,975 --> 01:04:55,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, kid.</font>

990
01:04:56,769 --> 01:04:57,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're an Avenger now.</font>

991
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:36,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought
you might be hungry.</font>

992
01:05:48,821 --> 01:05:50,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I always hated that chair.</font>

993
01:05:50,573 --> 01:05:52,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I've been told.</font>

994
01:05:53,284 --> 01:05:57,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even so, I'd hoped you'd
sit in it one day.</font>

995
01:05:57,955 --> 01:05:59,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hated this room.</font>

996
01:06:00,374 --> 01:06:01,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This ship.</font>

997
01:06:01,834 --> 01:06:03,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hated my life.</font>

998
01:06:08,049 --> 01:06:10,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You told me that too.</font>

999
01:06:13,471 --> 01:06:14,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every day.</font>

1000
01:06:17,642 --> 01:06:19,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For almost 20 years.</font>

1001
01:06:22,146 --> 01:06:24,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was a child
when you took me.</font>

1002
01:06:25,441 --> 01:06:26,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saved you.</font>

1003
01:06:30,279 --> 01:06:31,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1004
01:06:32,782 --> 01:06:36,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. We were happy
on my home planet.</font>

1005
01:06:36,494 --> 01:06:37,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Going to bed hungry...</font>

1006
01:06:38,162 --> 01:06:39,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">scrounging for scraps.</font>

1007
01:06:40,039 --> 01:06:42,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your planet was
on the brink of collapse.</font>

1008
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the one who stopped that.</font>

1009
01:06:45,544 --> 01:06:47,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know
what's happened since then?</font>

1010
01:06:47,546 --> 01:06:49,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The children born...</font>

1011
01:06:49,799 --> 01:06:53,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have known nothing but
full bellies and clear skies.</font>

1012
01:06:53,344 --> 01:06:54,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a paradise.</font>

1013
01:06:57,264 --> 01:06:59,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you murdered
half the planet.</font>

1014
01:06:59,266 --> 01:07:02,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A small price to pay
for salvation.</font>

1015
01:07:02,353 --> 01:07:03,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're insane.</font>

1016
01:07:03,521 --> 01:07:05,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Little one,
it's a simple calculus.</font>

1017
01:07:05,606 --> 01:07:08,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This universe is finite,
its resources finite.</font>

1018
01:07:08,984 --> 01:07:12,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.</font>

1019
01:07:13,406 --> 01:07:14,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It needs correction.</font>

1020
01:07:14,615 --> 01:07:15,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know that!</font>

1021
01:07:17,576 --> 01:07:19,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the only one
who knows that.</font>

1022
01:07:20,413 --> 01:07:24,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.</font>

1023
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:27,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For a time...</font>

1024
01:07:29,797 --> 01:07:34,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you had that same will...</font>

1025
01:07:35,636 --> 01:07:38,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as you fought by my side.</font>

1026
01:07:38,931 --> 01:07:39,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daughter.</font>

1027
01:07:40,766 --> 01:07:42,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not your daughter.</font>

1028
01:07:44,937 --> 01:07:47,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything I hate about myself
you taught me.</font>

1029
01:07:48,524 --> 01:07:49,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, in doing so,</font>

1030
01:07:50,025 --> 01:07:52,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">made you the fiercest woman
in the galaxy.</font>

1031
01:07:55,197 --> 01:07:57,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.</font>

1032
01:08:01,412 --> 01:08:03,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry I disappointed you.</font>

1033
01:08:05,374 --> 01:08:07,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am disappointed.</font>

1034
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But not because
you didn't find it.</font>

1035
01:08:14,133 --> 01:08:15,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But because you did.</font>

1036
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:18,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you lied.</font>

1037
01:08:36,071 --> 01:08:37,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nebula.</font>

1038
01:08:44,455 --> 01:08:45,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't do this.</font>

1039
01:08:45,956 --> 01:08:47,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some time ago,</font>

1040
01:08:47,249 --> 01:08:49,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your sister snuck aboard
this ship to kill me.</font>

1041
01:08:50,127 --> 01:08:51,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please don't do this.</font>

1042
01:08:51,212 --> 01:08:53,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And very nearly succeeded.</font>

1043
01:08:54,173 --> 01:08:55,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I brought her here.</font>

1044
01:08:57,176 --> 01:08:58,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To talk.</font>

1045
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:08,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop. Stop it.</font>

1046
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I swear to you on my life.</font>

1047
01:09:17,196 --> 01:09:19,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never found the Soul Stone.</font>

1048
01:09:23,619 --> 01:09:25,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Accessing memory files.</i></font>

1049
01:09:25,371 --> 01:09:26,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You know
what he's about to do.</i></font>

1050
01:09:26,872 --> 01:09:29,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He's finally ready,
and he's going for the stones.</i></font>

1051
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:30,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- All of them.
- He can never get them all.</i></font>

1052
01:09:30,876 --> 01:09:31,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He will!</i></font>

1053
01:09:31,961 --> 01:09:33,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He can't, Nebula.</i></font>

1054
01:09:34,088 --> 01:09:36,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Because I found the map
to the Soul Stone...</i></font>

1055
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:39,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and I burned it to ash.
I burned it.</i></font>

1056
01:09:44,431 --> 01:09:46,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're strong.</font>

1057
01:09:48,269 --> 01:09:49,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me.</font>

1058
01:09:51,856 --> 01:09:53,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're generous.</font>

1059
01:09:54,775 --> 01:09:55,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me.</font>

1060
01:09:57,778 --> 01:10:00,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I never taught you to lie.</font>

1061
01:10:00,364 --> 01:10:02,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why
you're so bad at it.</font>

1062
01:10:05,202 --> 01:10:09,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is the Soul Stone?</font>

1063
01:10:27,141 --> 01:10:28,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vormir!</font>

1064
01:10:46,285 --> 01:10:47,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The stone is on Vormir.</font>

1065
01:10:51,206 --> 01:10:53,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show me.</font>

1066
01:10:55,461 --> 01:10:56,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Groot.</font>

1067
01:10:56,962 --> 01:10:58,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tinkle in the cup.</font>

1068
01:10:58,172 --> 01:10:59,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not looking.
What's there to see?</font>

1069
01:10:59,673 --> 01:11:01,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's a twig? Everybody's
seen a twig before.</font>

1070
01:11:02,009 --> 01:11:03,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Groot.</font>

1071
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:04,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tree, pour what's in the cup</font>

1072
01:11:04,386 --> 01:11:05,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">out into space
and go in the cup again.</font>

1073
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:07,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You speak Groot?</font>

1074
01:11:07,556 --> 01:11:09,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, they taught it on Asgard.
It was an elective.</font>

1075
01:11:09,516 --> 01:11:10,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Groot.</font>

1076
01:11:10,726 --> 01:11:12,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll know when we're close.</font>

1077
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:14,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nidavellir's forge harnesses</font>

1078
01:11:14,563 --> 01:11:16,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the blazing power
of a neutron star.</font>

1079
01:11:19,610 --> 01:11:21,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the birthplace
of my hammer.</font>

1080
01:11:22,321 --> 01:11:24,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's truly awesome.</font>

1081
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:33,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, time to be the captain.</font>

1082
01:11:38,253 --> 01:11:39,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, dead brother, huh?</font>

1083
01:11:40,464 --> 01:11:42,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that could be annoying.</font>

1084
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, he's been dead before.</font>

1085
01:11:46,136 --> 01:11:48,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, no, this time I think
it really might be true.</font>

1086
01:11:49,139 --> 01:11:51,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you said
your sister and your dad?</font>

1087
01:11:51,642 --> 01:11:52,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Both dead.</font>

1088
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But still got a mom, though?</font>

1089
01:11:55,729 --> 01:11:56,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Killed by a dark elf.</font>

1090
01:11:57,147 --> 01:11:58,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A best friend?</font>

1091
01:11:58,273 --> 01:11:59,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stabbed through the heart.</font>

1092
01:12:02,987 --> 01:12:06,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sure you're up to this
particular murder mission?</font>

1093
01:12:08,409 --> 01:12:09,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Absolutely.</font>

1094
01:12:10,035 --> 01:12:13,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rage and vengeance,
anger, loss, regret...</font>

1095
01:12:13,706 --> 01:12:15,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they're all
tremendous motivators.</font>

1096
01:12:15,374 --> 01:12:16,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They really clear the mind.</font>

1097
01:12:16,542 --> 01:12:18,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I'm good to go.</font>

1098
01:12:18,836 --> 01:12:21,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but this Thanos
we're talkin' about...</font>

1099
01:12:21,463 --> 01:12:23,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he's the toughest there is.</font>

1100
01:12:23,924 --> 01:12:25,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.</font>

1101
01:12:26,135 --> 01:12:27,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's never fought me twice.</font>

1102
01:12:28,303 --> 01:12:30,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm getting a new hammer,
don't forget.</font>

1103
01:12:30,222 --> 01:12:32,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It better be some hammer.</font>

1104
01:12:36,603 --> 01:12:38,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I'm 1,500 years old.</font>

1105
01:12:39,648 --> 01:12:41,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've killed twice
as many enemies as that.</font>

1106
01:12:41,859 --> 01:12:43,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And every one of them
would've rather killed me,</font>

1107
01:12:43,902 --> 01:12:44,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but none succeeded.</font>

1108
01:12:45,571 --> 01:12:48,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm only alive
because fate wants me alive.</font>

1109
01:12:48,657 --> 01:12:51,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards...</font>

1110
01:12:51,618 --> 01:12:53,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he'll be the latest
to feel my vengeance.</font>

1111
01:12:53,662 --> 01:12:55,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fate wills it so.</font>

1112
01:12:55,539 --> 01:12:56,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm-hmm.</font>

1113
01:12:56,957 --> 01:12:58,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what if you're wrong?</font>

1114
01:13:02,087 --> 01:13:03,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I'm wrong, then...</font>

1115
01:13:05,174 --> 01:13:06,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what more could I lose?</font>

1116
01:13:20,522 --> 01:13:21,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could lose a lot.</font>

1117
01:13:21,982 --> 01:13:24,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me, personally,
I could lose a lot.</font>

1118
01:13:27,905 --> 01:13:28,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1119
01:13:31,992 --> 01:13:34,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If fate does want you
to kill that crapsack...</font>

1120
01:13:34,244 --> 01:13:35,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're gonna need more
than one stupid eyeball.</font>

1121
01:13:36,121 --> 01:13:38,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's this?
- What's it look like?</font>

1122
01:13:38,457 --> 01:13:40,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some jerk lost a bet with me
on Contraxia.</font>

1123
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:42,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He gave you his eye?</font>

1124
01:13:42,461 --> 01:13:43,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, he gave me 100 credits.</font>

1125
01:13:43,754 --> 01:13:46,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.</font>

1126
01:13:48,634 --> 01:13:49,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, sweet rabbit.</font>

1127
01:13:49,968 --> 01:13:51,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm..</font>

1128
01:13:53,514 --> 01:13:55,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

1129
01:13:56,809 --> 01:13:57,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

1130
01:13:58,185 --> 01:14:00,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would've washed that.</font>

1131
01:14:00,938 --> 01:14:03,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only way I could sneak it
off Contraxia was up my...</font>

1132
01:14:04,775 --> 01:14:05,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, we're here!</font>

1133
01:14:09,863 --> 01:14:10,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think
this thing works.</font>

1134
01:14:11,156 --> 01:14:12,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything seems dark.</font>

1135
01:14:14,785 --> 01:14:16,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It ain't the eye.</font>

1136
01:14:29,842 --> 01:14:31,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something's wrong.</font>

1137
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:33,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The star's gone out.</font>

1138
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:35,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the rings are frozen.</font>

1139
01:14:57,119 --> 01:14:58,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope
these dwarves are better</font>

1140
01:14:58,662 --> 01:15:00,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at forging
than they are cleaning.</font>

1141
01:15:05,669 --> 01:15:07,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe they realized
that they live</font>

1142
01:15:07,337 --> 01:15:08,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in a junk pile
in the middle of space.</font>

1143
01:15:08,922 --> 01:15:11,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This forge hasn't gone dark
in centuries.</font>

1144
01:15:14,178 --> 01:15:16,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said Thanos
had a gauntlet, right?</font>

1145
01:15:16,972 --> 01:15:18,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, why?</font>

1146
01:15:18,307 --> 01:15:20,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It look
anything like that?</font>

1147
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:25,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Groot.</font>

1148
01:15:25,689 --> 01:15:27,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go back to the pod.</font>

1149
01:15:31,195 --> 01:15:32,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eitri, wait!</font>

1150
01:15:33,238 --> 01:15:34,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop!</font>

1151
01:15:35,157 --> 01:15:36,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop.</font>

1152
01:15:36,867 --> 01:15:37,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor?</font>

1153
01:15:41,205 --> 01:15:42,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened here?</font>

1154
01:15:42,998 --> 01:15:45,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were supposed
to protect us.</font>

1155
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:48,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Asgard was supposed
to protect us.</font>

1156
01:15:49,004 --> 01:15:51,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Asgard is destroyed.</font>

1157
01:15:53,467 --> 01:15:57,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eitri, the glove.
What did you do?</font>

1158
01:16:10,067 --> 01:16:13,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">300 dwarves
lived on this ring.</font>

1159
01:16:14,446 --> 01:16:17,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought if I did what
he asked, they'd be safe.</font>

1160
01:16:19,868 --> 01:16:21,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I made what he wanted.</font>

1161
01:16:23,038 --> 01:16:27,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.</font>

1162
01:16:31,922 --> 01:16:34,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then he killed
everyone anyway.</font>

1163
01:16:36,593 --> 01:16:38,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All except me.</font>

1164
01:16:39,471 --> 01:16:41,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Your life is yours," he said.</font>

1165
01:16:42,641 --> 01:16:46,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"But your hands
are mine alone."</font>

1166
01:16:47,562 --> 01:16:49,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eitri, this isn't about
your hands.</font>

1167
01:16:50,691 --> 01:16:52,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every weapon
you've ever designed,</font>

1168
01:16:52,359 --> 01:16:53,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">every axe, hammer, sword...</font>

1169
01:16:53,944 --> 01:16:56,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's all inside your head.</font>

1170
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:58,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I know it feels
like all hope is lost.</font>

1171
01:16:59,116 --> 01:17:00,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust me, I know.</font>

1172
01:17:01,118 --> 01:17:05,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But together, you and I,
we can kill Thanos.</font>

1173
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:48,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mantis, listen very carefully.</font>

1174
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:51,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you
to meet me on Titan.</font>

1175
01:17:57,549 --> 01:17:58,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, what's going on?</font>

1176
01:17:58,842 --> 01:18:00,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think we're here.</font>

1177
01:18:00,218 --> 01:18:02,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think this rig has
a self-park function.</font>

1178
01:18:04,431 --> 01:18:05,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get your hand
inside the steering gimbal.</font>

1179
01:18:06,058 --> 01:18:07,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Close those around it.</font>

1180
01:18:08,769 --> 01:18:09,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You understand?
- Yep, got it.</font>

1181
01:18:09,978 --> 01:18:11,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This was meant for
one big guy, so we gotta</font>

1182
01:18:11,355 --> 01:18:13,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- move at the same time.
- Okay, okay. Ready.</font>

1183
01:18:17,444 --> 01:18:18,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We might wanna turn.</font>

1184
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:20,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Turn! Turn! Turn!</font>

1185
01:18:50,018 --> 01:18:51,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You all right?</font>

1186
01:18:52,562 --> 01:18:54,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was close.</font>

1187
01:18:55,649 --> 01:18:56,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I owe you one.</font>

1188
01:18:57,401 --> 01:18:59,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me just say, if aliens</font>

1189
01:18:59,569 --> 01:19:01,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">wind up implanting eggs
in my chest or something...</font>

1190
01:19:01,488 --> 01:19:02,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I eat one of you,
I'm sorry.</font>

1191
01:19:02,781 --> 01:19:05,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do not want another
single pop culture reference</font>

1192
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:06,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">out of you for the rest
of the trip. You understand?</font>

1193
01:19:06,868 --> 01:19:08,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm trying to say
that something is coming.</font>

1194
01:19:15,752 --> 01:19:16,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanos!</font>

1195
01:19:37,649 --> 01:19:39,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, whoa, whoa! Please don't
put your eggs in me!</font>

1196
01:19:41,153 --> 01:19:43,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay down, clown.</font>

1197
01:19:48,827 --> 01:19:50,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Die, blanket of death!</font>

1198
01:19:56,835 --> 01:19:59,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody stay where
you are. Chill the eff out.</font>

1199
01:20:00,964 --> 01:20:02,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna ask you
this one time.</font>

1200
01:20:03,717 --> 01:20:04,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is Gamora?</font>

1201
01:20:05,135 --> 01:20:07,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. I'll do you one better.
Who's Gamora?</font>

1202
01:20:07,929 --> 01:20:10,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll do you one better.
Why is Gamora?</font>

1203
01:20:10,891 --> 01:20:12,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me where the girl is
or I swear to you</font>

1204
01:20:12,893 --> 01:20:14,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna French fry
this little freak.</font>

1205
01:20:14,311 --> 01:20:17,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's do it. You shoot my guy
and I'll blast him. Let's go!</font>

1206
01:20:17,731 --> 01:20:20,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do it, Quill! I can take it.</font>

1207
01:20:20,484 --> 01:20:22,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, he can't take it!
- She's right. You can't.</font>

1208
01:20:22,652 --> 01:20:24,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell
me where she is? That's fine.</font>

1209
01:20:24,863 --> 01:20:25,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll kill all three of you</font>

1210
01:20:25,989 --> 01:20:27,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'll beat it
out of Thanos myself.</font>

1211
01:20:27,991 --> 01:20:28,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Starting with you.</font>

1212
01:20:29,075 --> 01:20:30,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, what, Thanos?</font>

1213
01:20:30,243 --> 01:20:32,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, let me ask you
this one time.</font>

1214
01:20:32,829 --> 01:20:34,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What master do you serve?</font>

1215
01:20:34,664 --> 01:20:35,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What master do I serve?</font>

1216
01:20:35,999 --> 01:20:37,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What am I supposed to say,
"Jesus"?</font>

1217
01:20:38,376 --> 01:20:39,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're from Earth.</font>

1218
01:20:39,461 --> 01:20:40,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not from Earth,
I'm from Missouri.</font>

1219
01:20:40,629 --> 01:20:41,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that's on Earth,
dipshit.</font>

1220
01:20:42,130 --> 01:20:43,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you hassling us for?</font>

1221
01:20:43,256 --> 01:20:45,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you're not
with Thanos?</font>

1222
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:47,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With Thanos?</font>

1223
01:20:47,969 --> 01:20:50,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm here to kill Thanos.</font>

1224
01:20:50,722 --> 01:20:52,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He took my girl.
Wait, who are you?</font>

1225
01:20:53,391 --> 01:20:55,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We're the Avengers, man.
- Oh.</font>

1226
01:20:55,185 --> 01:20:57,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the ones
Thor told us about.</font>

1227
01:20:57,646 --> 01:20:58,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know Thor?</font>

1228
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:00,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1229
01:21:00,148 --> 01:21:02,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tall guy, not that
good-looking, needed saving.</font>

1230
01:21:02,776 --> 01:21:04,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is he now?</font>

1231
01:21:19,501 --> 01:21:21,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the plan? We're gonna
hit him with a brick?</font>

1232
01:21:21,545 --> 01:21:22,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a mold.</font>

1233
01:21:23,505 --> 01:21:24,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A king's weapon.</font>

1234
01:21:25,465 --> 01:21:27,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Meant to be
the greatest in Asgard.</font>

1235
01:21:28,426 --> 01:21:31,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In theory, it could even
summon the Bifrost.</font>

1236
01:21:31,471 --> 01:21:32,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did it have a name?</font>

1237
01:21:34,182 --> 01:21:35,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stormbreaker.</font>

1238
01:21:35,809 --> 01:21:36,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a bit much.</font>

1239
01:21:38,979 --> 01:21:40,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So how do we make it?</font>

1240
01:21:41,898 --> 01:21:44,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll have to restart
the forge.</font>

1241
01:21:45,068 --> 01:21:47,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Awaken the heart
of a dying star.</font>

1242
01:21:49,906 --> 01:21:52,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rabbit, fire up the pod.</font>

1243
01:21:56,204 --> 01:21:58,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The hell happened
to this planet?</font>

1244
01:21:58,331 --> 01:22:00,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's eight degrees
off its axis.</font>

1245
01:22:00,208 --> 01:22:02,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gravitational pull
is all over the place.</font>

1246
01:22:03,753 --> 01:22:06,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.</font>

1247
01:22:07,507 --> 01:22:10,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll use it.
All right, I have a plan.</font>

1248
01:22:10,302 --> 01:22:11,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or at least
the beginnings of one.</font>

1249
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:13,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's pretty simple.
We draw him in,</font>

1250
01:22:13,138 --> 01:22:14,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">pin him down,
get what we need.</font>

1251
01:22:14,514 --> 01:22:16,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Definitely don't wanna
dance with this guy.</font>

1252
01:22:16,266 --> 01:22:17,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We just want the gauntlet.</font>

1253
01:22:17,892 --> 01:22:20,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you yawning?</font>

1254
01:22:20,353 --> 01:22:22,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the middle of this, while
I'm breaking it down? Huh?</font>

1255
01:22:22,647 --> 01:22:23,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you hear what I said?</font>

1256
01:22:24,482 --> 01:22:26,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I stopped listening after
you said, "We need a plan."</font>

1257
01:22:26,901 --> 01:22:27,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Mr. Clean
is on his own page.</font>

1258
01:22:28,153 --> 01:22:30,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, "not winging it"
isn't really what they do.</font>

1259
01:22:31,156 --> 01:22:32,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, what exactly
is it that they do?</font>

1260
01:22:32,824 --> 01:22:34,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kick names, take ass.</font>

1261
01:22:34,576 --> 01:22:35,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that's right.</font>

1262
01:22:42,542 --> 01:22:43,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, just get over here,
please.</font>

1263
01:22:44,294 --> 01:22:46,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Lord, can you get
your folks to circle up?</font>

1264
01:22:46,379 --> 01:22:48,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.</font>

1265
01:22:51,259 --> 01:22:52,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta coalesce.</font>

1266
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:54,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...</font>

1267
01:22:54,512 --> 01:22:56,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, don't call us plucky.</font>

1268
01:22:56,973 --> 01:22:58,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't know what it means.</font>

1269
01:22:58,558 --> 01:23:01,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, we're optimistic,
yes. I like your plan.</font>

1270
01:23:01,311 --> 01:23:03,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except it sucks,
so let me do the plan...</font>

1271
01:23:03,938 --> 01:23:05,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that way
it might be really good.</font>

1272
01:23:06,024 --> 01:23:07,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell him about the dance-off
to save the universe.</font>

1273
01:23:08,151 --> 01:23:10,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What dance-off?
- It's nothing.</font>

1274
01:23:10,445 --> 01:23:11,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like in Footloose, the movie?</font>

1275
01:23:11,655 --> 01:23:13,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly like Footloose.</font>

1276
01:23:13,573 --> 01:23:15,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it still the greatest movie
in history?</font>

1277
01:23:15,241 --> 01:23:16,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It never was.</font>

1278
01:23:16,534 --> 01:23:17,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't encourage this,
all right?</font>

1279
01:23:17,661 --> 01:23:18,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- We're getting no help</font>

1280
01:23:19,037 --> 01:23:20,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- from Flash Gordon here.
- Flash Gordon?</font>

1281
01:23:20,705 --> 01:23:21,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By the way,
that's a compliment.</font>

1282
01:23:22,415 --> 01:23:23,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't forget, I'm half human.</font>

1283
01:23:24,084 --> 01:23:25,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So that 50% of me
that's stupid...</font>

1284
01:23:26,836 --> 01:23:27,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's 100% you.</font>

1285
01:23:28,004 --> 01:23:29,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your math
is blowing my mind.</font>

1286
01:23:29,339 --> 01:23:30,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

1287
01:23:31,633 --> 01:23:35,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But does your friend
often do that?</font>

1288
01:23:36,471 --> 01:23:38,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Strange, we all right?</font>

1289
01:23:49,067 --> 01:23:50,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're back. You're all right.</font>

1290
01:23:50,193 --> 01:23:51,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hi.
- Hey, what was that?</font>

1291
01:23:52,487 --> 01:23:56,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I went forward in time
to view alternate futures.</font>

1292
01:23:57,033 --> 01:23:58,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To see all
the possible outcomes</font>

1293
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:00,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of the coming conflict.</font>

1294
01:24:01,246 --> 01:24:02,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many did you see?</font>

1295
01:24:02,747 --> 01:24:04,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">14,000,605.</font>

1296
01:24:06,668 --> 01:24:08,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many did we win?</font>

1297
01:24:12,841 --> 01:24:14,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One.</font>

1298
01:24:35,905 --> 01:24:38,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The stone
had better be up there.</font>

1299
01:24:40,785 --> 01:24:42,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For your sister's sake.</font>

1300
01:25:03,725 --> 01:25:08,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.</font>

1301
01:25:10,565 --> 01:25:13,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gamora, daughter of Thanos.</font>

1302
01:25:13,985 --> 01:25:15,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know us?</font>

1303
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:19,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is my curse to know all
who journey here.</font>

1304
01:25:20,366 --> 01:25:22,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is the Soul Stone?</font>

1305
01:25:22,744 --> 01:25:24,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should know...</font>

1306
01:25:25,079 --> 01:25:28,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it extracts a terrible price.</font>

1307
01:25:29,542 --> 01:25:31,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am prepared.</font>

1308
01:25:33,588 --> 01:25:36,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We all think that at first.</font>

1309
01:25:40,553 --> 01:25:42,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are all wrong.</font>

1310
01:25:54,442 --> 01:25:56,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How is it you know
this place so well?</font>

1311
01:25:56,945 --> 01:26:01,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A lifetime ago,
I, too, sought the stones.</font>

1312
01:26:01,741 --> 01:26:04,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I even held one in my hand.</font>

1313
01:26:04,619 --> 01:26:08,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it cast me out,
banished me here.</font>

1314
01:26:08,832 --> 01:26:12,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guiding others to a treasure
I cannot possess.</font>

1315
01:26:21,594 --> 01:26:24,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you seek
lies in front of you.</font>

1316
01:26:25,473 --> 01:26:27,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As does what you fear.</font>

1317
01:26:28,351 --> 01:26:29,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's this?</font>

1318
01:26:30,311 --> 01:26:31,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The price.</font>

1319
01:26:32,021 --> 01:26:36,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.</font>

1320
01:26:37,652 --> 01:26:41,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You might say it has
a certain wisdom.</font>

1321
01:26:43,116 --> 01:26:44,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me what it needs.</font>

1322
01:26:45,118 --> 01:26:48,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To ensure that
whoever possesses it...</font>

1323
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:51,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">understands its power...</font>

1324
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:56,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the stone demands a sacrifice.</font>

1325
01:26:56,254 --> 01:26:57,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of what?</font>

1326
01:26:58,214 --> 01:27:00,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In order to take the stone,</font>

1327
01:27:00,258 --> 01:27:02,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you must lose
that which you love.</font>

1328
01:27:05,597 --> 01:27:06,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A soul...</font>

1329
01:27:07,557 --> 01:27:08,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for a soul.</font>

1330
01:27:24,532 --> 01:27:26,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All my life,
I dreamed of a day...</font>

1331
01:27:27,827 --> 01:27:29,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a moment...</font>

1332
01:27:30,538 --> 01:27:32,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you got
what you deserved.</font>

1333
01:27:34,834 --> 01:27:37,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I was always
so disappointed.</font>

1334
01:27:40,715 --> 01:27:42,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But now...</font>

1335
01:27:46,137 --> 01:27:49,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You kill and torture...</font>

1336
01:27:51,184 --> 01:27:53,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you call it mercy.</font>

1337
01:27:57,273 --> 01:27:59,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The universe has judged you.</font>

1338
01:28:00,944 --> 01:28:05,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You asked it for a prize,
and it told you no.</font>

1339
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:08,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You failed.</font>

1340
01:28:09,827 --> 01:28:11,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And do you wanna know why?</font>

1341
01:28:12,664 --> 01:28:14,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you love nothing.</font>

1342
01:28:15,208 --> 01:28:16,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one.</font>

1343
01:28:22,465 --> 01:28:23,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1344
01:28:28,262 --> 01:28:29,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

1345
01:28:30,306 --> 01:28:31,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tears?</font>

1346
01:28:32,183 --> 01:28:34,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not for him.</font>

1347
01:28:48,408 --> 01:28:49,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1348
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:52,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't love.</font>

1349
01:28:53,413 --> 01:28:56,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ignored my destiny once.</font>

1350
01:28:58,543 --> 01:29:00,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cannot do that again.</font>

1351
01:29:01,212 --> 01:29:04,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even for you.</font>

1352
01:29:28,781 --> 01:29:31,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, little one.</font>

1353

<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1355
01:31:16,848 --> 01:31:18,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope you're right
about this.</font>

1356
01:31:18,266 --> 01:31:21,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or we're gonna land
a lot faster than you want to.</font>

1357
01:31:36,868 --> 01:31:38,244

1360
01:31:41,956 --> 01:31:43,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what did you imagine?</font>

1361
01:31:44,083 --> 01:31:45,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Olympics.</font>

1362
01:31:45,376 --> 01:31:47,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe even a Starbucks.</font>

1363
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:02,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Should we bow?</font>

1364
01:32:02,894 --> 01:32:04,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, he's a king.</font>

1365
01:32:04,478 --> 01:32:06,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.</font>

1366

<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

1367
01:32:09,859 --> 01:32:11,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, we don't do that here.</font>

1368
01:32:12,028 --> 01:32:14,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So how big of an assault
should we expect?</font>

1369
01:32:14,447 --> 01:32:17,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, sir, I think you should
expect quite a big assault.</font>

1370
01:32:17,617 --> 01:32:18,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How we looking?</font>

1371
01:32:18,701 --> 01:32:20,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will have my Kingsguard,</font>

1372

<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Border Tribe,
the Dora Milaje, and...</font>

01:32:30,463 --> 01:32:31,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How you been, Buck?</font>

1375
01:32:31,797 --> 01:32:34,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, not bad,
for the end of the world.</font>

1376
01:32:46,979 --> 01:32:48,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>

1377
01:32:48,105 --> 01:32:50,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The structure is polymorphic.</font>

1378
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:53,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, we had to attach
each neuron non-sequentially.</font>

1379
01:32:53,945 --> 01:32:55,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't you just reprogram</font>

1380
01:32:55,863 --> 01:32:57,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the synapses
to work collectively?</font>

1381
01:32:59,075 --> 01:33:02,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because we didn't think of it.</font>

1382
01:33:02,745 --> 01:33:04,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure you did your best.</font>

1383
01:33:04,205 --> 01:33:05,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you do it?</font>

1384
01:33:06,332 --> 01:33:09,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, but there are more than
2 trillion neurons here.</font>

1385
01:33:09,794 --> 01:33:12,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One misalignment could cause
a cascade of circuit failures.</font>

1386
01:33:13,339 --> 01:33:14,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It will take time, brother.</font>

1387
01:33:16,133 --> 01:33:17,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long?</font>

1388
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:18,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As long as you can give me.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something's entered
the atmosphere.</font>

1390
01:33:42,201 --> 01:33:44,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Cap, we got
a situation here.</font>

1391
01:33:54,005 --> 01:33:55,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, I love this place.</font>

1395
01:34:20,990 --> 01:34:22,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to destroy
the stone now.</font>

back on the table.</font>

1397

<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will hold them off.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanda, as soon as that stone's
out of his head...</font>

1399
01:34:29,707 --> 01:34:30,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you blow it to hell.</font>

1400
01:34:31,125 --> 01:34:32,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will.</font>

1401

Engage all defenses.</font>

- With the iris closed,</font>

1418
01:36:33,706 --> 01:36:34,748

1419
01:36:34,915 --> 01:36:36,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long will it take
to heat it?</font>

1420

<font face="Comic Sans MS">A few minutes,
maybe more. Why?</font>

without that axe.</font>

1424
01:36:55,769 --> 01:36:56,812

the tree line.</font>

1431
01:37:44,109 --> 01:37:46,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you
for standing with us.</font>

1432
01:37:46,779 --> 01:37:47,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, brother.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's your other friend?</font>

1434
01:38:10,678 --> 01:38:13,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will pay for his life
with yours.</font>

1435
01:38:14,056 --> 01:38:16,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanos will have that stone.</font>

1436
01:38:17,017 --> 01:38:18,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not gonna happen.</font>

1437
01:38:18,644 --> 01:38:20,938

01:38:21,105 --> 01:38:24,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanos will have nothing
but dust and blood.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have blood to spare.</font>

1440
01:38:41,125 --> 01:38:42,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They surrender?</font>

1441
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:44,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not exactly.</font>

1442

<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell?</font>

1443
01:39:15,868 --> 01:39:17,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like we pissed her off.</font>

1444
01:39:28,255 --> 01:39:29,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're killing themselves.</font>

1445
01:40:06,043 --> 01:40:07,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see the teeth
on those things?</font>

1451
01:40:27,189 --> 01:40:28,941

in front of us.</font>

1452
01:40:29,149 --> 01:40:30,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do we do that?</font>

1453
01:40:32,861 --> 01:40:34,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We open the barrier.</font>

1454
01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:40,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On my signal, open North-West
Section Seventeen.</font>

1458
01:40:46,458 --> 01:40:48,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This will be
the end of Wakanda.</font>

1459
01:40:49,670 --> 01:40:53,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then it will be
the noblest ending in history.</font>

1460
01:41:05,936 --> 01:41:07,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wakanda forever!</font>

1461
01:41:19,950 --> 01:41:20,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now!</font>

1462
01:41:51,273 --> 01:41:52,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How much longer, Shuri?</font>

1463
01:41:52,858 --> 01:41:54,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've barely begun, brother.</font>

1464
01:41:54,568 --> 01:41:56,403

the full force of a star.</font>

1468
01:42:11,418 --> 01:42:12,836

his mission.</font>

1487
01:46:41,021 --> 01:46:42,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You may regret that.</font>

1488
01:46:43,356 --> 01:46:44,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He brought you face-to-face</font>

1489
01:46:44,816 --> 01:46:46,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the Master
of the Mystic Arts.</font>

1490
01:46:49,404 --> 01:46:51,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And where do you think
he brought you?</font>

1491
01:46:52,949 --> 01:46:55,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me guess. Your home?</font>

1492
01:47:00,040 --> 01:47:01,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was.</font>

1493
01:47:04,086 --> 01:47:05,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it was beautiful.</font>

1494
01:47:08,131 --> 01:47:10,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Titan was like most planets.</font>

1495
01:47:10,759 --> 01:47:13,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Too many mouths,
not enough to go around.</font>

1496
01:47:13,804 --> 01:47:17,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.</font>

1497
01:47:18,058 --> 01:47:19,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Genocide.</font>

1498
01:47:19,976 --> 01:47:24,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But random, dispassionate,
fair to rich and poor alike.</font>

1499
01:47:25,398 --> 01:47:27,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They called me a madman.</font>

1500
01:47:28,276 --> 01:47:30,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what I predicted
came to pass.</font>

1501
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:35,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Congratulations,
you're a prophet.</font>

1502
01:47:35,826 --> 01:47:37,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a survivor.</font>

1503
01:47:37,202 --> 01:47:39,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who wants to murder trillions.</font>

1504
01:47:39,579 --> 01:47:43,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With all six stones, I could
simply snap my fingers.</font>

1505
01:47:43,834 --> 01:47:48,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.</font>

1506
01:47:50,632 --> 01:47:52,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then what?</font>

1507
01:47:53,468 --> 01:47:54,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd finally rest...</font>

1508
01:47:55,762 --> 01:47:58,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.</font>

1509
01:48:00,058 --> 01:48:03,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The hardest choices require
the strongest wills.</font>

1510
01:48:04,437 --> 01:48:09,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you'll find our will
equal to yours.</font>

1511
01:48:10,569 --> 01:48:11,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our?</font>

1512
01:48:17,659 --> 01:48:19,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Piece of cake, Quill.</font>

1513
01:48:19,244 --> 01:48:21,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, if your goal
was to piss him off.</font>

1514
01:48:59,659 --> 01:49:00,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boom!</font>

1515
01:49:01,119 --> 01:49:03,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't let him close his fist.</font>

1516
01:49:08,043 --> 01:49:09,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Magic.</font>

1517
01:49:09,669 --> 01:49:10,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More magic.</font>

1518
01:49:11,504 --> 01:49:12,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Magic with a kick.</font>

1519
01:49:13,131 --> 01:49:14,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Magic with a...</font>

1520
01:49:15,467 --> 01:49:16,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Insect!</font>

1521
01:49:54,172 --> 01:49:55,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, well.</font>

1522
01:49:55,465 --> 01:49:56,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should've killed me.</font>

1523
01:49:56,675 --> 01:49:58,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It would've been
a waste of parts!</font>

1524
01:50:04,015 --> 01:50:05,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Gamora?</font>

1525
01:50:46,474 --> 01:50:47,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Is he under?
Don't let up.</i></font>

1526
01:50:47,684 --> 01:50:50,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be quick. He is very strong.</font>

1527
01:50:50,478 --> 01:50:52,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Parker, help! Get over here.</font>

1528
01:50:52,689 --> 01:50:55,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>She can't hold him
much longer. Let's go.</i></font>

1529
01:51:00,488 --> 01:51:01,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta open
his fingers to get it off.</font>

1530
01:51:01,656 --> 01:51:02,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you'd be
hard to catch.</font>

1531
01:51:02,866 --> 01:51:04,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the record,
this was my plan.</font>

1532
01:51:05,410 --> 01:51:07,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not so strong now, huh?</font>

1533
01:51:07,620 --> 01:51:09,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is Gamora?</font>

1534
01:51:09,456 --> 01:51:11,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My Gamora.</font>

1535
01:51:11,583 --> 01:51:13,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, bullshit!</font>

1536
01:51:13,918 --> 01:51:15,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is she?</font>

1537
01:51:16,296 --> 01:51:17,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He is in anguish.</font>

1538
01:51:18,298 --> 01:51:20,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>

1539
01:51:20,383 --> 01:51:22,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He... He mourns.</font>

1540
01:51:23,261 --> 01:51:26,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does
this monster have to mourn?</font>

1541
01:51:27,599 --> 01:51:28,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gamora.</font>

1542
01:51:32,562 --> 01:51:33,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1543
01:51:33,980 --> 01:51:35,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He took her to Vormir.</font>

1544
01:51:36,107 --> 01:51:38,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He came back
with the Soul Stone.</font>

1545
01:51:38,860 --> 01:51:40,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But she didn't.</font>

1546
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:45,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it
right now. You understand?</font>

1547
01:51:46,326 --> 01:51:49,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't, don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!</font>

1548
01:51:51,039 --> 01:51:52,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me she's lying.</font>

1549
01:51:54,501 --> 01:51:57,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Asshole,
tell me you didn't do it!</font>

1550
01:51:58,755 --> 01:52:02,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had to.</font>

1551
01:52:02,926 --> 01:52:04,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you didn't.</font>

1552
01:52:04,427 --> 01:52:06,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you didn't.</font>

1553
01:52:10,058 --> 01:52:11,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, you didn't!
- Quill!</font>

1554
01:52:11,559 --> 01:52:13,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, stop!
Hey, stop! Stop!</font>

1555
01:52:14,062 --> 01:52:15,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Hey, stop! Stop!</i></font>

1556
01:52:15,188 --> 01:52:17,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's coming, it's
coming. I got it, I got it!</font>

1557
01:52:20,652 --> 01:52:21,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God.</font>

1558
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:23,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come and get some,
space dogs!</font>

1559
01:53:26,551 --> 01:53:29,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! Get some! Get some!</font>

1560
01:53:29,304 --> 01:53:31,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! Get some!</font>

1561
01:53:31,473 --> 01:53:33,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How much for the gun?
- Not for sale.</font>

1562
01:53:34,142 --> 01:53:36,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. How much for the arm?</font>

1563
01:53:37,896 --> 01:53:39,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'll get that arm.</font>

1564
01:53:48,781 --> 01:53:49,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">New haircut?</font>

1565
01:53:50,158 --> 01:53:51,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Noticed you've copied
my beard.</font>

1566
01:53:54,078 --> 01:53:55,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By the way, this is
a friend of mine, Tree.</font>

1567
01:53:56,748 --> 01:53:58,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Groot.</font>

1568
01:53:59,667 --> 01:54:01,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Steve Rogers.</font>

1569
01:54:21,189 --> 01:54:23,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fall back! Fall back, now!</font>

1570
01:54:32,784 --> 01:54:34,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Focus that fire
on the left flank, Sam.</font>

1571
01:54:35,078 --> 01:54:36,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm doing it.</font>

1572
01:55:00,103 --> 01:55:01,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why was she up there
all this time?</font>

1573
01:55:02,689 --> 01:55:05,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's on the field. Take it.</font>

1574
01:55:37,181 --> 01:55:39,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, we got
a Vision situation here.</font>

1575
01:55:42,061 --> 01:55:43,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somebody get to Vision!</font>

1576
01:55:44,188 --> 01:55:45,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- I got him!</i>
- On my way.</font>

1577
01:55:51,362 --> 01:55:54,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'll die alone. As will you.</font>

1578
01:55:54,365 --> 01:55:55,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's not alone.</font>

1579
01:56:21,893 --> 01:56:23,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh, no, you don't.</i></font>

1580
01:56:23,770 --> 01:56:25,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't gonna be
like New York, pal.</font>

1581
01:56:25,396 --> 01:56:27,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This suit's already kicked
the crap outta the Hulk.</font>

1582
01:56:27,857 --> 01:56:28,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What? No! No!</i></font>

1583
01:56:32,612 --> 01:56:35,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Guys!
Vision needs backup, now!</i></font>

1584
01:56:37,325 --> 01:56:38,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hulk? Hulk,</font>

1585
01:56:38,993 --> 01:56:40,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you like making your
entrance at the last second.</font>

1586
01:56:41,079 --> 01:56:43,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, this is it, man.
This is the last, last second.</font>

1587
01:56:48,169 --> 01:56:49,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hulk! Hulk!</font>

1588
01:56:50,588 --> 01:56:51,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hulk!</font>

1589
01:56:52,757 --> 01:56:54,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1590
01:56:55,093 --> 01:56:57,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, screw
you, you big, green asshole!</font>

1591
01:56:58,012 --> 01:56:59,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll do it myself!</font>

1592
01:57:00,139 --> 01:57:01,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Come on! Yeah!</i></font>

1593
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:15,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>See ya!</i></font>

1594
01:57:27,458 --> 01:57:29,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hulk, we got a lot
to figure out, pal.</font>

1595
01:57:41,013 --> 01:57:42,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you were formidable,
machine.</font>

1596
01:57:43,850 --> 01:57:46,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you're dying,
like any man.</font>

1597
01:57:54,986 --> 01:57:56,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get outta here!</font>

1598
01:57:59,657 --> 01:58:00,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>

1599
01:58:19,427 --> 01:58:21,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was really gross.</font>

1600
01:58:48,247 --> 01:58:49,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought I told you to go.</font>

1601
01:58:50,875 --> 01:58:52,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't trade lives, Captain.</font>

1602
01:59:04,138 --> 01:59:06,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you. I got you.</font>

1603
01:59:06,432 --> 01:59:08,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry I can't remember
anybody's names.</font>

1604
01:59:53,688 --> 01:59:55,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're full of tricks, wizard.</font>

1605
01:59:57,275 --> 02:00:00,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yet you never once used
your greatest weapon.</font>

1606
02:00:03,614 --> 02:00:04,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A fake.</font>

1607
02:00:12,582 --> 02:00:16,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You throw another moon at me,
and I'm gonna lose it.</font>

1608
02:00:16,210 --> 02:00:17,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stark.</font>

1609
02:00:17,545 --> 02:00:18,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know me?</font>

1610
02:00:19,255 --> 02:00:20,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do.</font>

1611
02:00:20,923 --> 02:00:24,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not the only one
cursed with knowledge.</font>

1612
02:00:24,969 --> 02:00:26,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My only curse is you.</font>

1613
02:00:28,890 --> 02:00:29,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

1614
02:00:57,835 --> 02:00:59,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All that for a drop of blood.</font>

1615
02:01:43,839 --> 02:01:45,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have my respect, Stark.</font>

1616
02:01:47,301 --> 02:01:50,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I'm done, half of
humanity will still be alive.</font>

1617
02:01:56,018 --> 02:01:58,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope they remember you.</font>

1618
02:02:07,905 --> 02:02:09,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop.</font>

1619
02:02:15,329 --> 02:02:16,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spare his life...</font>

1620
02:02:18,124 --> 02:02:19,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I will give you the stone.</font>

1621
02:02:23,421 --> 02:02:24,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No tricks.</font>

1622
02:02:29,510 --> 02:02:30,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't.</font>

1623
02:03:21,937 --> 02:03:23,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One to go.</font>

1624
02:03:33,532 --> 02:03:34,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is he?</font>

1625
02:03:43,918 --> 02:03:45,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did we just lose?</font>

1626
02:03:49,215 --> 02:03:51,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would you do that?</font>

1627
02:03:54,470 --> 02:03:56,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're in the endgame now.</font>

1628
02:04:21,539 --> 02:04:24,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay?</font>

1629
02:04:26,085 --> 02:04:27,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? What is it?</font>

1630
02:04:29,964 --> 02:04:31,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's here.</font>

1631
02:04:42,101 --> 02:04:45,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone, on my position.
We have incoming.</font>

1632
02:04:47,898 --> 02:04:49,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell?</font>

1633
02:05:15,384 --> 02:05:16,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cap.</font>

1634
02:05:17,136 --> 02:05:18,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's him.</font>

1635
02:05:20,639 --> 02:05:23,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eyes up. Stay sharp.</font>

1636
02:05:47,708 --> 02:05:48,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanda.</font>

1637
02:05:49,835 --> 02:05:51,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's time.</font>

1638
02:05:51,295 --> 02:05:52,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1639
02:05:52,463 --> 02:05:54,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They can't stop him, Wanda,
but we can.</font>

1640
02:05:54,840 --> 02:05:56,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at me.</font>

1641
02:05:56,425 --> 02:05:57,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have the power
to destroy the stone.</font>

1642
02:05:57,676 --> 02:05:58,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't.</font>

1643
02:05:58,761 --> 02:05:59,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must do it. Wanda, please.</font>

1644
02:06:01,889 --> 02:06:04,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are out of time.</font>

1645
02:06:05,267 --> 02:06:06,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't.</font>

1646
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:07,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, you can.</font>

1647
02:06:08,646 --> 02:06:09,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can.</font>

1648
02:06:11,398 --> 02:06:13,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he gets the stone,
half the universe dies.</font>

1649
02:06:16,070 --> 02:06:17,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not fair.</font>

1650
02:06:18,781 --> 02:06:20,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It shouldn't be you,
but it is.</font>

1651
02:06:22,326 --> 02:06:23,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right.</font>

1652
02:06:25,204 --> 02:06:26,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could never hurt me.</font>

1653
02:06:35,965 --> 02:06:37,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just feel you.</font>

1654
02:08:00,883 --> 02:08:02,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right.</font>

1655
02:08:11,935 --> 02:08:13,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right.</font>

1656
02:08:17,608 --> 02:08:18,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you.</font>

1657
02:08:48,013 --> 02:08:50,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand, my child.</font>

1658
02:08:51,683 --> 02:08:53,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Better than anyone.</font>

1659
02:08:54,978 --> 02:08:56,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could never.</font>

1660
02:09:01,735 --> 02:09:04,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today, I lost more
than you can know.</font>

1661
02:09:06,532 --> 02:09:09,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But now is no time to mourn.</font>

1662
02:09:11,412 --> 02:09:15,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now is no time at all.</font>

1663
02:09:38,730 --> 02:09:39,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1664
02:10:37,706 --> 02:10:39,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you...</font>

1665
02:10:40,542 --> 02:10:42,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you'd die for that.</font>

1666
02:10:56,725 --> 02:10:58,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should have...</font>

1667
02:11:01,104 --> 02:11:02,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should...</font>

1668
02:11:05,067 --> 02:11:08,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should have
gone for the head.</font>

1669
02:11:10,239 --> 02:11:11,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1670
02:11:44,648 --> 02:11:45,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daughter?</font>

1671
02:11:53,490 --> 02:11:54,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you do it?</font>

1672
02:11:56,785 --> 02:11:57,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1673
02:12:06,211 --> 02:12:07,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did it cost?</font>

1674
02:12:11,508 --> 02:12:13,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything.</font>

1675
02:12:23,270 --> 02:12:24,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you do?</font>

1676
02:12:26,064 --> 02:12:27,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What'd you do?</font>

1677
02:12:41,204 --> 02:12:42,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where'd he go?</font>

1678
02:12:45,500 --> 02:12:46,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thor.</font>

1679
02:12:49,880 --> 02:12:51,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where'd he go?</font>

1680
02:12:51,673 --> 02:12:52,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Steve?</font>

1681
02:13:27,751 --> 02:13:30,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Up, General. Up!</font>

1682
02:13:30,629 --> 02:13:32,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is no place to die.</font>

1683
02:13:47,104 --> 02:13:48,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Groot.</font>

1684
02:13:48,772 --> 02:13:50,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh...</font>

1685
02:13:51,191 --> 02:13:53,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no!</font>

1686
02:13:54,111 --> 02:13:56,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Groot! No.</font>

1687
02:14:10,377 --> 02:14:11,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sam!</font>

1688
02:14:15,590 --> 02:14:17,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sam, where you at?</font>

1689
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:28,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something's happening.</font>

1690
02:14:40,907 --> 02:14:42,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quill?</font>

1691
02:14:49,458 --> 02:14:50,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Steady, Quill.</font>

1692
02:14:50,751 --> 02:14:51,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, man.</font>

1693
02:14:56,089 --> 02:14:57,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony.</font>

1694
02:15:00,635 --> 02:15:03,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was no other way.</font>

1695
02:15:08,769 --> 02:15:09,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Stark?</font>

1696
02:15:14,232 --> 02:15:15,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't feel so good.</font>

1697
02:15:17,652 --> 02:15:18,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're all right.</font>

1698
02:15:18,737 --> 02:15:19,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't... I don't know
what's happening.</font>

1699
02:15:19,905 --> 02:15:21,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know...</font>

1700
02:15:23,200 --> 02:15:24,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to go.</font>

1701
02:15:24,367 --> 02:15:26,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to go, sir.
Please.</font>

1702
02:15:26,244 --> 02:15:28,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.</font>

1703
02:15:33,502 --> 02:15:35,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

1704
02:15:49,851 --> 02:15:51,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He did it.</font>

1705
02:16:16,086 --> 02:16:19,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is this?
What the hell is happening?</font>

1706
02:16:36,189 --> 02:16:37,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God.</font>

1707
02:27:34,222 --> 02:27:35,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Still no word
from Stark?</i></font>

1708
02:27:35,723 --> 02:27:36,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No, not yet.</i></font>

1709
02:27:37,141 --> 02:27:38,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We're watching every satellite</i></font>

1710

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>on both hemispheres,
but still nothing.</i></font>

1711
02:27:40,478 --> 02:27:42,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

1712
02:27:42,605 --> 02:27:44,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Multiple bogeys
over Wakanda.</font>

1713
02:27:45,107 --> 02:27:47,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Same energy signature
as New York?</font>

1714
02:27:47,193 --> 02:27:48,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ten times bigger.</font>

1715

we'll meet him at...</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">They okay?</font>

1718
02:28:08,214 --> 02:28:09,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no one here.</font>
