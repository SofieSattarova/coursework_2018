1
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,845
First time giving blood?

2
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,183
Yes.

3
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,936
They pay cash here.

4
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,730
And there's no limit to how
many times you give.

5
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,857
They even buy it in the jar.

6
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,736
Jared Nomak, we're ready for you.

7
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,460
In the past 12 months,
have you gotten a tattoo...

8
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,921
...or undergone any ear,
skin, or body piercings?

9
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,423
No.

10
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,051
Where did you get that scar on your chin?

11
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:34,970
Childhood accident.

12
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,766
You say you don't have any immediate
next of kin, is that right?

13
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,310
Not that I'm in contact with.

14
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:45,314
- Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
- No one.

15
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,733
- No family?
- I told you, no.

16
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:52,029
Are you telling me I can't be a donor?

17
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:56,408
It depends. We came up with some
unusual results on your blood test.

18
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:59,995
What? How? How unusual?

19
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,915
Let me explain.

20
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:08,837
Your blood has a very rare phenotype,
one we haven't encountered before.

21
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,925
What? What are you talking about?

22
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:19,264
- Who are you? No. No.
- Sit down, please.

23
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,060
What is this?

24
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:27,314
This is a good news-bad
news scenario, Jared.

25
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,274
Good news for us.

26
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,612
Bad news...

27
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,740
...for you.

28
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,682
<i>Forget what you think you know.</i>

29
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:47,060
<i>Vampires exist.</i>

30
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:52,524
<i>My name is Blade.</i>

31
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,736
<i>I was born half human, half vampire.</i>

32
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:01,658
<i>They call me The Daywalker.</i>

33
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:08,498
<i>I have all their strengths,
none of their weaknesses...</i>

34
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,042
<i>...except for the thirst.</i>

35
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,797
<i>Twenty years ago, I met
a man that changed that.</i>

36
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,049
<i>Whistler.</i>

37
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,261
<i>He taught me how to hold
the thirst at bay.</i>

38
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,347
<i>Taught me the rules.</i>

39
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,642
<i>Gave me the weapons to hunt with:</i>

40
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:32,522
<i>Silver, garlic, sunlight.</i>

41
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,859
<i>Two years ago, he was attacked.</i>

42
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:40,614
<i>They took him, and turned him
into the thing I hate most.</i>

43
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,243
<i>I should have finished him off.</i>

44
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,579
<i>Now I'm hunting him.</i>

45
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,626
<i>I will find him.</i>

46
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:56,379
<i>And nothing will stand in my way.</i>

47
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,446
Daywalker's here! Stop him!

48
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,711
Where is he?

49
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,133
Hey!

50
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:16,579
No, no.

51
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:27,382
Take me to him, and I'll
consider you a loose end.

52
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,525
Catch you later.

53
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,481
Old man.

54
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,817
Look at what they've done to you.

55
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,748
Let's go home.

56
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:20,425
Lock up your daughters, boys and girls,
the dark knight returns.

57
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,141
- Need a toke of the smokage there, B?
- Later.

58
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,476
Cut the lights.

59
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:38,067
You found him.

60
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,782
You didn't kill him.

61
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:47,952
Give me a hand.

62
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,750
I got a bad feeling about this, B.

63
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:57,503
Unh! Listen to his breathing.
He's already dying.

64
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,381
He's in pain. Why don't you
just put him out of his misery?

65
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,550
They had him on stasis
in a halfway house.

66
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:06,471
I'm giving him an accelerated
retro-viral detox.

67
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,056
Like a heroin addict.

68
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,559
- Agh!
- Make him go cold turkey in one night.

69
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,144
Shit ain't gonna work, man.

70
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,313
I say you kill the motherfucker right now.

71
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,815
Get out.

72
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:32,497
If there's anything left of you
in there, Whistler, listen up.

73
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:36,626
In the morning, those blinds
are going to open...

74
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:41,130
...whether you're cured or not.

75
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,019
Hey, man, I didn't mean to call him...

76
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,310
<i>Listen to me, Blade.</i>

77
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:41,441
- You're gonna have to finish me off.
- No.

78
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,902
Give me that damn gun.

79
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,244
Now walk away.

80
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:56,247
Stubborn son of a bitch.

81
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,634
How do you feel?

82
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,807
Like hammered shit.

83
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,313
How'd you find me?

84
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:07,360
Started out in Moscow, then Romania.

85
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:11,322
- They kept moving you around.
- How long was I gone?

86
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:18,037
- Months?
- Too long.

87
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,212
Years.

88
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,008
They'd torture me almost to death...

89
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,719
...and then let me heal in a vat of blood...

90
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:37,098
...so they could go at it again.

91
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:44,522
Sorry sons of bitches could have at least
fixed my goddamn leg while they were at it.

92
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,318
Where's my arc welder?

93
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,712
Whistler, nice to meet you, man.
I heard a lot about you.

94
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,548
I'm Josh. You can call me Scud, though.
Everybody does.

95
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,728
Tell me something, Skid.

96
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,231
No, man, it's Scud. Scud, like "stud."

97
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:30,276
- Scud.
- Whatever. What did you do in here?

98
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,738
The pimpmobile? Just a little
after-market modification.

99
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,115
- Nitrous oxide and shit like that.
- Oh, yeah.

100
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:39,201
You gave it a more aggressive
exhaust profile ramping.

101
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,121
Whole package will crank that
Betty up maybe 300 horsepower.

102
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:45,291
You'll burn the damned thing out
before your next oil change.

103
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,252
Where did you dig up
this shitbird, anyway?

104
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,171
What the fuck is your problem, Poppy?

105
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:53,424
My problem is I've been sucking
blood clots for two years.

106
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:56,927
I get out to find some jerkoff
fucking with my life's work.

107
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,263
We jeopardized our operation
to save your ass.

108
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,890
- "Our operation"?
- Yeah.

109
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:04,393
"Our operation"?
I built this operation, you ass-wipe.

110
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,441
Motion sensors. It's on three, gentlemen.

111
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,485
Human?

112
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:17,073
Uh, body temperature, 50.
I'd guess suckhead.

113
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,123
Fried. They're using magnesium flares.

114
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,251
They've got your security
system scoped out.

115
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,589
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I don't trust you...

116
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,802
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

117
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,262
Cool outfit.

118
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,855
Guard lights.

119
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,809
We represent the ruling body
of the Vampire Nation.

120
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,353
They're offering you a truce.

121
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,189
They want to meet with you.

122
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,528
Scud.

123
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,283
Take off your mask.

124
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:56,542
My name is Asad. This is Nyssa.

125
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:03,090
You have been our most feared enemy.

126
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:06,385
But now there's something
else loose on the streets.

127
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,637
Something worse than you.

128
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,946
What's so funny?

129
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:29,241
They tell stories about Blade
as the bogeyman.

130
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,201
Frankly, I'm disappointed.

131
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:35,539
You hear that, B? She's disappointed.

132
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:39,043
He agreed to come along so easily.

133
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:43,339
Come on, B, show her. Pretty please?

134
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,302
Semtex.

135
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:52,097
Enough explosives to level a city block.

136
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:55,935
You still disappointed?

137
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:21,543
The guards look human, B.
They're probably familiars.

138
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:42,272
You sure about this?

139
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,566
What if I'm not?

140
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,664
The true power of the Vampire
Nation lies here.

141
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:12,886
Father?

142
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:24,606
Blade, this is Overlord Eli Damaskinos.

143
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:34,199
It has been said, "Be proud of your
enemy and enjoy his success."

144
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,785
In that regard, I should thank you.

145
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:40,080
- For what?
- Eliminating Deacon Frost.

146
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:43,459
You did us a favor. Karel Kounen.

147
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:48,797
- You're human.
- Barely. I'm a lawyer.

148
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,340
European Health Consortium.

149
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:56,180
As you may know,
vampirism is a horrible virus...

150
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:59,349
...carried in the saliva of predators.

151
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:03,896
In 72 hours, it spreads through
the human bloodstream...

152
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,899
...creating new parasitic organs.

153
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,358
Like cancer.

154
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,489
Cancer with a purpose.

155
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:20,329
Unfortunately, viruses evolve too.
We've encountered a new one.

156
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:21,955
We dubbed it the Reaper strain.

157
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:26,502
And like any good pathogen,
it appears to have found a carrier.

158
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,220
There, Jared Nomak.

159
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:40,766
Born a vampire, but an anomaly like you.

160
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,978
Unlike the rest of us, however...

161
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:50,400
...he feeds on not just humans,
but vampires as well.

162
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,987
- Looks like he was doing me a favor.
- You're missing the point.

163
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:58,033
Their vampire victims don't die.

164
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,244
They turn. They become carriers.

165
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,870
You've got to understand.

166
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:06,166
These things are like crack addicts.
They need to feed daily.

167
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,836
Nomak's been up for 72 hours.

168
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:12,297
By our estimates, there are
already a dozen Reapers.

169
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,716
There'll be hundreds
before the week is out.

170
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:18,095
Thousands within a matter of months.
Do the math.

171
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,265
Wait, let me get this right.

172
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:25,102
You want me to hunt them for you?

173
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:29,898
When they are finished with us,
who do you think they'll turn on next?

174
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,609
Your precious humans.

175
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,612
Not one of them will be left.

176
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,826
We spent two years training a small
tactical unit, the Bloodpack.

177
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:42,703
We want you to lead them.

178
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,454
Two years?

179
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,749
We've been training to hunt you.

180
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:55,674
- So, B-man, what do you think?
- Sounds like a plan.

181
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,051
What do you really think?

182
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:01,054
They're gonna fuck us
the first chance they get.

183
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,808
We ain't gonna do this, though, right?

184
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,561
We'll play along for now.

185
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:10,480
They'll take us in deeper
than we've ever been.

186
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,650
Get a chance to see
how their world really ticks.

187
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,652
I had enough of their world.

188
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:21,366
They're just shitting bricks because
they're no longer top of the food chain.

189
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,661
Damn, man, I'm really worried about him.

190
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:29,208
Look, I know he's your friend and all,
but I think you should watch him.

191
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:33,503
Nobody goes cold turkey
from the thirst in just one night.

192
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,381
Looking to get hooked up?

193
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,967
Maybe. What do you have?

194
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:23,845
No problem. Horse, Hawaiian ice.

195
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,056
Whatever you need.

196
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:27,724
Whatever I need.

197
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:32,187
I like that. What if I need you?

198
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:49,413
So, so sweet.

199
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:29,119
They are ready whenever
you are, Daywalker.

200
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:46,303
Blade, meet the Bloodpack.

201
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,099
Lighthammer, Verlaine...

202
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,643
...Priest, Snowman...

203
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:58,273
...Chupa and Reinhardt.

204
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,121
Hey, uh.

205
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:17,459
Me and the gang were wondering...

206
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:20,295
What was that?

207
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,715
Can you blush?

208
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,635
Here we go, Poppy.

209
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,014
Oh, I get it.

210
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,059
I see now.

211
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,062
You've been training
for two years to take me out.

212
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:39,523
And now here I am.

213
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,358
Ooh.

214
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:44,653
Ooh, so exciting, isn't it?

215
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,363
Okay, here's your chance.

216
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,201
Come on. Come on,
what are you waiting for?

217
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,704
Here I am, right here in front of you.

218
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,790
Adolf here gets the first shot.

219
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,544
Come on. What are you looking at her for?
You need permission?

220
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:04,923
Maybe you need a little bit of incentive.
Okay, I can help with that.

221
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:09,219
What's the matter? Missed that?

222
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:10,762
It's okay, I can do it again.

223
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,643
Come on. What, you need a manual?

224
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,395
- Kill the bastard!
- Do it! Come on!

225
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:30,740
Now you've got an explosive device
stuck to the back of your head.

226
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:34,744
Silver nitrate, rigged to go off
if anybody tampers with it.

227
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,414
I'll have the detonator with me.

228
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:40,375
And you, if you so much
as look at me wrong...

229
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,212
Whoo.

230
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,424
From now on, we work as a unit.

231
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,760
You'll be taking orders from me.

232
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,222
Any questions?

233
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,438
Good.

234
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:07,444
You want to catch the hunter,
you start with the prey.

235
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:12,616
We'll target all the night places
where vampires congregate.

236
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:18,205
Blood banks, safe houses,
the bigger, the better.

237
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:21,917
So, what's first?

238
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,464
The House of Pain.

239
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,812
Where's the entrance?

240
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:47,776
I don't see any signs, no vampire glyphs.

241
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:51,488
No, because of you,
we've had to rethink our habits...

242
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,074
...tighten our security.

243
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,994
Have a closer look.

244
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:06,878
Nice.

245
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,005
Thirty-eight, .45 and 9mm caliber.

246
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:13,552
All with foil capsules at the tip filled
with silver nitrate and garlic extract.

247
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:19,015
This hyper-velocity stake gun spits out
a silver stake at 6000 feet per second.

248
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,643
Since you suckers don't like sunlight...

249
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:25,480
...we've modified the gun's
entry light with a UV filter.

250
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:28,650
Pop it open, instant UV light.

251
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:33,530
- Filter's on, no problem.
- Yo, B, check this out.

252
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,907
It's got a pneumatic
syringe delivery system.

253
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,369
The vials are filled with
an anticoagulant called EDTA.

254
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:42,080
One punch with this blows
your target up like a balloon.

255
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:45,000
The cartridge ejects. Automatic reload.

256
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,127
Nice.

257
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:49,713
Let's go.

258
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:52,382
You won't pass for one of us. No way.

259
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:54,718
- Like I give a shit.
- No, he's right.

260
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,763
Why don't you post up
on the roof over there?

261
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,224
Cover our backs.

262
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:04,894
So the Bloodpack's calling
the shots now, huh?

263
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,230
Great.

264
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:12,360
Better curb that dog of yours
or we'll do it for you.

265
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,408
Keep pushing, asshole.

266
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,287
We're in.

267
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,798
You're about to enter our world.

268
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:18,051
You will see things, feeding.

269
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:20,804
Just remember why you're here.

270
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,723
I haven't forgotten.

271
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,571
What exactly are we looking for in here?

272
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,574
Anything that looks suspicious.

273
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,959
You gotta be kidding me.

274
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,756
<i>What y'all get it ain't haunted, call it
I see some of y'all thirsty for it</i>

275
00:36:56,923 --> 00:37:00,385
<i>Straight frontin' y'all winnin' come down
To the combat, dog, I'm a workaholic</i>

276
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:03,930
<i>My swag touches every enemy
Within my clutches</i>

277
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:07,225
<i>Black makin' that ruckus
And I'm puttin' that lean on all you suckas</i>

278
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:11,187
<i>Black! Your bone crushes
Every opponent suffers</i>

279
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,649
<i>Your tone hushes from punches
Don't you like percussion?</i>

280
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:16,484
<i>Don't lose yo life for nothin'</i>

281
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,194
<i>You don't wanna try to touch 'em</i>

282
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:21,531
<i>No competition, listen
This ain't open for discussion</i>

283
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:24,617
<i>Ha, you want it, want it
Come on, you want it</i>

284
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:29,122
<i>Ha, come on, you want it, want it
Ha, you want it, come on</i>

285
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,390
Scud, do you read me?

286
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:53,855
- <i>You reading me?</i>
- Reading you loud and clear, B.

287
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:55,857
<i>The whole place is a safe house.</i>

288
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,401
<i>Windows are painted black,
one access door.</i>

289
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:01,070
- <i>Two, or 300 suckheads in here.</i>
- That sounds cool.

290
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,949
Hey, W, you got me?

291
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,995
W?

292
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,752
<i>Tell me something, how's the weather
up there, sweetheart?</i>

293
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:18,922
Walking on sunshine, toad boy.

294
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:25,929
Look at them.

295
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,515
Half of these bastards,
they're not even purebloods.

296
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,892
I tell you what.

297
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:33,061
Why don't we just fucking kill everyone?

298
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,940
Just to make sure.

299
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,321
God, it would be so easy.

300
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,589
He's got you.

301
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:10,306
<i>Fuck you.</i>

302
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:34,163
Daywalker.

303
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,740
Mother's milk.

304
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,620
I say we got about half an hour
till sunrise, Cinderella. Hurry up.

305
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,598
<i>I spotted one, but lost him.</i>

306
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:17,475
<i>Be on the lookout.</i>

307
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,736
Fuck.

308
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:01,037
Whistler, man, they're on the roof.
On the roof of my bus.

309
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,105
Shh.

310
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:29,917
Nomak.

311
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,587
Daywalker.

312
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:35,548
What am I to you?

313
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:40,803
Is the enemy of my enemy
my friend or my enemy?

314
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:58,196
Aah!

315
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:03,117
<i>We're under attack!
There's three of them. Probably more.</i>

316
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:14,837
Daylight.

317
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,276
<i>Silver don't do shit.</i>

318
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:01,444
<i>Don't waste the bullets.</i>

319
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,488
- Motherfucker.
- <i>You hear me, Chupa?</i>

320
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:06,198
Say "cheese."

321
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:25,134
Come on.

322
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,717
How about some daylight, motherfucker?

323
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:04,877
Fuck!

324
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:07,815
Listen to me. If you're under attack, use
your UV lights. They can't take the light.

325
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,490
Priest?

326
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:02,119
We're not dying here, man. Come on.

327
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:03,370
Priest is down.

328
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:12,004
<i>Daylight's coming.
You're on your own, Blade.</i>

329
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:38,447
You want me so bad, Blade?

330
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:41,367
Here I am.

331
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:45,412
Why kill me?

332
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:51,210
You and I, we have the same enemy.

333
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:52,795
We want the same thing.

334
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:33,687
We need the same thing, Blade.

335
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,617
What happened?

336
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:31,036
Why didn't you tell me these
things were immune...

337
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:33,539
- ...to silver and garlic?
- I didn't know.

338
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:36,250
If you did, would you have told me?

339
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:40,170
I think you know the truth
when you hear it.

340
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,382
Then why didn't he kill you?

341
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:52,224
- How long since he's been bitten?
- About 20 minutes.

342
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:56,103
- His skin is fucking burning.
- He's already starting to change.

343
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:02,234
Will someone just shut him the fuck up?

344
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:22,796
Hold on!

345
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:25,424
- Hold him, Chupa!
- Come on, man.

346
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:27,718
Just put him out of his fucking misery.

347
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:31,430
Don't you get it?
You can't finish him that way.

348
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:35,267
Hold him down. Hold him down, Chupa.

349
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,479
Move.

350
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:44,401
Back off!

351
00:56:58,582 --> 00:57:01,710
If that was your Bloodpack
Sunday punch, we're in trouble.

352
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:03,754
This motherfucker left his post.

353
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:06,590
- He just disappeared.
- Where were you?

354
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:08,592
Ran into a little Reaper action myself.

355
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:12,888
Oh, yeah? How little?
We lost a man, Priest.

356
00:57:13,472 --> 00:57:17,309
You want me to carve his
fucking name on your chest?

357
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:19,937
Let me show you.

358
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:30,280
Saw it moving in the alley
and followed it down.

359
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:34,826
Found it just like this.
I think they came through here.

360
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:39,039
It was trying to crawl back
in the culvert and caught his arm.

361
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:42,584
Been gnawing at it like a coyote.

362
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,421
Little boy blue.

363
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:49,841
It's already dying.

364
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:53,053
I need to examine it
as quickly as possible.

365
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:56,431
Okay, look for a lever. Let's open it.

366
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,080
They've made contact with the Reapers.

367
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:23,583
- Any casualties?
- One so far.

368
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:28,213
It was not Nyssa, I trust?

369
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:31,091
No.

370
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:35,012
This a dangerous game
you're playing, Damaskinos.

371
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,556
Blade is too volatile.

372
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:40,017
You won't be able to keep
manipulating him.

373
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,518
You worry too much.

374
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:46,314
I've been informed by our friend inside
that events are unfolding as scripted.

375
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,483
You've already lost one of your own.

376
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:51,028
How many more are you
willing to sacrifice?

377
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:55,991
- Every one.
- Even your own daughter?

378
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:03,373
Yes, even her.

379
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,717
<i>Recognize this?</i>

380
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:17,179
The blood bank. He's one of the guards.

381
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:20,891
So why is he dying? What's killing him?

382
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:22,768
Time.

383
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:25,062
His metabolism is burning too fast.

384
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:31,526
They need fresh blood every couple of hours
or they'll start feeding on themselves.

385
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:34,863
Nomak's different. He's the carrier.

386
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:39,367
It all started with him, it'll end with him.

387
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:06,019
- Open the mouth, Scud.
- Heh.

388
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:09,773
Open the mouth.

389
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,316
B, man, come on.

390
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,401
Sissy.

391
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:27,999
Ugh. Gah.

392
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:32,963
Only the tongue carries the virus.

393
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:36,299
It is injected through these barbs.

394
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:40,137
It has bifurcated masseter muscles.

395
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:43,598
Overdeveloped, allowing
for a much stronger bite.

396
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:48,019
Jaw structure remains the same.

397
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:51,189
But there's no mandible bone.

398
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:52,941
Squeeze that tooth, Scud.

399
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:06,538
Neurotoxin.

400
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:09,332
Probably paralyzes their
victim while they feed.

401
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:16,798
Garlic don't work.
Silver, that don't work.

402
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:21,011
- We gotta go with the sunlight, right?
- That's deadly to us too.

403
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:23,138
So let's see what else we can find.

404
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:54,211
These things are as different
from us as we are from you.

405
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:01,426
Look at that.

406
01:02:01,593 --> 01:02:04,137
The heart is encased in bone.

407
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:07,766
- Only the side is vulnerable.
- Good luck getting a stake through that.

408
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:11,394
Pull a leg off a spider,
it keeps moving on its own...

409
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,981
...essentially trying to walk
without a body attached to it.

410
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:17,567
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Hardwired, right?

411
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:26,660
What the fuck is that?

412
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:30,455
Brain's dead. Body's still trying to feed.

413
01:02:31,957 --> 01:02:36,044
We got six hours before sunrise.
Be ready by then.

414
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:41,132
Hey, what happens at sunrise?

415
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:46,221
Blade, I'm talking to you.
What happens at sunrise?

416
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:49,266
We hunt.

417
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:52,394
- In broad daylight?
- You gotta be fucking joking.

418
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,021
You better get you
some sunscreen, buttercup.

419
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,648
Listen, shitkicker.

420
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:59,985
You're about one cunt hair
away from hillbilly heaven.

421
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:02,862
I love it when you talk dirty.

422
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:07,284
Sunlight's the only edge we've got.

423
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:10,453
- They'll be more vulnerable then.
- And so will we.

424
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:15,500
Let's be real about one thing.

425
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:18,420
I don't expect everybody
to make it back tomorrow.

426
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:24,676
Remember to protect
yourselves at all times.

427
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:34,311
What are you looking for?

428
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:37,314
Phosphor rods. If I can
suss out the light source...

429
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:41,651
...maybe I can make some sort of UV
flash-bang grenade or something.

430
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:42,986
It's been tried already.

431
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:46,656
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster
working on it then, did you?

432
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:00,253
- Blade.
- Mm.

433
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:04,215
- The way you talk to them, us.
- What is it?

434
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:06,843
We are together in this, remember?

435
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:09,721
Why do you hate us so much?

436
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:11,639
It's fate.

437
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:15,226
- It's in my blood.
- Well, it's in mine too.

438
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:18,646
I'm a pureblood. I was born a vampire.

439
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:28,490
You know the thirst better than any of us,
shooting that serum of yours.

440
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:33,453
The only difference between us is that I made
peace with what I am a long time ago.

441
01:04:40,752 --> 01:04:44,506
<i>- How long have you known Blade?
- Going on 20 years.</i>

442
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:47,425
He doesn't talk about
the old days that much.

443
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:50,053
Blade doesn't talk about anything much.

444
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:53,181
You want to hear something funny?

445
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:57,644
Blade kind of looks at you
like a father figure.

446
01:04:57,811 --> 01:04:59,270
Tell me something.

447
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:01,398
How'd you two hook up?

448
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:04,109
I was backpacking.

449
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:07,487
I met these two chicks, decided
to take them back to my, uh, tent...

450
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:10,698
- ...for a little <i>Three's Company</i> action.
- Pretty.

451
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:14,369
Next thing I know, Janet and Chrissy
start tearing chunks out of my stomach.

452
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:17,705
Blade shows up, saves my ass.

453
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:19,958
Everything else just
sort of fell into place.

454
01:05:23,503 --> 01:05:26,172
- Let's try it.
- All right.

455
01:05:38,435 --> 01:05:40,311
Maybe I fucked up.
Maybe you were right.

456
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:49,779
All right. Papa's got a brand new bag.

457
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:31,696
Let me ask one question.

458
01:06:31,863 --> 01:06:34,073
How the hell are we gonna
find these Reapers?

459
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,118
We won't have to. They'll come to us.

460
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,542
- What is this shit?
- Pheromones.

461
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:47,212
Harvested from the Reapers'
adrenal glands.

462
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:49,714
They're gonna key to it.

463
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:55,303
They want us to spray on
some suckpuppy's nut juice?

464
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:59,182
First use your firearms
to drive them back.

465
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:00,892
Then toss your UV grenades.

466
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:03,269
Right. This is what we got
for the grand finale.

467
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:07,857
I hot-wired a couple of these
babies to a nitro-vacuum.

468
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:11,194
Just be real careful where you
pop your load, all right?

469
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:13,029
And you, you're not coming?

470
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:15,573
No. I'm a lover, not a fighter.

471
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:18,701
UVs have a 10-second delay.

472
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:24,874
Nyssa, just remember to take cover.

473
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:30,797
Hey, Blade, give me a hand.

474
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:37,720
You and Miss Muffet getting
a little cozy there?

475
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:40,932
I wouldn't worry about that if I was you.

476
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:43,059
Looks to me like you're
getting confused...

477
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:46,312
...as to which side of the line
you're standing on.

478
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:49,107
Those are real hollow words
coming from a man...

479
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:52,652
...who just spent two years
running with the enemy.

480
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:56,072
And what the hell is that
supposed to mean?

481
01:07:57,282 --> 01:08:00,493
You know, Whistler,
there's an old saying:

482
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:05,665
"Keep your friends close,
but keep your enemies closer."

483
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:07,417
You might want to remember that.

484
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:34,569
<i>Blade, we should split into three units.</i>

485
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:50,687
We're trying to attract them,
not scare them off.

486
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:54,065
Yeah, well, some of us can't see
in the dark, you fucking nipplehead.

487
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:56,484
What am I supposed to do?

488
01:09:57,110 --> 01:10:00,446
Bifocals, Grandpa, and try to keep up.

489
01:10:56,711 --> 01:10:58,629
Let's do this.

490
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:06,137
Hey, hillbilly.

491
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:08,931
What the fuck you doing?

492
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:13,895
Ain't nobody here but you
and us, buttercup.

493
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:19,108
We lose a partner, and Blade loses one!

494
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:29,744
I'll leave you two lovebirds
some time to yourselves.

495
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:08,533
Verlaine?

496
01:13:04,547 --> 01:13:07,258
<i>I spotted a group in the east tunnel.</i>

497
01:13:07,425 --> 01:13:09,468
<i>I'm prepping the bomb pack.</i>

498
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:11,137
Nyssa.

499
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:35,953
Get out!

500
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,580
Right now.

501
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:42,335
No!

502
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:48,049
No!

503
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:53,721
I'll attract them to me.
Do what I tell you. Move!

504
01:13:57,308 --> 01:13:58,893
Ten...

505
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:00,102
...nine...

506
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:02,021
...eight...

507
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:04,065
...seven...

508
01:14:04,482 --> 01:14:05,775
...six...

509
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:08,486
...five...

510
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:10,863
...four...

511
01:14:11,238 --> 01:14:12,448
...three...

512
01:14:13,658 --> 01:14:15,034
...two...

513
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:19,205
...one.

514
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:45,231
Piece of junk.

515
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:01,080
What the hell is this?

516
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:04,959
You trying to stink me to death, old man?

517
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:17,388
Wait!

518
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:21,434
- You okay?
- Yeah.

519
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,062
We gotta move.
We got a lot of company.

520
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:31,318
All units, regroup. Regroup!

521
01:15:56,677 --> 01:16:00,806
Eat shit, you ugly motherfuckers!

522
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:04,477
There's nobody left!

523
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,774
Aah! Unh.

524
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:27,083
- Where's the bomb pack?
- Had to leave it down that tunnel.

525
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:29,126
Give me the rest of the pheromones.

526
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,840
Go down that tunnel. Go, go, go!

527
01:16:37,051 --> 01:16:43,140
You obviously do not know
who you are fucking with!

528
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:22,930
By the way, Blade, did I happen
to mention the bomb lever is stuck?

529
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:30,437
Suck this!

530
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:35,234
Let's go!

531
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:17,526
You want a bite of me? Well, come on!

532
01:18:18,235 --> 01:18:19,570
Come on, motherfucker!

533
01:19:38,524 --> 01:19:40,150
Whistler.

534
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:41,694
Wait.

535
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:44,488
You will survive this...

536
01:19:44,655 --> 01:19:46,949
...only to tell Blade...

537
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:49,285
...about this ring.

538
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:55,124
About the truth. The truth, old man.

539
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:57,626
Damaskinos...

540
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:08,512
Nyssa.

541
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:38,602
You've done a great job.

542
01:21:40,187 --> 01:21:42,648
Not that great, I'd say.

543
01:22:05,129 --> 01:22:09,299
What is it, my daughter?

544
01:22:58,557 --> 01:23:02,603
They took them. All our weapons.
Even your sword.

545
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:05,105
Somebody's been keeping
tabs on us from inside.

546
01:23:05,272 --> 01:23:06,440
Where are we?

547
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:09,193
Some kind of chamber deep in their lair.

548
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:14,698
They smashed up everything,
the workshop, all of it.

549
01:23:14,865 --> 01:23:18,368
They've been lying to us from day one.

550
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:21,205
The Reaper strain didn't evolve.

551
01:23:21,371 --> 01:23:22,789
It was designed.

552
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:26,960
- What?
- Designed. Nomak told me.

553
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:30,380
I saw him back in the sewers.
He let me live.

554
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:32,132
Did he?

555
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:34,801
How generous of him.

556
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:40,098
I brought you here to see
the fruits of our labor.

557
01:23:42,643 --> 01:23:49,233
For years I've struggled to rid our kind
of any hereditary weaknesses.

558
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:56,323
And so recombining DNA was
simply the next logical step.

559
01:23:58,742 --> 01:24:02,454
Nomak was the first. A failure.

560
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:07,751
But in time, there will be
a new pure race...

561
01:24:07,918 --> 01:24:09,962
...begotten from my own flesh...

562
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:13,131
...immune to silver...

563
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:16,093
...soon even sunlight.

564
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:19,721
I got a question for you,
you lying son of a bitch.

565
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:23,600
You want to explain how Nomak
got ahold of this ring?

566
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:36,238
I would have thought that was
obvious at this point.

567
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:41,243
I gave it to him, of course.
A gift from father to son.

568
01:24:53,297 --> 01:24:55,465
I thought he'd never leave.

569
01:25:00,804 --> 01:25:04,808
The wolf has lain with the sheep
long enough.

570
01:25:04,975 --> 01:25:09,646
Reinhardt, you can kiss your ass goodbye.

571
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:17,821
Oh, huh. I'm sorry, man.

572
01:25:17,988 --> 01:25:22,034
B, you're wasting your time, man.
The bomb's a dud.

573
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,369
It was never supposed to explode.

574
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:27,789
It was just supposed
to make you feel in control.

575
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:31,877
You thought you had me
on a short leash, didn't you, jefe?

576
01:25:39,259 --> 01:25:40,302
Much better.

577
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:44,973
See this?

578
01:25:46,516 --> 01:25:48,185
I'm one of Damaskinos' familiars.

579
01:25:49,311 --> 01:25:51,897
They needed my help to bring
you here to control Nomak.

580
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:54,232
The old fuck, he was always just bait.

581
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:58,195
I mean, look at him.
He's your only real weakness, man.

582
01:25:58,362 --> 01:26:01,782
You may be fast, you may be strong
and all that other bullshit...

583
01:26:01,948 --> 01:26:04,743
...but in the end, B,
you're just too human.

584
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:08,538
Well, you little shit.

585
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:09,748
- Heh.
- Unh.

586
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:15,796
You think they scoped out
my security system?

587
01:26:15,962 --> 01:26:18,799
I let them in, asshole!

588
01:26:18,965 --> 01:26:21,218
I practically handed them the keys.

589
01:26:21,385 --> 01:26:22,761
You heard Cue Ball, right?

590
01:26:22,928 --> 01:26:25,555
Pretty soon they're all
gonna be daywalkers, man.

591
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:29,017
When that happens,
I'd rather be a pet than cattle.

592
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:30,977
You got me, B?

593
01:26:33,063 --> 01:26:36,983
- What do you think about that, man?
- Two things.

594
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:42,155
One, I've been onto you
since they turned you.

595
01:26:43,365 --> 01:26:44,783
And two...

596
01:26:46,493 --> 01:26:48,078
...it's not a dud.

597
01:26:48,745 --> 01:26:50,038
Oh, great.

598
01:26:58,755 --> 01:27:00,674
I was just starting to like him.

599
01:27:00,841 --> 01:27:02,467
Take him down!

600
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:39,546
We're going to harvest your blood,
every drop of it.

601
01:27:39,713 --> 01:27:43,633
Then bone marrow, organs, everything.

602
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:48,180
We'll find the missing key
to creating daywalkers.

603
01:27:55,312 --> 01:27:57,147
Now, this might hurt a bit.

604
01:28:01,651 --> 01:28:03,528
Nice.

605
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:06,198
I wonder...

606
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:09,868
...how many vampires
he's killed with this thing.

607
01:28:10,035 --> 01:28:11,745
Not nearly enough, Fritz.

608
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:14,956
Keep talking, honky-tonk.

609
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:18,960
Just makes my sending you
to the next world all the sweeter.

610
01:28:19,461 --> 01:28:21,338
Been there, done that.

611
01:28:21,505 --> 01:28:25,759
Do your worst, chickenshit.
We'll settle up after.

612
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:49,825
What else should I find out?

613
01:28:50,784 --> 01:28:52,577
I trusted you...

614
01:28:53,203 --> 01:28:55,121
...with my men...

615
01:28:55,622 --> 01:28:57,541
...with my will...

616
01:28:58,041 --> 01:29:00,001
...with my life.

617
01:29:01,211 --> 01:29:04,256
You, you sent us out there.

618
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,386
You sent me to die.

619
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:16,768
Our enemy saved my life twice,
and you have used us...

620
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:18,687
...your own children.

621
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:22,440
Make no mistake, Nyssa.

622
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:25,235
Those blood ties mean nothing to me...

623
01:29:25,402 --> 01:29:27,821
...when measured against
the ascendancy of our race.

624
01:29:30,574 --> 01:29:35,453
Who do you think God
really favors in the web?

625
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:39,833
The spider or the fly?

626
01:29:45,005 --> 01:29:48,258
- Nomak.
- Hmm?

627
01:29:52,262 --> 01:29:53,847
What about him?

628
01:29:54,806 --> 01:29:57,434
He wants revenge...

629
01:29:57,601 --> 01:30:03,356
...on the people who created him.

630
01:30:03,523 --> 01:30:05,567
You may be right.

631
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:10,113
But fortunately for us,
he doesn't know this location.

632
01:30:12,449 --> 01:30:14,534
Now...

633
01:30:15,911 --> 01:30:17,162
...he does.

634
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:47,692
What the fuck?

635
01:31:42,455 --> 01:31:46,126
Come on, kid. Don't you even
think about dying on me.

636
01:31:47,627 --> 01:31:51,631
You didn't give up on me,
I won't give up on you.

637
01:31:51,798 --> 01:31:54,718
Come on, Blade.

638
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:03,935
Blood.

639
01:32:05,729 --> 01:32:06,980
Yeah.

640
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:09,065
Blood.

641
01:32:44,976 --> 01:32:46,561
Father!

642
01:32:46,936 --> 01:32:49,439
He'll never enter here.

643
01:32:55,904 --> 01:32:57,447
Father!

644
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:25,475
Father!

645
01:33:53,503 --> 01:33:54,838
Go on, kid.

646
01:33:58,341 --> 01:33:59,676
Go!

647
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:19,274
Go! Get him!

648
01:36:32,662 --> 01:36:33,913
Get in there!

649
01:36:49,012 --> 01:36:50,346
Hmm.

650
01:36:51,264 --> 01:36:56,269
Well, like my daddy said right
before he killed my mom:

651
01:36:56,436 --> 01:36:58,980
"Want anything done right,
you gotta do it yourself."

652
01:37:03,276 --> 01:37:04,736
He also said...

653
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:22,795
Can you blush?

654
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:38,269
Hey, kid.

655
01:38:18,601 --> 01:38:21,354
I reset the security code.

656
01:38:22,355 --> 01:38:26,818
- We're locked in.
- Are you insane?!

657
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:30,613
- He'll kill us both.
- Yes.

658
01:38:32,532 --> 01:38:36,327
Isn't it sad that you die
not by the hand of your enemy...

659
01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:38,913
...but by that of your own children?

660
01:38:48,965 --> 01:38:50,508
Father.

661
01:40:24,894 --> 01:40:26,646
Nyssa.

662
01:41:16,612 --> 01:41:17,905
Nomak!

663
01:41:22,535 --> 01:41:25,037
Blade, it could end right here.

664
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:28,207
What do you think, huh?

665
01:44:24,008 --> 01:44:28,304
After all, it looks like I've
finished my father's job.

666
01:45:28,239 --> 01:45:31,617
It's strange.

667
01:45:33,285 --> 01:45:34,495
It hurts...

668
01:45:34,995 --> 01:45:37,289
It hurts no more.

669
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:38,851
It won't be long.

670
01:46:39,935 --> 01:46:43,439
I can already feel it
burning inside of me.

671
01:46:47,026 --> 01:46:50,529
I want to die while I'm still a vampire.

672
01:47:03,709 --> 01:47:06,128
I want to see the sun.

673
01:48:40,764 --> 01:48:44,351
Go to booth number three. Enjoy, man.

674
01:48:49,773 --> 01:48:53,610
Are you sure, uh,
that the girls are live?

675
01:48:54,069 --> 01:48:57,239
- Last time I checked.
- Thank you.

676
01:48:57,781 --> 01:49:01,285
A couple of razor blades, just in case.

677
01:49:08,459 --> 01:49:11,045
Oh, you didn't think I forgot
about you, did you?
