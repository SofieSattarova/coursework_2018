3
00:00:58,676 --> 00:01:00,577
Mutants...

4
00:01:00,578 --> 00:01:04,148
born with extraordinary abilities...

5
00:01:04,348 --> 00:01:08,810
and yet, still, they are children
stumbling in the dark...

6
00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:11,084
searching for guidance.

7
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:15,630
A gift can often be a curse.

8
00:01:16,193 --> 00:01:21,094
Give someone wings,
and they may fly too close to the sun.

9
00:01:22,391 --> 00:01:24,867
Give them the power of prophecy...

10
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:27,812
and they may live in fear
of the future.

11
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:30,565
Give them the greatest
gifts of all...

12
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:33,956
powers beyond imagination...

13
00:01:33,981 --> 00:01:38,377
and they may think they're meant
to rule the world.

14
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:56,733
En Sabah Nur.
En Sabah Nur.

15
00:01:56,758 --> 00:02:02,880
En Sabah Nur.
En Sabah Nur.

16
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:09,238
En Sabah Nur.
En Sabah Nur.

17
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:15,569
En Sabah Nur.
En Sabah Nur.

18
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:22,253
En Sabah Nur.
En Sabah Nur.

19
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,470
Now you will rule for eternity, my lord.

20
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:39,644
Sleep.

21
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:45,575
Let the transference begin.

22
00:05:10,318 --> 00:05:12,088
Watch out!

23
00:05:13,367 --> 00:05:16,435
Death to the false god.

24
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:28,731
The pyramid!
The pyramid is collapsing!

25
00:05:28,756 --> 00:05:32,820
- Run.
- Run for your lives.

26
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:38,321
Protect him!

27
00:08:19,774 --> 00:08:23,619
As everyone knows, the existence
of mutants was first discovered...

28
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,165
during the Paris Peace Accords,
after the Vietnam War in 1973.

29
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:32,286
Six days later, we all watched
as one of those mutants...

30
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,381
Erik Lehnsherr, attacked the President...

31
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:38,092
and the Cabinet on the lawn
of the White House.

32
00:08:38,093 --> 00:08:42,221
Their lives were saved
by a young mutant who stopped him.

33
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:45,570
Now, Lehnsherr escaped and became
the world's most-wanted fugitive.

34
00:08:45,595 --> 00:08:48,185
And as for her,
she disappeared as well.

35
00:08:48,186 --> 00:08:51,522
But she has become the symbol
of a new age...

36
00:08:51,523 --> 00:08:54,108
the face of a world
that will never be the same again.

37
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,747
You winking at my girl?

38
00:08:55,772 --> 00:08:57,120
Yes, the world is panicked.

39
00:08:57,145 --> 00:08:58,755
Your girl?

40
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,750
I guess you do look old enough
to be her father.

41
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,005
Excuse me, gentlemen...
is there something you'd

42
00:09:04,008 --> 00:09:05,808
like to be sharing with
the rest of the class?

43
00:09:05,822 --> 00:09:07,922
Can I please go to the bathroom?

44
00:09:07,973 --> 00:09:10,443
I think there's something
seriously wrong with my eyes.

45
00:09:10,476 --> 00:09:12,185
Fine, Scott.
And afterwards...

46
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,690
why don't you stop by the principal's
office and explain to him...

47
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,909
that you're disrupting class again?

48
00:09:17,549 --> 00:09:19,059
I trust you know the way.

49
00:09:19,084 --> 00:09:21,445
- Yeah, I do.
- Okay.

50
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,467
No, hang on!
Hang on!

51
00:09:27,392 --> 00:09:28,601
Hey!

52
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:30,181
Now, I know most of you were, what?

53
00:09:30,206 --> 00:09:33,514
Around seven years old
at that time?

54
00:09:42,975 --> 00:09:44,997
Summers!

55
00:09:45,994 --> 00:09:48,379
I know you're in here.

56
00:09:49,778 --> 00:09:51,499
What, are you crying?

57
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,869
I haven't even kicked your ass yet.

58
00:09:55,447 --> 00:09:58,456
Summers!
You want to eyeball my girl?

59
00:10:02,205 --> 00:10:03,837
Summers.

60
00:10:06,754 --> 00:10:07,882
Summers!

61
00:10:07,912 --> 00:10:11,947
STOP!!!

62
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,262
Yeah!

63
00:10:46,263 --> 00:10:47,930
Ten fights waged.

64
00:10:47,931 --> 00:10:49,557
Ten fights won.

65
00:10:49,558 --> 00:10:51,809
The Winged Warrior.

66
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,435
The Bird of Prey.

67
00:10:53,436 --> 00:10:54,770
The Angel of Death.

68
00:10:54,771 --> 00:10:56,605
ANGEL!

69
00:10:56,606 --> 00:10:58,571
Yeah!

70
00:11:02,946 --> 00:11:06,532
Let's hear it
for the fat man!

71
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:09,285
Our next challenger...

72
00:11:09,286 --> 00:11:10,953
comes straight...

73
00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:14,725
from the Munich Circus.

74
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,768
Ladies and gentlemen,

75
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:19,546
the only one that could take on an Angel...

76
00:11:19,571 --> 00:11:22,199
is the Devil himself.

77
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:25,261
I give you...

78
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:27,308
the amazing...

79
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,653
the fantastic...

80
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:33,685
NIGHTCRAWLER!

81
00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:52,745
Caution.

82
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,455
High voltage!

83
00:11:54,456 --> 00:11:57,150
Sorry mutants!

84
00:12:11,681 --> 00:12:12,973
Hey.

85
00:12:12,974 --> 00:12:15,059
Did you get lost little mouse?

86
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,375
The fight is over there.

87
00:12:19,522 --> 00:12:20,606
Fight!

88
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,535
Or they'll kill us both!

89
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:27,370
And it's about to get exciting.

90
00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:29,354
Ah, you mean this?

91
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:30,666
Yes?

92
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:52,246
Nightcrawler!

93
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,894
Nightcrawler!
Nightcrawler!

94
00:12:58,895 --> 00:12:59,895
I'm sorry.

95
00:12:59,896 --> 00:13:01,954
I'm sorry!

96
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:43,563
They went that way!

97
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:50,672
You can...

98
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,072
transform.

99
00:13:52,073 --> 00:13:53,240
You're her.

100
00:13:53,241 --> 00:13:54,658
- The hero.
- I'm nobody.

101
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:55,826
I'm not a hero.

102
00:13:55,827 --> 00:13:57,494
Let's get out of here.

103
00:14:19,642 --> 00:14:20,809
Have a good night, Henryk.

104
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,011
You too, Milosz.

105
00:14:51,883 --> 00:14:53,342
Hi Honey.

106
00:14:53,343 --> 00:14:54,877
Hi.

107
00:14:58,473 --> 00:14:59,881
Good day?

108
00:14:59,906 --> 00:15:01,778
Better now.

109
00:15:01,893 --> 00:15:02,999
Where's Nina?

110
00:15:03,024 --> 00:15:05,977
Out back.
With her friends.

111
00:15:08,918 --> 00:15:10,767
Don't worry.

112
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:13,357
There is enough for everyone.

113
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:21,189
Close your eyes now.

114
00:15:21,214 --> 00:15:25,103
Go to sleep

115
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:33,889
and have a sweet dream.

116
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:37,048
Where did you learn that song, Papa?

117
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:40,544
I learned it from my parents.

118
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:43,317
And they learned it from their parents.

119
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,762
And them from theirs.

120
00:15:46,896 --> 00:15:48,590
And one day...

121
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,659
you'll sing it to your children, too.

122
00:15:52,777 --> 00:15:54,236
What happened to them?

123
00:15:54,237 --> 00:15:56,154
Your parents.

124
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,577
They were taken from me...

125
00:16:01,578 --> 00:16:03,780
when I was a little boy.

126
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,660
But they're still here.

127
00:16:08,793 --> 00:16:10,665
Inside.

128
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,460
And here.

129
00:16:15,091 --> 00:16:16,592
With you.

130
00:16:16,593 --> 00:16:20,467
Is someone going to take you away?

131
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,292
Never.

132
00:16:39,115 --> 00:16:41,173
I guess we're more alike
than we thought.

133
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:43,074
He won't listen to us.

134
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:44,724
He's just...
He's being...

135
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:46,541
Scott.

136
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,028
Let me try.

137
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,567
Smells pretty old in here.

138
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:08,277
Is this a school or a museum?

139
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:11,458
One more.
And last one.

140
00:17:11,483 --> 00:17:13,526
There you go.

141
00:17:13,694 --> 00:17:14,773
I'll see you guys.

142
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:15,978
Oh.

143
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:26,445
Watch where you're going.

144
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:28,147
I can't.

145
00:17:28,285 --> 00:17:29,906
What?
Who are you talking to?

146
00:17:29,907 --> 00:17:31,574
Me.

147
00:17:32,717 --> 00:17:34,921
I just heard you in my head.

148
00:17:34,946 --> 00:17:36,780
I'm telepathic.
I read minds.

149
00:17:36,781 --> 00:17:37,948
Well, stay out of mine.

150
00:17:37,949 --> 00:17:40,844
I don't need some weird girl
creeping around in there.

151
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:43,651
Don't worry, Scott.
There's not much to see.

152
00:17:43,955 --> 00:17:46,125
Hey, wait.
I didn't tell you my name.

153
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,397
No, you didn't.

154
00:17:48,877 --> 00:17:50,874
Alex Summers?

155
00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:52,527
Hank McCoy!

156
00:17:52,552 --> 00:17:55,299
Whoa! What happened to the
big, blue, furry you'?

157
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,964
I keep him under control now.

158
00:17:58,761 --> 00:18:00,179
This is my brother, Scott.

159
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,461
Hey, Scott. I'm Hank McCoy.
I'm one of the teachers here.

160
00:18:05,678 --> 00:18:06,894
Where's the professor?

161
00:18:06,895 --> 00:18:10,856
"To break forth bloodily,
then the past must be obliterated...

162
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:13,150
"and a new start made.

163
00:18:13,151 --> 00:18:14,818
"Let us now start fresh...

164
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:16,904
"without remembrance...

165
00:18:16,905 --> 00:18:21,283
"rather than live forward and backward
at the same time."

166
00:18:21,284 --> 00:18:24,569
Now, what on earth do we think
that the author meant...

167
00:18:24,594 --> 00:18:26,671
when he wrote all that?

168
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:31,011
That's going to be
your assignment for tomorrow.

169
00:18:31,036 --> 00:18:34,236
Top marks, everyone.
Class dismissed.

170
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:35,672
Alex.

171
00:18:35,673 --> 00:18:37,707
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

172
00:18:37,732 --> 00:18:39,644
You look well.
It's been a while.

173
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:41,373
It has.
Not too bad yourself.

174
00:18:41,398 --> 00:18:42,739
Thank you.

175
00:18:42,764 --> 00:18:45,158
This is my brother, Scott.

176
00:18:45,183 --> 00:18:48,389
Hello, Scott.
Welcome to the School for the Gifted.

177
00:18:48,414 --> 00:18:51,497
Yeah.
It doesn't exactly feel like a gift.

178
00:18:51,522 --> 00:18:54,224
It never does, at first.

179
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:58,695
The first step in
understanding one's power...

180
00:18:58,696 --> 00:19:00,697
is learning the extent of it.

181
00:19:00,698 --> 00:19:03,951
Only then can we begin the process
of teaching you how to control it.

182
00:19:03,952 --> 00:19:06,912
If you do decide to stay,
I can promise you...

183
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:10,507
that by the time you're done here,
you'll be able to go back into the world...

184
00:19:10,532 --> 00:19:12,960
and play a stable and
productive part in it.

185
00:19:12,961 --> 00:19:14,336
Why don't you take your bandages off...

186
00:19:14,337 --> 00:19:17,047
and we can have a look
at what we're dealing with here?

187
00:19:17,048 --> 00:19:20,588
Alex, would you line him up?
Face him in the right direction, as it were.

188
00:19:20,613 --> 00:19:22,205
There's a target just
across the water.

189
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,573
When you open your eyes,
try and hit that.

190
00:19:27,684 --> 00:19:29,726
You can open your eyes, Scott.

191
00:19:29,727 --> 00:19:32,600
There's nothing to be afraid of.
It's quite...

192
00:19:38,152 --> 00:19:39,861
Look out!
Get back!

193
00:19:39,862 --> 00:19:42,054
Get back!
Get back!

194
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:45,433
Whoa.

195
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:50,232
My grandfather planted that tree
when he was five years old.

196
00:19:50,257 --> 00:19:53,830
I used to swing...
from the branches of it, myself.

197
00:19:56,906 --> 00:19:59,448
I think that was probably
my favorite tree.

198
00:20:00,351 --> 00:20:01,967
Does that mean I'm expelled?

199
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:03,885
On the contrary.

200
00:20:04,657 --> 00:20:06,624
You're enrolled.

201
00:20:55,371 --> 00:20:57,080
Do you sell rugs?

202
00:20:57,081 --> 00:20:59,374
You're not allowed in this area.

203
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,376
This rug is for sale?

204
00:21:01,377 --> 00:21:02,748
I said, this...

205
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,662
Good morning.
My lord, En Sabah Nur.

206
00:22:21,545 --> 00:22:23,522
Oh, mighty lord.

207
00:22:23,547 --> 00:22:27,783
Grant us with your power.
Grant us with your authority.

208
00:22:32,003 --> 00:22:35,898
The great,
all mighty lord.

209
00:22:35,923 --> 00:22:39,569
Grant us with your power.
Grant us with your authority.

210
00:22:39,594 --> 00:22:41,918
We are your loyal followers.

211
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:44,309
En Sabah Nur.
En Sabah Nur.

212
00:22:44,634 --> 00:22:48,385
The great,
all mighty lord.

213
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:52,303
Grant us with your power.
Grant us with your authority.

214
00:22:52,328 --> 00:22:53,872
Look, quick.

215
00:22:53,897 --> 00:22:56,200
Everyone, look.

216
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:58,863
En Sabah Nur.

217
00:22:58,888 --> 00:23:02,223
The great,
all mighty lord.

218
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:05,958
Grant us with your power.
Grant us with your authority.

219
00:23:05,983 --> 00:23:08,180
En Sabah Nur.
En Sabah Nur.

220
00:23:08,205 --> 00:23:11,990
The great,
all mighty lord.

221
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:16,347
Grant us with your power.
Grant us with your authority.

222
00:24:05,745 --> 00:24:07,355
Lord!

223
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,326
What's happening?

224
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,527
En Sabah Nur.
En Sabah Nur.

225
00:24:25,574 --> 00:24:27,608
Something's wrong.
No. No.

226
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,625
- Run!
- Quick, run!

227
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,949
Earthquake!

228
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:53,752
Back to bed, please, my darling.
Back to bed.

229
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:55,011
She's doing it again.

230
00:25:55,036 --> 00:25:56,745
Back to bed, please, everyone.

231
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,125
Jesse, back to bed, please.

232
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,817
Come on now.
Spit-spot, back to bed.

233
00:25:59,842 --> 00:26:02,369
Carrie Anne, come on now.
Back to bed.

234
00:26:10,075 --> 00:26:11,741
Never seen it like this.

235
00:26:11,766 --> 00:26:13,683
Nor I.

236
00:26:14,028 --> 00:26:16,665
Don't let any of the children
come this way.

237
00:26:36,454 --> 00:26:38,155
Jean.

238
00:26:59,358 --> 00:27:01,627
Jean!

239
00:27:02,802 --> 00:27:05,592
Jean!

240
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,671
I saw the end of the world.

241
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:17,218
I could feel...

242
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:20,092
all this death.

243
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:23,224
It was just a dream.

244
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:25,060
No, it felt real.

245
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:26,769
I know.

246
00:27:26,794 --> 00:27:30,023
Your mind is the most powerful
I've ever seen.

247
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:31,316
It can convince itself...

248
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:32,099
No, no...

249
00:27:32,124 --> 00:27:35,681
It's not just the mind-reading
or the telekinesis...

250
00:27:35,706 --> 00:27:37,908
it's something else.

251
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:43,533
Some dark power inside
and it's growing.

252
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:45,741
Like a fire.

253
00:27:45,891 --> 00:27:47,526
I thought I was getting better.

254
00:27:47,551 --> 00:27:48,944
You are.

255
00:27:48,969 --> 00:27:50,886
You will.

256
00:27:50,911 --> 00:27:52,120
You just have to be patient.

257
00:27:52,121 --> 00:27:55,783
No, no. You don't know what it's like
to be afraid to shut your eyes.

258
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:57,911
To be trapped inside
your own head.

259
00:27:57,936 --> 00:28:00,332
Oh, I think I do.

260
00:28:00,551 --> 00:28:04,767
It wasn't so long ago that
I was plagued by voices, myself.

261
00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:06,593
All their suffering.

262
00:28:06,594 --> 00:28:08,341
All their pain.

263
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,796
Their secrets.

264
00:28:13,475 --> 00:28:16,979
I'm afraid one day
I'm going to hurt someone.

265
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:21,783
Lie back.

266
00:28:31,218 --> 00:28:35,468
Everyone fears that
which they do not understand.

267
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:39,600
You will learn to control your powers.

268
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:41,761
And when you do...

269
00:28:42,104 --> 00:28:44,647
you'll have nothing to fear.

270
00:28:46,223 --> 00:28:48,067
Her nightmares were different this time.

271
00:28:48,068 --> 00:28:50,897
Well, it could account for something I saw
when I was in my lab earlier.

272
00:28:50,907 --> 00:28:53,511
There was some kind of tremor.
Like an energy surge.

273
00:28:53,536 --> 00:28:54,956
I picked it up
on one of my meters.

274
00:28:54,981 --> 00:28:56,711
You're saying that Jean created it?

275
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:58,211
No. I'm saying something else did.

276
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,602
Maybe she was reacting to it.
I don't know.

277
00:29:00,627 --> 00:29:02,467
But the epicenter was
halfway around the world.

278
00:29:02,477 --> 00:29:04,014
- Halfway around the world?
- Yeah.

279
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:05,797
That's why I was hoping you could
take a look.

280
00:29:05,807 --> 00:29:08,029
Let's see what we can find.

281
00:29:10,466 --> 00:29:12,780
Welcome, Professor.

282
00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:25,351
Okay, the source came from Cairo.

283
00:29:26,612 --> 00:29:28,709
I'll put in the coordinates.

284
00:29:53,008 --> 00:29:55,319
I gotta get out of here.

285
00:29:55,344 --> 00:29:57,359
Give them a report.

286
00:29:58,765 --> 00:30:00,264
What?
What is it?

287
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:04,242
Something happened here.
I can tell them it's real.

288
00:30:05,124 --> 00:30:06,708
It's her.

289
00:30:06,733 --> 00:30:08,184
Who?

290
00:30:09,024 --> 00:30:10,483
- Moira.
- What?

291
00:30:10,484 --> 00:30:12,461
Moira MacTaggert?

292
00:30:12,486 --> 00:30:13,898
Give me the details.

293
00:30:13,923 --> 00:30:16,329
She looks amazing.
She's barely aged a day.

294
00:30:16,354 --> 00:30:18,397
No.
I meant...

295
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,242
What is she doing there?
What does the CIA want with this?

296
00:30:21,267 --> 00:30:25,182
She's going back to Langley
to deliver a report.

297
00:30:25,207 --> 00:30:26,563
I'm going to go there...

298
00:30:26,588 --> 00:30:28,876
see if she knows something
about the tremor.

299
00:30:28,877 --> 00:30:30,628
And you want
to go see Moira.

300
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:32,505
I want to go check her out.
Check out...

301
00:30:32,506 --> 00:30:34,332
the situation.

302
00:30:37,386 --> 00:30:39,282
Moira MacTaggert.

303
00:30:41,063 --> 00:30:43,481
It's like a ghost from the past.

304
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,728
You did a good thing.
You saved that man.

305
00:30:47,729 --> 00:30:49,601
That's not the point.

306
00:30:49,626 --> 00:30:51,496
If I'm exposed, we're all exposed.

307
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:53,222
We have to go.

308
00:30:53,313 --> 00:30:55,337
This is our home.

309
00:30:55,362 --> 00:30:57,238
This is our daughter's home.

310
00:30:57,239 --> 00:30:59,862
We are her home.

311
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:04,245
I told you who I was,
the first night I met you.

312
00:31:04,246 --> 00:31:06,080
I trusted you then.

313
00:31:06,081 --> 00:31:08,783
I need you to trust me now.

314
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:11,862
We can't stay here anymore.

315
00:31:16,258 --> 00:31:18,082
I'll get Nina.

316
00:31:20,095 --> 00:31:22,047
Sweetheart.

317
00:31:32,274 --> 00:31:33,923
She's not in her room.

318
00:31:33,948 --> 00:31:36,004
And I don't see her out back.

319
00:31:43,577 --> 00:31:44,785
Nina?

320
00:31:44,786 --> 00:31:46,287
Nina!

321
00:31:46,288 --> 00:31:47,371
Nina!

322
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:48,914
Nina!

323
00:31:54,087 --> 00:31:56,164
Nina!

324
00:32:16,662 --> 00:32:17,902
Nina.

325
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:19,779
Are you alright?

326
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,113
She's fine.

327
00:32:21,114 --> 00:32:22,218
Then let her go!

328
00:32:22,243 --> 00:32:24,091
We will.

329
00:32:24,451 --> 00:32:26,963
We just wanted to have a word.

330
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:32,124
You're not wearing your badges.

331
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:34,192
No metal.

332
00:32:34,962 --> 00:32:37,880
Some guys at the factory said
they saw something today.

333
00:32:37,881 --> 00:32:40,341
Something that didn't add up.

334
00:32:40,342 --> 00:32:42,009
Put your weapons away.

335
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,679
You've been a good citizen, Henryk...

336
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,181
A good neighbor...
a good worker.

337
00:32:47,182 --> 00:32:49,016
I want to believe
that's who you are.

338
00:32:49,017 --> 00:32:50,184
It is.

339
00:32:50,185 --> 00:32:52,830
But nobody in this town
really knows you.

340
00:32:52,855 --> 00:32:54,926
Yes you do.

341
00:32:55,357 --> 00:32:57,441
I am Henryk Gurzsky.

342
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,989
Jakob, I've had dinner in your home...

343
00:33:00,014 --> 00:33:02,238
And you were lying
the whole time.

344
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:04,948
I brought a killer
into my house.

345
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,461
Is this you?

346
00:33:12,916 --> 00:33:15,809
Are you the one
they call Magneto?

347
00:33:36,106 --> 00:33:38,774
Take me in.

348
00:33:38,775 --> 00:33:39,650
Please...

349
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:42,215
Just let my daughter go.

350
00:33:52,164 --> 00:33:54,199
Go with your mother.

351
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:04,070
Please...!

352
00:34:04,384 --> 00:34:06,719
Don't leave me.

353
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,023
I'm not going to
let them take you.

354
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:11,719
Nina. Nina, please.
Please.

355
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,733
Nina.

356
00:34:14,758 --> 00:34:16,024
Nina.

357
00:34:16,049 --> 00:34:16,906
Please.

358
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:18,272
What's going on?

359
00:34:18,273 --> 00:34:20,130
She's one of them?

360
00:34:20,155 --> 00:34:21,626
Please.

361
00:34:21,651 --> 00:34:22,693
Tell her to stop!

362
00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:24,113
She can't control it!

363
00:34:24,138 --> 00:34:25,649
- Nina.
- Please.

364
00:34:25,674 --> 00:34:27,329
She's scared of you!

365
00:34:27,354 --> 00:34:32,181
I'm not going to let them take you!
I'm not going to let them take you!

366
00:34:36,249 --> 00:34:38,213
Make her stop!

367
00:34:39,148 --> 00:34:41,475
Nina!
Nina!

368
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,962
Please stop.

369
00:34:44,164 --> 00:34:46,371
Please stop, Nina!

370
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:03,484
Nina.

371
00:35:03,485 --> 00:35:05,425
Nina, Nina, no...

372
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,809
No, please.
Please! Please.

373
00:35:07,834 --> 00:35:10,402
- What have you done?
- Please don't leave me.

374
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:12,276
Please.

375
00:35:12,285 --> 00:35:15,317
Please.
Please.

376
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:24,004
Not my babies.

377
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:31,091
Not my babies.

378
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:15,691
IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT FROM ME?

379
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:19,935
Is this what I am?

380
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:29,065
Is this what I am?

381
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:36,066
God damn thief.
Stop that thief.

382
00:37:38,405 --> 00:37:41,830
Stop her.
Stop that thief!

383
00:37:44,147 --> 00:37:46,772
You know what we do to thieves.

384
00:37:46,773 --> 00:37:48,190
Pick a hand.

385
00:37:48,191 --> 00:37:50,017
Enough.

386
00:37:52,183 --> 00:37:54,435
If you're with her, I suggest you walk away.

387
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,754
While you still can.

388
00:37:58,493 --> 00:38:00,160
Walk away.

389
00:38:00,823 --> 00:38:05,392
Who rules this world?

390
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:07,555
What language is that?

391
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,325
Clown-face.
What's the deal?

392
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:14,176
Beat it!

393
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:30,936
I'm sorry.

394
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,278
I'm sorry.

395
00:38:36,443 --> 00:38:40,397
You can't feel it, can you?

396
00:38:52,172 --> 00:38:55,625
Now you feel it.

397
00:39:04,127 --> 00:39:06,352
So you really haven't seen her
in all these years'?

398
00:39:06,353 --> 00:39:09,155
You never looked her up?
Not even in Cerebro?

399
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,035
Alex! What do you take me for,
some kind of pervert?

400
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,861
Yes, I looked her up once.
Twice.

401
00:39:13,886 --> 00:39:15,637
But not in a long time, all right?

402
00:39:15,662 --> 00:39:18,590
How did you leave things?
Any hard feelings?

403
00:39:18,615 --> 00:39:19,653
Not likely.

404
00:39:19,678 --> 00:39:21,971
Everybody take a break.

405
00:39:22,811 --> 00:39:25,829
I wiped her mind
of all memories of us.

406
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,842
The beach, Cuba...
that whole time.

407
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,992
It was so long ago, Alex.

408
00:39:31,017 --> 00:39:32,585
Before the world knew about mutants.

409
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:36,378
I felt it was the
best thing for her.

410
00:39:36,403 --> 00:39:38,395
And for you?

411
00:39:40,387 --> 00:39:43,214
Didn't really matter
what was best for me.

412
00:39:46,462 --> 00:39:48,060
Moira...

413
00:39:48,061 --> 00:39:50,565
MacTaggert, hello!

414
00:39:52,838 --> 00:39:54,584
Oh, Jeez.
What the devil?

415
00:39:54,609 --> 00:39:56,110
Allow me to introduce myself.

416
00:39:56,111 --> 00:39:58,070
- I'm Professor...
- Charles Xavier.

417
00:39:58,071 --> 00:40:00,447
- I know exactly who you are.
- You do?

418
00:40:00,448 --> 00:40:02,116
Of course I do.

419
00:40:02,117 --> 00:40:04,565
I have read all of your papers.

420
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:07,454
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

421
00:40:07,686 --> 00:40:08,865
Moira MacTaggert.

422
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,416
- Alex Summers.
- Have a seat.

423
00:40:10,417 --> 00:40:13,030
Just throw that on the floor.

424
00:40:13,461 --> 00:40:14,838
It's wonderful to see you again.

425
00:40:14,863 --> 00:40:17,631
To meet you again,
for the first time.

426
00:40:17,632 --> 00:40:19,632
You've got a son?

427
00:40:20,482 --> 00:40:21,516
Yes.

428
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:23,865
Does he have a husband?

429
00:40:25,174 --> 00:40:27,266
Do you have a husband?

430
00:40:27,267 --> 00:40:28,720
I had a husband...

431
00:40:28,745 --> 00:40:31,682
but it's hard to do this job
and make it home in time for dinner.

432
00:40:31,707 --> 00:40:32,707
Good, good.

433
00:40:32,732 --> 00:40:34,958
We all make choices, right?

434
00:40:34,983 --> 00:40:37,606
Yes, we do.

435
00:40:38,831 --> 00:40:41,841
- Professor.
- Yes?

436
00:40:42,124 --> 00:40:43,244
Yes.

437
00:40:43,269 --> 00:40:45,823
I was, we were hoping that you would...

438
00:40:45,848 --> 00:40:48,805
tell us about what happened
yesterday in Egypt.

439
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:51,624
I'm afraid that's classified information.

440
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:54,457
And, I don't mean to be rude, but...

441
00:40:54,713 --> 00:40:56,837
how did you get in here?

442
00:40:56,862 --> 00:40:59,314
I have level-five clearance.

443
00:41:00,751 --> 00:41:03,711
Ever since the world found out
about mutants in '73...

444
00:41:03,736 --> 00:41:06,382
there have been cults
who see them as some kind of...

445
00:41:06,407 --> 00:41:08,919
Second Coming or sign of God.

446
00:41:08,944 --> 00:41:11,347
I was tracking one of them.

447
00:41:11,352 --> 00:41:14,408
They call themselves,
Ashir En Sabah Nur...

448
00:41:14,433 --> 00:41:18,081
named after an ancient being
they believe to be the world's first.

449
00:41:18,106 --> 00:41:19,565
The world's first what?

450
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,504
The world's first mutant.

451
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:23,756
I thought mutants didn't evolve
until this century.

452
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:26,401
That's the common theory, yes,
but these guys believe...

453
00:41:26,426 --> 00:41:29,928
that the first mutant was born
tens of thousands of years ago.

454
00:41:29,953 --> 00:41:32,201
And they believe he will rise again.

455
00:41:32,226 --> 00:41:36,352
They've been searching ancient sites
all around the world for clues.

456
00:41:36,377 --> 00:41:41,600
These hieroglyphs... describe a specific set
of powers greater than any man could possess.

457
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:43,509
They think he lived
all that time?

458
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:45,763
Yes and no.
They believe he had the ability...

459
00:41:45,788 --> 00:41:48,250
to transfer his consciousness
from body to body.

460
00:41:48,275 --> 00:41:49,723
And whenever he was
close to death...

461
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:51,547
he would just take
on a new body.

462
00:41:51,572 --> 00:41:53,477
Some of these may have been
the bodies of mutants...

463
00:41:53,478 --> 00:41:55,052
enabling him to take their powers...

464
00:41:55,077 --> 00:41:57,519
amassing various abilities
over the years.

465
00:41:57,544 --> 00:42:00,380
- An all-powerful mutant.
- Exactly.

466
00:42:00,405 --> 00:42:03,266
And wherever this being was
he always had four...

467
00:42:03,291 --> 00:42:05,932
principle followers.
Disciples.

468
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:08,202
Protectors he would imbue with powers.

469
00:42:08,227 --> 00:42:11,912
Like the Four Horsemen...
of the Apocalypse.

470
00:42:11,913 --> 00:42:13,169
He got that one
from the Bible.

471
00:42:13,194 --> 00:42:15,612
Or the Bible got it from him.

472
00:42:15,637 --> 00:42:17,618
And wherever he ruled...

473
00:42:17,643 --> 00:42:20,897
eventually, it would end in disaster.

474
00:42:20,922 --> 00:42:22,381
Cataclysm.

475
00:42:22,382 --> 00:42:24,591
Some kind of...

476
00:42:24,592 --> 00:42:26,760
Apocalypse.

477
00:42:27,095 --> 00:42:29,547
The end of the world.

478
00:42:30,415 --> 00:42:32,992
I must say, Apollo...

479
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:36,053
the way you ape human behavior
is remarkable.

480
00:42:36,078 --> 00:42:37,616
Get out, children.

481
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:39,012
Get out.
Get out.

482
00:42:39,037 --> 00:42:41,898
Come on.
Come on.

483
00:42:42,443 --> 00:42:43,569
I am Apollo.

484
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:46,864
I've never seen another
mutant in this town.

485
00:42:46,865 --> 00:42:48,490
You speak Egyptian?

486
00:42:48,491 --> 00:42:49,908
Arabic?

487
00:42:49,951 --> 00:42:51,243
English?

488
00:42:51,244 --> 00:42:52,953
I'm a scientist.

489
00:42:52,954 --> 00:42:54,734
My particular specialty...

490
00:42:54,759 --> 00:42:56,460
Great fighter.

491
00:42:57,642 --> 00:42:58,976
She's my hero.

492
00:42:59,001 --> 00:43:01,578
I want to be like her.

493
00:43:03,298 --> 00:43:06,161
There's some food here.
Not much.

494
00:43:06,186 --> 00:43:07,530
I don't believe it.

495
00:43:07,555 --> 00:43:09,459
You love me.

496
00:43:09,751 --> 00:43:11,452
Love you?

497
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:13,297
Illogical.

498
00:43:13,322 --> 00:43:17,108
I'm not some simple
shepherdess you can awe.

499
00:43:17,799 --> 00:43:19,435
Why, I could no more love you...

500
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:24,006
than I could love a new species
of bacteria.

501
00:43:24,611 --> 00:43:26,779
What are you doing?

502
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:30,783
Learning.

503
00:43:37,795 --> 00:43:41,895
In the streets, there is outrage against
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan...

504
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,086
...in a brotherhood of our kind.

505
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:44,709
Several demonstrations.

506
00:43:45,449 --> 00:43:48,641
One of them was held in Boston,
and Bruce Morton has the story.

507
00:43:48,666 --> 00:43:53,239
Since the advent of nuclear weapons,
the United States does not start fights.

508
00:43:53,264 --> 00:43:54,494
Weapons.

509
00:43:54,519 --> 00:43:57,438
Never before has man
possessed so much power.

510
00:43:57,463 --> 00:44:00,586
Soviet Union and United States
being superpowers...

511
00:44:01,773 --> 00:44:05,317
Superpowers.

512
00:44:05,616 --> 00:44:07,242
The weak...

513
00:44:07,267 --> 00:44:10,102
have taken the earth.

514
00:44:10,198 --> 00:44:13,655
For this, I was betrayed.

515
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,564
False gods.

516
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,520
Idols.

517
00:44:19,769 --> 00:44:22,470
No more.

518
00:44:25,213 --> 00:44:29,918
I have returned.

519
00:44:29,926 --> 00:44:32,177
A new tomorrow...

520
00:44:32,178 --> 00:44:34,574
that starts today.

521
00:44:38,663 --> 00:44:41,081
Where did you come from?

522
00:44:47,169 --> 00:44:51,123
A time before man lost his way.

523
00:44:51,812 --> 00:44:53,156
Well.

524
00:44:53,658 --> 00:44:55,784
Welcome to the '80s.

525
00:44:55,785 --> 00:44:59,284
This world needs to be...

526
00:45:00,193 --> 00:45:02,645
Cleansed.

527
00:45:02,792 --> 00:45:04,459
What?

528
00:45:04,711 --> 00:45:06,913
Saved.

529
00:45:08,211 --> 00:45:10,400
You can't save the world...

530
00:45:10,425 --> 00:45:12,551
just going around killing people.

531
00:45:12,552 --> 00:45:14,386
There's laws, systems in place

532
00:45:14,387 --> 00:45:16,283
for that kind of thing.

533
00:45:18,433 --> 00:45:19,808
My child...

534
00:45:19,809 --> 00:45:23,137
why do you enslave yourself?

535
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,191
What are you doing?

536
00:45:28,216 --> 00:45:31,312
Making you stronger.

537
00:45:31,714 --> 00:45:34,337
My goddess.

538
00:45:40,775 --> 00:45:42,522
Aphrodite.

539
00:45:42,847 --> 00:45:44,034
You were right.

540
00:45:44,059 --> 00:45:46,355
Yes.

541
00:45:49,088 --> 00:45:51,214
You were right.

542
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:53,792
The time is past.

543
00:45:53,968 --> 00:45:56,680
There is no room for gods.

544
00:46:00,683 --> 00:46:02,060
Why can't I go with you?

545
00:46:02,085 --> 00:46:04,412
I told you, I work alone.

546
00:46:10,974 --> 00:46:12,971
Wait there.

547
00:46:13,681 --> 00:46:15,989
Always good to see your face.

548
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:17,839
Even if it's not yours.

549
00:46:17,864 --> 00:46:20,061
Papers and passage for one.

550
00:46:21,788 --> 00:46:24,289
Where's the gentleman going,
if I may ask?

551
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:26,194
Don't know, don't care.

552
00:46:26,219 --> 00:46:28,728
I just save his life.
What he does with it is up to him.

553
00:46:28,753 --> 00:46:31,058
Mystique, the mercenary.

554
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:32,121
Don't call me that.

555
00:46:32,146 --> 00:46:34,058
No matter how much you pretend
to be someone else...

556
00:46:34,068 --> 00:46:35,693
Caliban knows who you are.

557
00:46:35,718 --> 00:46:38,204
If there's anything worth knowing
about mutants...

558
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:40,305
Caliban knows it.

559
00:46:40,306 --> 00:46:42,053
Mystique.

560
00:46:42,058 --> 00:46:43,225
Why don't you ask your psychics...

561
00:46:43,226 --> 00:46:45,352
what'll happen to you
if you keep pushing me?

562
00:46:45,353 --> 00:46:47,145
What'll happen?

563
00:46:50,508 --> 00:46:53,006
Psylocke gets a little jealous.

564
00:46:54,302 --> 00:46:56,029
But Caliban likes you.

565
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:57,447
Caliban likes money.

566
00:46:57,448 --> 00:46:59,491
Caliban likes you so much...

567
00:46:59,492 --> 00:47:01,631
he wants to give you free information...

568
00:47:01,656 --> 00:47:03,915
about an old friend...

569
00:47:03,955 --> 00:47:05,956
from back when you had friends.

570
00:47:05,957 --> 00:47:08,583
Do you remember...

571
00:47:08,584 --> 00:47:10,919
Erik Lehnsherr?

572
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,895
My girls got a flash
of him in Poland.

573
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,213
He left quite a few dead bodies
in his wake...

574
00:47:15,238 --> 00:47:18,359
including his wife
and daughter.

575
00:47:18,384 --> 00:47:20,416
Should be in the news
soon enough...

576
00:47:20,441 --> 00:47:24,145
but Caliban gives you
a little head start.

577
00:47:25,268 --> 00:47:27,277
- How fast are you?
- How fast?

578
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:28,661
How far can you cover?

579
00:47:28,686 --> 00:47:31,197
As far as I can see
or if I've been there before.

580
00:47:31,222 --> 00:47:33,697
- Come with me, Crawler.
- Actually, it's Nightcrawler.

581
00:47:33,722 --> 00:47:36,503
And my real name is...

582
00:47:37,363 --> 00:47:39,411
Kurt Wagner.

583
00:47:43,209 --> 00:47:45,806
The lenses are made of
some ruby quartz I had lying around.

584
00:47:45,831 --> 00:47:47,536
They should be able to
refract your optic beams...

585
00:47:47,546 --> 00:47:50,184
and keep them contained
within their own vector fields.

586
00:47:50,209 --> 00:47:51,909
Try them on.

587
00:48:06,058 --> 00:48:06,933
Okay.

588
00:48:06,934 --> 00:48:08,722
Go ahead.

589
00:48:09,272 --> 00:48:11,938
Wait.
Wait, sorry, no.

590
00:48:11,939 --> 00:48:12,981
Okay.

591
00:48:12,982 --> 00:48:14,065
- Now?
- Yeah, you're good.

592
00:48:14,066 --> 00:48:15,550
All right.

593
00:48:19,014 --> 00:48:20,715
Whoa.

594
00:48:21,616 --> 00:48:23,325
I can see.

595
00:48:23,326 --> 00:48:24,823
Thank you.

596
00:48:24,848 --> 00:48:26,712
Professor, thank you.
You're a genius.

597
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,154
No.

598
00:48:28,179 --> 00:48:31,302
I'm not a professor.
I wish...

599
00:48:32,939 --> 00:48:34,640
Who's that?

600
00:48:36,464 --> 00:48:38,073
I believe you two met.
That's Jean Grey.

601
00:48:38,098 --> 00:48:39,692
You bumped into her
when you arrived.

602
00:48:39,717 --> 00:48:42,340
- Wait, that's her?
- Yeah.

603
00:48:47,206 --> 00:48:48,748
Hey.

604
00:48:50,937 --> 00:48:52,763
You can see.

605
00:48:53,168 --> 00:48:55,734
Yeah.
It's not as bad as I thought here.

606
00:48:55,759 --> 00:48:56,884
Freak.

607
00:48:56,909 --> 00:48:58,425
- Someone should warn the new kid.
- Yeah. Someone should tell him.

608
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,235
They're still scared of me.

609
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:02,322
Hey, I have special glasses now.

610
00:49:02,323 --> 00:49:05,300
They're not scared of you.
They're scared of me.

611
00:49:05,935 --> 00:49:09,980
You're not the only one who
can't fully control your powers.

612
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:11,581
Wait, so...

613
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:14,669
last night, when the house shook...

614
00:49:14,694 --> 00:49:15,835
that was you?

615
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:19,162
Sorry to break it to you, but you're not
the biggest freak in the school.

616
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:22,146
Well, that's a first.

617
00:49:35,189 --> 00:49:36,978
Raven.

618
00:49:41,112 --> 00:49:42,813
Wow.

619
00:49:43,192 --> 00:49:45,080
I...
You're...

620
00:49:45,105 --> 00:49:46,512
Not blue?

621
00:49:46,537 --> 00:49:48,659
Looks like you and I
have that in common, now.

622
00:49:48,684 --> 00:49:51,478
No, no, I meant...
you...

623
00:49:52,688 --> 00:49:54,605
you're back.

624
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:57,767
Never thought I'd see you here again.

625
00:49:58,779 --> 00:50:00,901
Yeah, me neither.

626
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:05,368
I'm blue.

627
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:06,703
I'm Kurt.

628
00:50:06,704 --> 00:50:08,288
Oh, right.

629
00:50:08,289 --> 00:50:10,064
Kurt Wagner.

630
00:50:10,376 --> 00:50:11,918
Welcome.

631
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:16,778
We're closed.

632
00:50:19,592 --> 00:50:22,294
I knew I felt
a chill in the air.

633
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:25,703
How did you get in here?

634
00:50:25,728 --> 00:50:26,973
We let ourselves in.

635
00:50:26,974 --> 00:50:28,642
We are looking for mutants.

636
00:50:28,643 --> 00:50:31,895
Since you know where to find them,
we came here.

637
00:50:31,896 --> 00:50:34,037
Caliban doesn't know you.

638
00:50:34,607 --> 00:50:38,219
We're looking for the strongest.

639
00:50:41,522 --> 00:50:42,814
Everything all right?

640
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:44,926
I'm fine, Psylocke.

641
00:50:44,951 --> 00:50:47,261
How much money do you have?

642
00:50:47,286 --> 00:50:48,828
None.

643
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:51,393
Like Caliban said...

644
00:50:51,418 --> 00:50:53,791
we are closed.
Yeah?

645
00:50:54,621 --> 00:50:57,699
I need your help, my child.

646
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:00,503
You don't look like
Caliban's father.

647
00:51:00,508 --> 00:51:03,079
Maybe a little bit up here.

648
00:51:10,073 --> 00:51:12,310
You are all my children...

649
00:51:12,311 --> 00:51:16,356
and you're lost, because
you follow blind leaders.

650
00:51:16,381 --> 00:51:19,192
These false gods...

651
00:51:19,193 --> 00:51:22,153
systems of the weak.

652
00:51:22,154 --> 00:51:24,965
They've ruined my world...

653
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:26,854
No more.

654
00:51:34,604 --> 00:51:37,147
What do you want?

655
00:51:46,157 --> 00:51:48,376
I want you...

656
00:51:48,401 --> 00:51:52,962
to feel the full reach
of your power.

657
00:51:57,017 --> 00:52:00,311
You've only had a taste
of your true strength.

658
00:52:00,336 --> 00:52:01,877
Unlike others...

659
00:52:01,902 --> 00:52:04,738
who seek to control you...

660
00:52:04,739 --> 00:52:07,783
I want to set you free.

661
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:19,920
I know the kind of mutants
you're looking for.

662
00:52:21,422 --> 00:52:23,954
And I know where to find them.

663
00:52:27,338 --> 00:52:29,006
It's my first time in America.

664
00:52:29,031 --> 00:52:31,120
I'm very excited
to see your culture.

665
00:52:31,145 --> 00:52:33,034
Well, you're not gonna
see it here.

666
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:36,394
The only thing American about this place
is that it used to be British.

667
00:52:36,395 --> 00:52:38,164
This is Scott.

668
00:52:38,189 --> 00:52:39,964
He's new here, too.

669
00:52:39,989 --> 00:52:42,511
And I'm already up
for a prison break.

670
00:52:43,944 --> 00:52:46,529
What do we say, we take this blue guy
on a little field trip?

671
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,948
I'm sure there's a
mall around here, somewhere.

672
00:52:48,949 --> 00:52:50,821
What's a mall?

673
00:52:51,285 --> 00:52:52,452
What's a mall?

674
00:52:52,453 --> 00:52:55,455
All right, now this is a matter of
national pride. Civic duty.

675
00:52:55,456 --> 00:52:57,011
Scott.

676
00:52:57,036 --> 00:52:59,935
What? You've been cooped up here
for a long time...

677
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,707
and the Professor's not even home.

678
00:53:02,732 --> 00:53:05,340
I'd like to go to the mall.

679
00:53:06,757 --> 00:53:07,943
Try it.

680
00:53:07,968 --> 00:53:09,396
All right.

681
00:53:09,421 --> 00:53:11,404
Where does he keep his cars?

682
00:53:24,273 --> 00:53:26,087
Verpiss Dich!

683
00:53:26,112 --> 00:53:28,723
Or should I say "piss off"?

684
00:53:33,494 --> 00:53:34,911
This is the guy?

685
00:53:34,912 --> 00:53:36,496
He used to be.

686
00:53:36,497 --> 00:53:38,846
I didn't know his wings were...

687
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:44,129
Let's get out of here.

688
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:46,279
His fighting days are done.

689
00:53:46,304 --> 00:53:48,446
No, they're not.

690
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:55,830
What the hell is this?

691
00:53:58,010 --> 00:54:00,019
I want to give you something.

692
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:03,128
There's nothing you can give me
that I want.

693
00:54:03,153 --> 00:54:05,567
Yes, there is.

694
00:54:19,999 --> 00:54:22,889
Yes, my son.

695
00:54:35,891 --> 00:54:38,339
Yes.

696
00:54:48,736 --> 00:54:52,440
Rise, my angel.

697
00:54:54,575 --> 00:54:56,702
Rise.

698
00:55:26,085 --> 00:55:27,845
Wow.

699
00:55:28,947 --> 00:55:32,375
Hypersonic, blast resistant,
stealth technology.

700
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,290
That's impressive.

701
00:55:34,315 --> 00:55:37,359
How are you ever gonna
get it out of here?

702
00:55:38,003 --> 00:55:39,170
Well, that's okay.

703
00:55:39,195 --> 00:55:41,935
I built a retractable roof
into the basketball court.

704
00:55:42,915 --> 00:55:45,709
Hank, you're building
a warplane down here.

705
00:55:45,734 --> 00:55:48,501
After what happened in Washington,
I thought we were going to come back...

706
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,898
and start the X-Men,
like we all used to talk about.

707
00:55:50,923 --> 00:55:52,340
But...

708
00:55:52,341 --> 00:55:54,801
Charles wants students, not soldiers.

709
00:55:54,802 --> 00:55:56,405
And he thinks the best of people.

710
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:57,824
He has hope.

711
00:55:57,849 --> 00:55:59,561
And you?

712
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:02,600
You know, I think we should
hope for the best.

713
00:56:02,601 --> 00:56:05,612
And prepare for the worst.

714
00:56:05,637 --> 00:56:07,884
I think the world
needs the X-Men.

715
00:56:08,691 --> 00:56:12,443
And maybe now that you're back,
you could help me convince him.

716
00:56:12,444 --> 00:56:15,407
- We could start it together.
- Hank, I'm here about Erik.

717
00:56:16,224 --> 00:56:18,017
Right. Erik.

718
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:19,994
Yeah. Of course.

719
00:56:20,019 --> 00:56:21,019
Of course.

720
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,326
I think he might be
in some kind of trouble.

721
00:56:23,372 --> 00:56:25,369
Real trouble.

722
00:56:26,231 --> 00:56:28,399
Isn't he always?

723
00:57:02,332 --> 00:57:04,537
Some of you spoke to the police...

724
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:08,830
about what you believe
you witnessed here yesterday.

725
00:57:10,734 --> 00:57:13,107
You want to know my powers...

726
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:16,301
know who I am...

727
00:57:17,446 --> 00:57:19,817
see what I can do?

728
00:57:21,597 --> 00:57:23,579
I'll show you.

729
00:57:25,564 --> 00:57:29,234
Think of the person you love most
in your life.

730
00:57:30,941 --> 00:57:32,893
Your wife.

731
00:57:35,157 --> 00:57:37,109
Mother.

732
00:57:39,494 --> 00:57:41,662
Daughter.

733
00:57:45,433 --> 00:57:49,703
Now that person will know what it is
to lose someone they love.

734
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,600
And live with that pain.

735
00:57:53,888 --> 00:57:54,971
Forever.

736
00:57:54,996 --> 00:57:56,794
Henryk, please.

737
00:57:56,819 --> 00:57:58,745
Don't do this.

738
00:57:59,218 --> 00:58:01,636
My name isn't Henryk.

739
00:58:05,015 --> 00:58:07,502
My name is Magneto.

740
00:58:28,122 --> 00:58:30,242
Who the fuck are you?

741
00:58:32,519 --> 00:58:34,857
Stay back.

742
00:58:36,189 --> 00:58:38,151
Whoever you are...

743
00:58:38,176 --> 00:58:41,711
don't try to stop me
from killing these men.

744
00:58:59,737 --> 00:59:02,189
I'm not here for them.

745
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:05,737
I'm here for you.

746
00:59:22,301 --> 00:59:24,537
Come and see.

747
00:59:57,252 --> 01:00:00,580
This is where your power was born.

748
01:00:02,424 --> 01:00:05,547
And this is where
your people were slaughtered.

749
01:00:20,442 --> 01:00:23,270
You shouldn't have brought me here.

750
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:26,814
Why?

751
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:31,125
Are you afraid to be here?

752
01:00:32,204 --> 01:00:35,703
You can't escape it, Erik.

753
01:00:37,125 --> 01:00:38,824
Who are you?

754
01:00:38,849 --> 01:00:42,272
Elohim, Shen, Ra.

755
01:00:42,297 --> 01:00:46,877
I've been called many names
over many lifetimes.

756
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:50,221
I am born of death.

757
01:00:50,222 --> 01:00:54,871
I was there to spark... and fan
the flame of man's awakening.

758
01:00:54,896 --> 01:00:57,481
To spin the wheel of civilization.

759
01:00:57,506 --> 01:00:59,256
And when the forest would grow rank...

760
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:02,154
and needed clearing for new growth...

761
01:01:02,393 --> 01:01:06,636
I was there to set it ablaze.

762
01:01:07,281 --> 01:01:08,948
Where were you...

763
01:01:08,949 --> 01:01:11,748
when my father and mother
were slaughtered in this place?

764
01:01:11,773 --> 01:01:13,160
Asleep.

765
01:01:13,161 --> 01:01:15,788
Trapped in darkness.

766
01:01:15,813 --> 01:01:17,939
I was not there for you, my son.

767
01:01:17,964 --> 01:01:20,409
But I am here now.

768
01:01:20,434 --> 01:01:24,246
You don't know your own strength,
but I do.

769
01:01:27,134 --> 01:01:29,758
Reach down.

770
01:01:29,783 --> 01:01:33,244
Feel the metal...
in the ground.

771
01:01:33,269 --> 01:01:36,727
Reach as deep as you can.

772
01:01:38,979 --> 01:01:41,397
You'll find you have the power...

773
01:01:41,398 --> 01:01:44,977
to move the very Earth itself.

774
01:02:17,207 --> 01:02:23,000
Everything they've built will fall!

775
01:02:23,414 --> 01:02:26,788
And from the ashes of their world...

776
01:02:27,512 --> 01:02:31,130
we'll build a better one!

777
01:02:57,683 --> 01:03:02,103
Lehnsherr was identified yesterday,
in this small town in central Poland.

778
01:03:02,104 --> 01:03:06,190
Leaders from all communities are urging
their citizens to remain calm.

779
01:03:06,191 --> 01:03:09,610
As police and armed forces
are mobilizing to find Lehnsherr...

780
01:03:09,611 --> 01:03:11,112
...before he can strike again.

781
01:03:11,113 --> 01:03:14,100
If anyone has information
about Lehnsherr...

782
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:16,389
or as he is also known, Magneto...

783
01:03:16,414 --> 01:03:19,137
contact your local authorities
immediately...

784
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:21,247
and proceed with caution...

785
01:03:21,248 --> 01:03:24,511
- as he is considered extremely...
- Peter.

786
01:03:24,536 --> 01:03:26,127
What's up?

787
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:30,172
Just checking on you.

788
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:32,466
I'm good.
Playing Pac-Man.

789
01:03:37,806 --> 01:03:39,265
You sure you weren't watching this?

790
01:03:39,266 --> 01:03:41,308
This news comes at a time when the world
is celebrating 10 years of peace...

791
01:03:41,309 --> 01:03:43,561
between mutants and mankind.

792
01:03:43,562 --> 01:03:46,014
You're going after him, aren't you?

793
01:03:47,024 --> 01:03:49,818
You wanted me to get
out of the house more, right?

794
01:03:49,943 --> 01:03:52,937
I can't stop you.
Nobody can.

795
01:03:52,962 --> 01:03:55,664
But trust me, this won't end well.

796
01:03:56,021 --> 01:03:58,314
Nothing does with him.

797
01:04:01,413 --> 01:04:03,164
I'm not afraid of him.

798
01:04:03,165 --> 01:04:05,343
You should be.

799
01:04:31,026 --> 01:04:33,820
I've read so much about this place.

800
01:04:34,529 --> 01:04:37,490
But being here,
it actually seems kind of...

801
01:04:37,736 --> 01:04:39,241
familiar.

802
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:40,409
Strange.

803
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:41,702
Quite.

804
01:04:41,703 --> 01:04:43,567
Shall we?

805
01:04:44,535 --> 01:04:46,707
I'm just saying,
Empire is still the best.

806
01:04:46,708 --> 01:04:49,418
It's the most complex,
the most sophisticated...

807
01:04:49,419 --> 01:04:50,920
wasn't afraid to have a dark ending.

808
01:04:50,921 --> 01:04:52,588
Yeah, but come on.
If it wasn't for the first one...

809
01:04:52,589 --> 01:04:54,256
you wouldn't have any of
the rest of the movies.

810
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:57,983
Well, at least we can all agree,
the third one's always the worst.

811
01:04:58,553 --> 01:05:00,346
Hank.
Are you in here?

812
01:05:00,347 --> 01:05:02,640
I'd like you to meet...

813
01:05:03,975 --> 01:05:05,267
Moira.

814
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:06,977
Raven.

815
01:05:06,978 --> 01:05:09,203
I'm sorry, have we met?

816
01:05:10,565 --> 01:05:13,228
Hank, Alex, Agent MacTaggert...

817
01:05:13,253 --> 01:05:15,548
would you give us just one moment,
please?

818
01:05:16,113 --> 01:05:17,803
Of course.

819
01:05:20,992 --> 01:05:23,619
Charles, why didn't she recognize me?
She knew me in this form.

820
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:26,597
Well, after you
left me on the beach in Cuba...

821
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:29,996
I took her memories of that time.
Have a seat.

822
01:05:30,021 --> 01:05:32,165
Lucky girl.

823
01:05:34,368 --> 01:05:36,768
It's good to see you, Raven.

824
01:05:36,793 --> 01:05:39,621
- Welcome home.
- This isn't my home.

825
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:41,340
It was once.

826
01:05:41,365 --> 01:05:44,181
No, it was your home.
I just lived here.

827
01:05:44,182 --> 01:05:46,142
And I barely even recognize it now.

828
01:05:46,143 --> 01:05:48,641
You know, I have plans for this place.

829
01:05:49,187 --> 01:05:51,063
I mean to turn it
into a real campus.

830
01:05:51,064 --> 01:05:52,314
A university.

831
01:05:52,339 --> 01:05:56,044
Not just for mutants, either,
for humans too.

832
01:05:56,069 --> 01:05:58,304
Living and working...

833
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:00,748
growing together.

834
01:06:00,866 --> 01:06:02,877
You know, I really believed that once.

835
01:06:02,902 --> 01:06:06,054
I really believed we could
change them after DC.

836
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:07,246
We did.

837
01:06:07,247 --> 01:06:09,373
No, Charles.
They still hate and fear us.

838
01:06:09,374 --> 01:06:11,792
It's just harder to see
because they're more polite about it.

839
01:06:11,793 --> 01:06:13,210
I got sick of living that lie.

840
01:06:13,211 --> 01:06:16,422
That's why you're not in your
natural blue form.

841
01:06:16,423 --> 01:06:19,971
I'm not gonna be the face of a world
that doesn't exist.

842
01:06:20,218 --> 01:06:22,521
Things are better.
The world is better.

843
01:06:22,546 --> 01:06:24,793
Maybe in Westchester.

844
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:27,467
Out there, mutants are still running...

845
01:06:27,475 --> 01:06:29,336
hiding, living in fear.

846
01:06:29,361 --> 01:06:32,726
Just because there's not a war,
doesn't mean there's peace.

847
01:06:32,731 --> 01:06:34,565
You want to teach your kids something,
teach them that.

848
01:06:34,566 --> 01:06:35,965
Teach them to fight.

849
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:38,190
Otherwise they might as well live
in this house for the rest of their lives.

850
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,465
You still sound just like him.

851
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:43,002
You sound just like Erik.

852
01:06:44,659 --> 01:06:46,827
That's why I'm here.

853
01:06:46,953 --> 01:06:49,121
He's resurfaced.

854
01:06:50,916 --> 01:06:53,042
He had a wife and a child.

855
01:06:53,043 --> 01:06:54,960
They were killed.

856
01:06:55,045 --> 01:06:57,793
Along with a handful of policemen.

857
01:06:59,674 --> 01:07:02,106
The whole world will be
looking for him.

858
01:07:02,131 --> 01:07:05,166
But you can help me find him
before they do.

859
01:07:13,623 --> 01:07:16,666
Moira, I'm going to have to ask you
to keep this a secret.

860
01:07:16,691 --> 01:07:19,602
I don't even know
what this is.

861
01:07:19,627 --> 01:07:21,504
It's Cerebro.

862
01:07:21,529 --> 01:07:22,696
The new model.

863
01:07:22,697 --> 01:07:25,145
I based the color on...

864
01:07:26,995 --> 01:07:28,696
It doesn't matter.

865
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:47,304
What are those?

866
01:07:47,305 --> 01:07:50,178
Those are all the humans
of the world.

867
01:07:51,775 --> 01:07:54,061
And these...

868
01:07:54,062 --> 01:07:56,355
are all the mutants.

869
01:07:56,356 --> 01:07:59,381
I'm connected to
all of their minds.

870
01:07:59,901 --> 01:08:01,986
The CIA would kill for this.

871
01:08:01,987 --> 01:08:04,314
I know they would.

872
01:08:06,241 --> 01:08:08,470
Where are you, Erik?

873
01:08:40,279 --> 01:08:41,980
Charles?

874
01:08:42,861 --> 01:08:44,751
Hello, old friend.

875
01:08:47,221 --> 01:08:49,300
I'm sorry.
I am so sorry!

876
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:51,698
I feel your pain.

877
01:08:52,454 --> 01:08:54,747
And your loss.

878
01:08:55,415 --> 01:08:58,743
You think because you can
see into my head...

879
01:08:58,793 --> 01:09:01,495
you know how it feels?

880
01:09:01,629 --> 01:09:04,214
You're looking in the wrong place,
Charles.

881
01:09:04,215 --> 01:09:07,464
What happened to them,
it was terribly wrong.

882
01:09:08,678 --> 01:09:10,095
But come back to us.

883
01:09:10,096 --> 01:09:12,343
I can help you.

884
01:09:12,474 --> 01:09:14,693
Help me?

885
01:09:15,126 --> 01:09:16,813
Think of your wife,
think of your daughter.

886
01:09:16,855 --> 01:09:20,259
- What would they have wanted?
- They would have wanted to live.

887
01:09:21,028 --> 01:09:23,947
I tried your way, Charles.

888
01:09:24,194 --> 01:09:26,979
I tried to be like them.

889
01:09:27,655 --> 01:09:30,093
Live like them.

890
01:09:31,785 --> 01:09:34,829
But it always ends
the same way.

891
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:39,162
They took everything away from me.

892
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:44,151
Now...

893
01:09:47,255 --> 01:09:50,664
we'll take everything from them.

894
01:09:57,984 --> 01:09:59,685
Hank...

895
01:10:01,398 --> 01:10:03,620
he's not alone.

896
01:10:10,657 --> 01:10:12,779
Extraordinary.

897
01:10:13,743 --> 01:10:15,875
What do you see?

898
01:10:18,039 --> 01:10:20,588
The answer.

899
01:10:22,335 --> 01:10:24,332
Hey, Charles, wait.

900
01:10:37,016 --> 01:10:39,051
Oh, my God.

901
01:10:39,076 --> 01:10:42,380
Thank you for letting me in.

902
01:10:46,984 --> 01:10:48,821
Charles.
Charles, get out!

903
01:10:48,846 --> 01:10:50,203
Charles.

904
01:10:50,655 --> 01:10:53,991
I've never felt power
like this before.

905
01:10:53,992 --> 01:10:56,285
Charles...
Charles, get out of there.

906
01:10:56,286 --> 01:10:58,036
What's going on?
What's happening?

907
01:10:58,037 --> 01:10:59,660
I think...

908
01:10:59,685 --> 01:11:01,182
Someone's taken over Cerebro.

909
01:11:01,207 --> 01:11:03,830
- They've taken control of it.
- To do what?

910
01:11:05,055 --> 01:11:07,007
To connect.

911
01:11:15,513 --> 01:11:18,188
Always the same.

912
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:22,043
And now, all this.

913
01:11:25,064 --> 01:11:28,620
No more stones.

914
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:33,442
No more spears.

915
01:11:39,662 --> 01:11:43,591
No more slings.

916
01:11:46,544 --> 01:11:49,755
No more swords.

917
01:11:49,756 --> 01:11:53,217
No more weapons!

918
01:11:53,218 --> 01:11:56,967
No more systems!

919
01:11:57,096 --> 01:12:00,016
No more!

920
01:12:00,266 --> 01:12:03,966
No more superpowers.

921
01:12:04,552 --> 01:12:06,309
Charles!

922
01:12:08,951 --> 01:12:10,582
Hank!

923
01:12:27,936 --> 01:12:30,104
What the hell is going on?

924
01:12:30,129 --> 01:12:32,555
Who's turning the keys?

925
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:34,182
The men are.

926
01:12:34,207 --> 01:12:35,800
Who green-lit the launch?

927
01:12:35,825 --> 01:12:37,870
Hank, do something!

928
01:12:42,475 --> 01:12:44,427
It won't shut down!

929
01:12:46,604 --> 01:12:49,481
We've lost contact
with all Trident and Polaris subs.

930
01:12:49,482 --> 01:12:51,445
The Air Force is reporting
the same thing.

931
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:54,931
So much faith in their tools...

932
01:12:54,956 --> 01:12:57,882
and their machines.

933
01:12:57,907 --> 01:13:02,286
Russia, China...
England, Israel, India.

934
01:13:02,287 --> 01:13:04,329
Everybody's got nukes in the air.

935
01:13:04,330 --> 01:13:06,748
What's the target?
Where are they going?

936
01:13:06,749 --> 01:13:08,792
Up, straight up.

937
01:13:08,793 --> 01:13:09,668
Alex...

938
01:13:09,669 --> 01:13:11,275
- What?
- Destroy it!

939
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:14,412
Destroy everything.
Destroy Cerebro!

940
01:13:18,008 --> 01:13:19,972
Wreak havoc!

941
01:13:23,933 --> 01:13:26,108
You can fire your arrows...

942
01:13:26,133 --> 01:13:29,005
from the Tower of Babel...

943
01:13:37,696 --> 01:13:43,548
but you can never strike God!

944
01:13:59,886 --> 01:14:02,574
Charles.
Charles, are you okay?

945
01:14:19,947 --> 01:14:21,819
Erik.

946
01:14:24,402 --> 01:14:26,103
Charles!

947
01:14:27,038 --> 01:14:28,673
Alex!

948
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:30,832
Hey!
Hey, asshole!

949
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:33,314
All will be revealed, my child.

950
01:14:33,339 --> 01:14:34,621
Stop!

951
01:14:34,646 --> 01:14:36,142
No!

952
01:17:31,906 --> 01:17:33,607
Wow!

953
01:17:37,937 --> 01:17:39,604
Where did you...

954
01:17:39,605 --> 01:17:42,491
I was looking for the Professor.
I thought he lived here.

955
01:17:45,798 --> 01:17:47,545
They took him.

956
01:17:48,114 --> 01:17:50,532
She's the one.
It's her.

957
01:17:50,825 --> 01:17:52,651
Are you sure?

958
01:17:52,676 --> 01:17:54,554
Is she gonna help us?

959
01:18:03,655 --> 01:18:05,542
They look up to you.

960
01:18:09,627 --> 01:18:11,249
Right now...

961
01:18:11,274 --> 01:18:13,066
they need you.

962
01:18:16,142 --> 01:18:18,318
That's not what they need.

963
01:18:19,979 --> 01:18:21,931
That's awesome!

964
01:18:29,652 --> 01:18:30,819
What happened?

965
01:18:30,844 --> 01:18:32,334
Where's Alex?

966
01:18:32,359 --> 01:18:33,885
Where's my brother?

967
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:36,058
Pretty sure I got everybody.

968
01:18:38,122 --> 01:18:41,042
Alex was closest to the blast.

969
01:18:56,515 --> 01:18:58,216
Alex...

970
01:19:19,538 --> 01:19:21,575
We're one click out.

971
01:19:21,874 --> 01:19:24,167
All right, boys.
This is it.

972
01:19:25,935 --> 01:19:27,177
<font color="#ff80c0">Please remain calm.</font>

973
01:19:27,202 --> 01:19:28,369
Scott.

974
01:19:28,394 --> 01:19:32,251
Medical assistance is on the way.

975
01:19:32,551 --> 01:19:34,689
Please remain calm.

976
01:19:34,714 --> 01:19:38,509
Medical assistance is on the way.

977
01:19:38,683 --> 01:19:40,907
Please remain calm.

978
01:19:40,932 --> 01:19:44,806
Medical assistance is on the way.

979
01:19:45,418 --> 01:19:47,625
Please remain calm.

980
01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:50,956
Medical assistance is on the way.

981
01:19:52,694 --> 01:19:54,908
Hey!
Moira MacTaggert!

982
01:19:54,933 --> 01:19:57,785
CIA!
Thank God you're here!

983
01:20:02,922 --> 01:20:04,678
Wait!

984
01:20:04,703 --> 01:20:06,440
Fire!

985
01:20:11,404 --> 01:20:13,105
I want her.

986
01:20:14,958 --> 01:20:16,725
- Him!
- Yes, sir.

987
01:20:17,353 --> 01:20:19,404
- Him!
- Roger that.

988
01:20:25,607 --> 01:20:27,453
- And her.
- Yes, sir.

989
01:20:27,478 --> 01:20:29,366
Alright, you heard him.
Get them on board.

990
01:20:29,391 --> 01:20:31,201
What about this one?

991
01:20:31,904 --> 01:20:33,837
Leave the kids.

992
01:20:39,995 --> 01:20:42,489
- What do we do?
- Keep quiet.

993
01:20:43,189 --> 01:20:46,304
X-Ray 7, I'm doing a final sweep
of the ground.

994
01:20:53,716 --> 01:20:55,736
Let's get them on the bird!

995
01:20:55,761 --> 01:20:57,260
Clear!

996
01:20:58,601 --> 01:21:00,868
Pack them up.
Let's go.

997
01:21:01,431 --> 01:21:02,867
Let's move it!
Move!

998
01:21:02,892 --> 01:21:06,121
Thanks, Jean.
We gotta help them.

999
01:21:06,146 --> 01:21:08,772
- Kurt, can you get us in that thing?
- You want to get in there'?

1000
01:21:08,773 --> 01:21:10,065
What if the soldiers see us?

1001
01:21:10,066 --> 01:21:12,439
Don't worry, they won't see us.
Trust me.

1002
01:21:14,493 --> 01:21:16,035
Hold on.

1003
01:21:31,170 --> 01:21:33,650
Kurt, get us all out of here!

1004
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,341
I can't!

1005
01:21:36,342 --> 01:21:39,678
When they closed the doors,
there's some kind of electrical field.

1006
01:21:39,703 --> 01:21:41,182
It's like Berlin all over.

1007
01:21:41,207 --> 01:21:43,139
Jean, get in the pilots' heads.
Don't let them take off.

1008
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:46,898
I can't. I can't reach the pilots.
I can't reach anyone.

1009
01:21:53,859 --> 01:21:56,151
We're also getting reports
out of Europe and Asia.

1010
01:21:56,176 --> 01:21:58,510
This was not just a U.S. phenomenon.

1011
01:21:58,535 --> 01:22:02,266
It seems the entire world
has been disarmed of nuclear weapons.

1012
01:22:02,291 --> 01:22:04,512
The Pentagon has confirmed
multiple launches...

1013
01:22:04,537 --> 01:22:07,038
from Russia, as well as
the UK, Israel and China.

1014
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:08,306
- Look!
- Look up there!

1015
01:22:08,331 --> 01:22:10,364
So far, there has been no response
from the White House.

1016
01:22:10,374 --> 01:22:14,143
Eyewitness reports have been pouring in
from affiliates across the globe.

1017
01:22:14,168 --> 01:22:19,172
Authorities are not sure
if it was an act of peace or an act of war.

1018
01:22:25,015 --> 01:22:27,298
Our dear Father...

1019
01:22:27,893 --> 01:22:30,364
hold me in the light of God.

1020
01:22:34,311 --> 01:22:36,500
It should have been me.

1021
01:22:37,486 --> 01:22:40,905
He was the one that was
gonna do something with his life.

1022
01:22:40,906 --> 01:22:43,108
He was always the one.

1023
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:46,578
That's not how he felt.

1024
01:22:46,799 --> 01:22:51,125
He felt you were the one that was gonna
do something special with your life.

1025
01:22:51,584 --> 01:22:54,929
That you were gonna
make a difference in the world.

1026
01:22:55,838 --> 01:22:58,453
Maybe even change it.

1027
01:22:58,712 --> 01:23:01,000
How do you know
what he felt?

1028
01:23:01,844 --> 01:23:04,534
I know what everybody feels.

1029
01:23:19,612 --> 01:23:22,861
Hold me in the light of God.

1030
01:23:22,907 --> 01:23:26,110
Protect me from danger.

1031
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:29,159
Save me by your command.

1032
01:23:29,914 --> 01:23:32,491
Listen to my prayer.

1033
01:23:32,875 --> 01:23:35,418
And keep me safe.

1034
01:24:09,954 --> 01:24:12,257
You're blocking me.

1035
01:24:12,282 --> 01:24:13,296
How?

1036
01:24:13,321 --> 01:24:15,806
I can shield their minds
from your power.

1037
01:24:15,831 --> 01:24:19,647
It's one of the many gifts
I've acquired throughout the millennia.

1038
01:24:19,672 --> 01:24:22,465
But to see...

1039
01:24:22,466 --> 01:24:24,510
inside a mind...

1040
01:24:24,535 --> 01:24:26,979
to control it...

1041
01:24:27,638 --> 01:24:29,885
that's your gift.

1042
01:24:30,766 --> 01:24:32,767
You saw it, didn't you?

1043
01:24:32,792 --> 01:24:35,586
The glory of what's to come.

1044
01:24:36,146 --> 01:24:38,701
You're going to take part
in all this killing...

1045
01:24:39,459 --> 01:24:41,688
and destruction?

1046
01:24:41,944 --> 01:24:43,361
It's all I've ever known.

1047
01:24:43,362 --> 01:24:45,218
No, it isn't.

1048
01:24:45,243 --> 01:24:46,430
You've just forgotten.

1049
01:24:46,455 --> 01:24:49,078
No, Charles, I remember.

1050
01:24:50,851 --> 01:24:52,768
Your way doesn't work.

1051
01:24:52,793 --> 01:24:55,631
I've shown him a better way.

1052
01:24:55,656 --> 01:24:56,838
A better world.

1053
01:24:56,863 --> 01:25:00,674
No, you've just tapped into his rage
and pain. That's all you've done.

1054
01:25:00,963 --> 01:25:04,424
I told you from the moment I met you,
there is more to you, Erik.

1055
01:25:04,425 --> 01:25:07,218
There is good in you, too.

1056
01:25:07,219 --> 01:25:10,718
Whatever it is you think
you saw in me, Charles...

1057
01:25:12,349 --> 01:25:14,183
I buried it...

1058
01:25:14,184 --> 01:25:16,393
with my family.

1059
01:25:28,808 --> 01:25:30,116
- What?
- What?

1060
01:25:30,117 --> 01:25:31,659
What's wrong with you?

1061
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:34,099
Is that going to happen
to all of us?

1062
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:37,850
No, I just... left my
meds in the house.

1063
01:25:37,875 --> 01:25:39,357
What happened?
Where are we?

1064
01:25:39,382 --> 01:25:40,710
Hey!

1065
01:25:40,711 --> 01:25:41,961
Hello, Mystique.

1066
01:25:41,962 --> 01:25:43,463
Major Stryker.

1067
01:25:43,464 --> 01:25:44,606
Colonel Stryker.

1068
01:25:44,631 --> 01:25:46,538
I wouldn't get too close to the wall,
if I were you.

1069
01:25:46,548 --> 01:25:48,799
It may create some discomfort.

1070
01:25:48,824 --> 01:25:52,046
I'm Moira MacTaggert.
I'm a senior officer at the CIA.

1071
01:25:52,071 --> 01:25:53,918
I know who you are, Agent MacTaggert.

1072
01:25:53,943 --> 01:25:55,526
You cannot keep me here, in this...

1073
01:25:55,551 --> 01:25:57,369
Actually, I can.

1074
01:25:57,394 --> 01:26:01,481
A psychic event just destroyed
every nuke from here to Moscow.

1075
01:26:01,482 --> 01:26:04,796
That event emanated from exactly
where we found you.

1076
01:26:04,821 --> 01:26:07,595
At the home of the world's
most powerful psychic.

1077
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:11,901
So, you are going to tell me,
where is Charles Xavier?

1078
01:26:11,927 --> 01:26:14,374
It's not him
you should be worried about.

1079
01:26:14,399 --> 01:26:18,059
There's someone else.
Someone more powerful.

1080
01:26:18,084 --> 01:26:21,295
If you let us out of here,
we can help you.

1081
01:26:22,169 --> 01:26:25,038
Do you really expect me
to believe that?

1082
01:26:25,124 --> 01:26:28,108
You can put on any face that you want,
but I know who you are.

1083
01:26:28,133 --> 01:26:30,117
What you are.

1084
01:26:34,713 --> 01:26:36,817
Hey, Moira.

1085
01:26:36,842 --> 01:26:38,515
What did you mean when you said...

1086
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:41,363
someone more powerful than Charles?

1087
01:26:42,585 --> 01:26:44,958
Once they finish these,
we'll go from there.

1088
01:26:51,198 --> 01:26:52,782
What's taking so long?

1089
01:26:52,783 --> 01:26:54,075
I can't get in.

1090
01:26:54,076 --> 01:26:56,953
They have a field around it,
like the helicopter.

1091
01:26:56,954 --> 01:26:59,163
There's gotta be a way
to cut the power.

1092
01:26:59,164 --> 01:27:00,540
Charles...

1093
01:27:00,541 --> 01:27:02,570
you will send a message...

1094
01:27:02,595 --> 01:27:04,737
to every living mind.

1095
01:27:04,762 --> 01:27:08,524
You will tell them
that this earth will be laid waste.

1096
01:27:08,549 --> 01:27:10,653
That it is I,
En Sabah Nur...

1097
01:27:10,678 --> 01:27:13,272
who will wreak this upon them.

1098
01:27:18,617 --> 01:27:20,409
Now...

1099
01:27:20,644 --> 01:27:23,977
deliver my message.

1100
01:27:24,002 --> 01:27:25,818
Even if I wanted to...

1101
01:27:25,843 --> 01:27:29,528
I couldn't reach that many people.
I don't have Cerebro.

1102
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,448
You don't need a machine...

1103
01:27:33,449 --> 01:27:36,572
to amplify your powers.

1104
01:27:36,852 --> 01:27:38,966
You have me.

1105
01:27:51,842 --> 01:27:55,170
Guys, that could be
our way out of here.

1106
01:27:58,754 --> 01:28:01,464
You know him?
Magneto?

1107
01:28:02,269 --> 01:28:04,312
I used to.

1108
01:28:04,521 --> 01:28:06,182
Not so sure anymore.

1109
01:28:06,207 --> 01:28:07,770
What was he like?

1110
01:28:07,795 --> 01:28:12,338
Was he like they say he was?
Was he...

1111
01:28:12,636 --> 01:28:14,238
the bad guy?

1112
01:28:14,239 --> 01:28:16,031
No.

1113
01:28:16,426 --> 01:28:20,237
I mean, yeah.
He was...

1114
01:28:21,538 --> 01:28:24,707
Why do you care so much?
You see his speech on TV or something?

1115
01:28:24,708 --> 01:28:27,565
Yeah, but...

1116
01:28:31,256 --> 01:28:32,924
He's my father.

1117
01:28:32,925 --> 01:28:34,425
What?

1118
01:28:34,426 --> 01:28:36,636
- Him and my mom, they did it.
- No, I know...

1119
01:28:36,637 --> 01:28:37,785
Are you sure?

1120
01:28:37,810 --> 01:28:41,200
Yeah.
He left my mom before I was born.

1121
01:28:41,225 --> 01:28:44,294
I met him 1O years back...
but I didn't know it was him.

1122
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:47,271
By the time I figured it out,
it was too late.

1123
01:28:47,272 --> 01:28:49,201
Then, this week
I saw him on TV again...

1124
01:28:49,226 --> 01:28:51,931
and I came to that house,
looking for him...

1125
01:28:51,956 --> 01:28:54,875
but by the time
I got there...

1126
01:28:56,657 --> 01:28:58,508
Late again.

1127
01:29:00,536 --> 01:29:02,453
You know, for a guy
who moves as fast as me...

1128
01:29:02,454 --> 01:29:04,802
I always seem to be too late.

1129
01:29:05,541 --> 01:29:08,209
Let's hope not this time.

1130
01:29:08,585 --> 01:29:09,585
Yeah.

1131
01:29:09,586 --> 01:29:10,795
Seriously.

1132
01:29:10,796 --> 01:29:11,921
Hear me...

1133
01:29:11,946 --> 01:29:14,565
inhabitants of this world.

1134
01:29:14,590 --> 01:29:16,759
- What is that?
- This is a message.

1135
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:18,073
I think it's the Professor.

1136
01:29:18,098 --> 01:29:22,442
A message to every man, woman,
and mutant in the world.

1137
01:29:22,474 --> 01:29:26,018
You have lost your way.

1138
01:29:26,228 --> 01:29:28,592
You have lost your way.

1139
01:29:28,617 --> 01:29:30,916
But I have returned.

1140
01:29:30,941 --> 01:29:34,399
But I have returned.

1141
01:29:34,444 --> 01:29:38,132
The day of reckoning is here.

1142
01:29:38,485 --> 01:29:40,563
All your buildings...

1143
01:29:40,588 --> 01:29:45,112
...all of your towers and temples...

1144
01:29:45,137 --> 01:29:46,792
Will fall.

1145
01:29:46,817 --> 01:29:52,479
And the dawn of
a new age will rise.

1146
01:29:52,504 --> 01:29:54,879
...for there is nothing
you can do...

1147
01:29:54,904 --> 01:29:57,294
- Jean.
- ...to stop what is coming.

1148
01:29:57,319 --> 01:30:01,238
Jean, if you can hear me,
focus on my voice.

1149
01:30:01,263 --> 01:30:03,806
Cairo.
Find us, Jean.

1150
01:30:03,831 --> 01:30:06,201
Find us. Cairo.
Find us. Jean.

1151
01:30:06,226 --> 01:30:09,076
This message is for
one reason alone.

1152
01:30:09,101 --> 01:30:11,689
To tell the strongest among you...

1153
01:30:11,690 --> 01:30:15,508
Those with the greatest power...

1154
01:30:15,533 --> 01:30:19,240
this earth will be yours.

1155
01:30:19,265 --> 01:30:22,138
Those with the greatest power...

1156
01:30:25,245 --> 01:30:27,618
protect those without.

1157
01:30:30,098 --> 01:30:32,729
That's my message to the world.

1158
01:30:37,153 --> 01:30:39,776
How was Charles doing that
without Cerebro?

1159
01:30:39,801 --> 01:30:42,424
Sir, what was that voice?

1160
01:30:42,804 --> 01:30:44,055
I know that voice.

1161
01:30:44,056 --> 01:30:45,716
It's Xavier, isn't it?
What's going on?

1162
01:30:45,741 --> 01:30:48,159
- We don't know!
- We don't know, bro!

1163
01:30:48,435 --> 01:30:49,685
He just spoke to me.

1164
01:30:49,686 --> 01:30:51,521
I think he spoke to everyone.

1165
01:30:51,546 --> 01:30:52,821
- I could hear him, too.
- No, no...

1166
01:30:52,831 --> 01:30:54,934
he just sent me a hidden message.

1167
01:30:55,241 --> 01:30:57,443
One he knew only
I would hear.

1168
01:30:57,468 --> 01:30:59,250
I know where they are.

1169
01:30:59,529 --> 01:31:01,230
Hey!

1170
01:31:01,948 --> 01:31:04,693
We have shots fired!
Where's it coming from?

1171
01:31:05,535 --> 01:31:07,865
I have intruders in Quad Six.

1172
01:31:09,164 --> 01:31:11,832
Send a security team.
Take them out.

1173
01:31:19,007 --> 01:31:21,801
The generator.
It's worth a shot.

1174
01:31:22,010 --> 01:31:23,517
Kurt?

1175
01:31:44,658 --> 01:31:47,330
There's some kind
of animal in there.

1176
01:31:50,288 --> 01:31:52,613
It's no animal.

1177
01:31:53,609 --> 01:31:55,310
It's a man.

1178
01:31:55,335 --> 01:31:57,036
Who is he?

1179
01:31:57,754 --> 01:32:00,707
That part of him as been taken away.

1180
01:32:00,950 --> 01:32:02,169
What do you mean?

1181
01:32:02,194 --> 01:32:06,991
I mean they turned him into
some kind of weapon.

1182
01:32:11,437 --> 01:32:14,606
Charlie Three, report.
Did you find them?

1183
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:27,261
Shut it down.

1184
01:32:50,270 --> 01:32:51,846
Fire!

1185
01:33:02,152 --> 01:33:04,195
Weapon X is loose!

1186
01:33:04,196 --> 01:33:07,319
I repeat, Weapon X is loose!

1187
01:33:07,344 --> 01:33:09,009
I repeat, Weapon X is loose!

1188
01:33:09,034 --> 01:33:11,281
You sure he's not an animal?

1189
01:33:15,616 --> 01:33:19,036
- He's into the central halls.
- Engaging target Sector Five.

1190
01:33:19,723 --> 01:33:21,402
We can't stop h...

1191
01:33:36,561 --> 01:33:37,993
Hey!

1192
01:33:58,291 --> 01:34:00,070
- What are they doing?
- What's going on?

1193
01:34:00,095 --> 01:34:02,419
- I just lost feed.
- Hey! What's going on here?

1194
01:34:02,444 --> 01:34:03,578
Hey!

1195
01:34:04,172 --> 01:34:05,896
I'll be right back.

1196
01:34:08,599 --> 01:34:10,346
No!

1197
01:34:26,562 --> 01:34:29,273
Hey!
Stay where you are!

1198
01:34:30,707 --> 01:34:33,042
- No, no.
- Stop!

1199
01:34:48,508 --> 01:34:50,130
Scott, wait.

1200
01:34:51,996 --> 01:34:54,157
I can help you.

1201
01:34:59,477 --> 01:35:01,209
Jean.

1202
01:35:39,351 --> 01:35:41,183
Logan.

1203
01:36:29,234 --> 01:36:31,344
What'd you do to him?

1204
01:36:32,272 --> 01:36:36,007
I found a piece of his past
and gave it back to him.

1205
01:36:36,110 --> 01:36:38,947
Just the few memories
I could reach.

1206
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:43,544
I hope that's the last
we've seen of that guy.

1207
01:37:02,177 --> 01:37:03,756
Kurt.

1208
01:37:05,895 --> 01:37:07,396
- What?
- What?

1209
01:37:07,397 --> 01:37:08,948
Hey.

1210
01:37:13,445 --> 01:37:15,946
Stay away from the... door.

1211
01:37:15,947 --> 01:37:17,239
The what?

1212
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:18,677
The door...

1213
01:37:18,702 --> 01:37:19,950
Stay away from the...

1214
01:37:19,951 --> 01:37:21,243
- Get away from the door!
- The door!
- The door!

1215
01:37:21,244 --> 01:37:22,411
On three.

1216
01:37:22,412 --> 01:37:24,868
One... two...

1217
01:37:37,635 --> 01:37:39,303
We know where
the Professor is.

1218
01:37:39,304 --> 01:37:40,804
I think we might have
a way out of here.

1219
01:37:40,805 --> 01:37:44,480
- Well, you've been busy.
- We had a little help.

1220
01:37:44,809 --> 01:37:46,260
Let's go!

1221
01:37:49,064 --> 01:37:50,121
Jesus!

1222
01:37:50,146 --> 01:37:51,398
Oh, sorry!

1223
01:37:51,399 --> 01:37:53,121
This way!

1224
01:38:01,993 --> 01:38:04,661
This was meant to be
the center of the universe

1225
01:38:04,662 --> 01:38:06,580
before I was betrayed.

1226
01:38:06,581 --> 01:38:08,332
Now...

1227
01:38:08,333 --> 01:38:10,477
it will be.

1228
01:39:30,415 --> 01:39:31,845
Nice.

1229
01:39:31,942 --> 01:39:34,741
Hey, Hank, do you think
you can fly this thing?

1230
01:39:35,697 --> 01:39:38,053
Yeah, I can figure it out.

1231
01:39:38,948 --> 01:39:40,686
Hey, guys.

1232
01:39:41,009 --> 01:39:42,903
Flight suits.

1233
01:39:46,479 --> 01:39:48,557
You got your warplane.

1234
01:39:48,558 --> 01:39:50,635
Let's go to war.

1235
01:39:57,192 --> 01:39:59,109
A gift...

1236
01:39:59,110 --> 01:40:02,011
from the past you left behind...

1237
01:40:02,113 --> 01:40:05,532
and the future that lies ahead.

1238
01:40:06,367 --> 01:40:10,037
You will reach down, my son.

1239
01:40:10,038 --> 01:40:12,331
Deep into the earth.

1240
01:40:12,332 --> 01:40:15,751
Rip everything they've
built from the ground.

1241
01:40:15,752 --> 01:40:18,607
Wipe clean this world.

1242
01:40:18,632 --> 01:40:22,309
And we will lead those
that survive...

1243
01:40:22,334 --> 01:40:25,427
into a better one.

1244
01:40:25,428 --> 01:40:27,259
And me?

1245
01:40:28,271 --> 01:40:31,565
Am I to play a role
in this madness?

1246
01:40:32,435 --> 01:40:36,551
You have the most
important role of all.

1247
01:40:47,367 --> 01:40:49,576
Were you scared?

1248
01:40:49,577 --> 01:40:51,866
That day in D.C.,
were you scared?

1249
01:40:51,891 --> 01:40:53,433
No.

1250
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:01,696
But I was scared
on my first mission.

1251
01:41:01,965 --> 01:41:04,524
I was on a plane like this
with my friends.

1252
01:41:04,549 --> 01:41:06,331
About your age.

1253
01:41:09,389 --> 01:41:12,221
We called ourselves the X-Men.

1254
01:41:13,159 --> 01:41:15,143
Your brother was there.

1255
01:41:15,144 --> 01:41:17,062
We used to call him Havok.

1256
01:41:17,063 --> 01:41:19,568
He was a real handful, but...

1257
01:41:20,942 --> 01:41:23,942
when it came down to it,
he was very brave.

1258
01:41:25,863 --> 01:41:28,699
What happened to the rest of the kids
who went with you'?

1259
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:30,572
The X-Men?

1260
01:41:32,755 --> 01:41:35,253
Hank and I are
the only ones left.

1261
01:41:35,581 --> 01:41:38,124
I couldn't save
the rest of them.

1262
01:41:38,418 --> 01:41:40,640
I told you, I'm not a hero.

1263
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:43,497
Well, you're a hero to us.

1264
01:41:43,506 --> 01:41:45,424
Seeing you that day on TV

1265
01:41:45,425 --> 01:41:47,263
changed my life.

1266
01:41:47,288 --> 01:41:49,080
Mine, too.

1267
01:41:49,105 --> 01:41:50,806
Mine, too.

1268
01:41:52,223 --> 01:41:55,549
I mean, I still live in my mom's basement
but, you know...

1269
01:41:55,574 --> 01:41:57,714
everything else is...

1270
01:41:59,464 --> 01:42:01,859
It's pretty much the same.

1271
01:42:03,088 --> 01:42:05,165
I'm a total loser.

1272
01:43:04,567 --> 01:43:06,938
What we're seeing is
a magnetic phenomenon...

1273
01:43:06,963 --> 01:43:09,984
on a much larger scale
than what we saw at Auschwitz.

1274
01:43:10,009 --> 01:43:12,651
The ground is full
of magnetic elements.

1275
01:43:12,676 --> 01:43:14,388
Iron, nickel, cobalt.

1276
01:43:14,389 --> 01:43:16,932
The ocean's floor
is lined with them, too.

1277
01:43:16,933 --> 01:43:19,875
It's already begun
at the lowest depths.

1278
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:23,063
Land masses will slow it,
but not for long.

1279
01:43:23,064 --> 01:43:25,953
Eventually, cities, urban centers...

1280
01:43:25,978 --> 01:43:28,461
anything built since the Bronze Age...

1281
01:43:28,486 --> 01:43:29,945
will be wiped away.

1282
01:43:29,946 --> 01:43:31,381
The death toll
will be in the billions.

1283
01:43:31,391 --> 01:43:34,721
He's talking about
the whole goddamn world.

1284
01:44:23,143 --> 01:44:25,310
You're just another false god.

1285
01:44:25,543 --> 01:44:28,003
And whoever's left to follow you
when this all over...

1286
01:44:28,004 --> 01:44:31,459
they will betray you again.

1287
01:44:33,301 --> 01:44:35,635
You're wrong, Charles.

1288
01:44:35,636 --> 01:44:39,263
For the first time
in a thousand lifetimes...

1289
01:44:39,288 --> 01:44:41,289
I have you.

1290
01:44:41,392 --> 01:44:47,388
For all my gifts, I have yet
to possess the one I needed most.

1291
01:44:47,648 --> 01:44:49,607
To be...

1292
01:44:49,632 --> 01:44:52,255
everywhere.

1293
01:44:54,572 --> 01:44:56,507
To be...

1294
01:44:56,532 --> 01:44:58,652
everyone.

1295
01:45:13,591 --> 01:45:16,012
Seventh wonder, 12 o'clock.

1296
01:45:23,768 --> 01:45:26,687
He has the Professor
in the center of the pyramid.

1297
01:45:27,106 --> 01:45:30,673
He's going to transfer
his consciousness into the Professor.

1298
01:45:30,698 --> 01:45:32,544
If he does that,
he'll have the power

1299
01:45:32,569 --> 01:45:35,404
to control every
mind in the world.

1300
01:45:41,869 --> 01:45:44,820
What the hell is that?

1301
01:45:45,096 --> 01:45:46,968
It's Erik.

1302
01:45:56,050 --> 01:45:58,987
You guys help Nightcrawler
get into the pyramid.

1303
01:45:59,971 --> 01:46:02,404
Get Charles.
I'll take care of Erik.

1304
01:46:02,429 --> 01:46:04,730
How are we gonna
get through that?

1305
01:46:05,309 --> 01:46:07,143
I can get you in there.

1306
01:46:07,144 --> 01:46:09,609
I came here for him.
Let me help you.

1307
01:46:10,064 --> 01:46:12,704
The rest of you, get Charles on this
plane and get him out of here.

1308
01:46:12,728 --> 01:46:15,274
- We're not leaving without you!
- Don't worry.

1309
01:46:15,403 --> 01:46:16,653
We'll catch up.

1310
01:46:16,654 --> 01:46:18,284
Hold on.

1311
01:46:48,273 --> 01:46:49,649
Hank, you go with the kids.

1312
01:46:49,674 --> 01:46:51,930
- Moira will be waiting on the plane.
- Wait.

1313
01:46:52,356 --> 01:46:53,523
What?

1314
01:46:53,524 --> 01:46:56,359
Not all of us can
fully control our powers.

1315
01:46:56,360 --> 01:46:58,028
Then don't.

1316
01:46:58,029 --> 01:47:00,402
You need to embrace them.

1317
01:47:03,034 --> 01:47:04,826
We all do.

1318
01:47:28,154 --> 01:47:31,227
Go.
Join the others.

1319
01:47:31,228 --> 01:47:35,102
Protect me,
until the transference is complete.

1320
01:47:59,472 --> 01:48:01,674
There's an entrance.
It's clear.

1321
01:48:05,429 --> 01:48:07,722
Kurt!
Get in there!

1322
01:48:17,758 --> 01:48:19,862
In the pyramid!
Move!

1323
01:48:20,027 --> 01:48:21,528
Go!

1324
01:48:57,679 --> 01:48:59,505
Split them up.

1325
01:49:22,339 --> 01:49:24,040
Professor...

1326
01:49:27,344 --> 01:49:28,678
Kurt, you have to hurry!

1327
01:49:28,679 --> 01:49:31,673
I'm trying.
It's like a maze in here.

1328
01:49:41,192 --> 01:49:42,804
Kurt, no!

1329
01:50:07,718 --> 01:50:10,528
The magnetic field is too strong.
I can't get us in there.

1330
01:50:12,602 --> 01:50:14,394
Erik!

1331
01:50:20,843 --> 01:50:22,544
Mystique.

1332
01:50:26,300 --> 01:50:29,253
I know you think
you've lost everything.

1333
01:50:29,949 --> 01:50:32,005
But you haven't.

1334
01:50:32,993 --> 01:50:35,036
You have me.

1335
01:50:35,412 --> 01:50:37,534
You have Charles.

1336
01:50:43,151 --> 01:50:45,954
You have more family
than you know.

1337
01:50:47,020 --> 01:50:50,394
You never had the chance
to save your family before.

1338
01:50:50,872 --> 01:50:53,088
But you do now.

1339
01:50:55,266 --> 01:50:57,934
That's what I've come here
to tell you.

1340
01:51:03,148 --> 01:51:04,871
And you?

1341
01:51:13,617 --> 01:51:15,131
I'm your...

1342
01:51:19,623 --> 01:51:22,178
I'm here for my family, too.

1343
01:52:11,252 --> 01:52:13,294
Get out.
Get out!

1344
01:52:13,319 --> 01:52:15,255
GET OUT!

1345
01:52:21,393 --> 01:52:23,194
Auf Wiedersehen.
(Until we meet again.)

1346
01:52:34,392 --> 01:52:36,253
We're losing him.

1347
01:52:51,970 --> 01:52:53,709
I'll be right back.

1348
01:53:04,275 --> 01:53:06,420
Scott, glasses on!

1349
01:53:15,663 --> 01:53:17,205
Let's go!

1350
01:53:33,491 --> 01:53:35,499
- Locked on.
- Here we go.

1351
01:53:52,538 --> 01:53:54,410
Psylocke!

1352
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:11,965
What the hell was that?

1353
01:54:18,175 --> 01:54:19,469
Kurt.

1354
01:54:19,470 --> 01:54:21,044
Everyone, grab hold of Nightcrawler!

1355
01:54:21,069 --> 01:54:22,472
I've never done it
with this many people.

1356
01:54:22,473 --> 01:54:24,242
Get us out of here.

1357
01:54:39,323 --> 01:54:41,195
Kurt, hurry!

1358
01:54:42,153 --> 01:54:43,613
Kurt!

1359
01:55:09,103 --> 01:55:10,844
Charles...

1360
01:55:16,133 --> 01:55:17,393
Is he okay?

1361
01:55:17,418 --> 01:55:19,899
It's his energy.
He's drained.

1362
01:55:20,931 --> 01:55:22,198
Get out.

1363
01:55:22,223 --> 01:55:24,200
Get...
Get out!

1364
01:55:24,201 --> 01:55:27,343
Professor. Professor, it's okay.
You're with us.

1365
01:55:27,621 --> 01:55:29,454
It's okay.

1366
01:55:37,744 --> 01:55:40,805
I'm going to fight
for what I have left.

1367
01:55:43,875 --> 01:55:45,701
Are you?

1368
01:55:58,503 --> 01:56:01,007
There's so much more to you
than you know.

1369
01:56:01,196 --> 01:56:04,006
Not just pain and anger.

1370
01:56:04,324 --> 01:56:06,743
There's good, too.
I felt it.

1371
01:56:06,768 --> 01:56:08,823
It's not just me
you're walking away from.

1372
01:56:08,848 --> 01:56:13,237
Here, you have the chance to be a part of
something much bigger than yourself.

1373
01:56:13,262 --> 01:56:15,948
And it needs you, Erik.

1374
01:56:44,872 --> 01:56:47,266
Useless.

1375
01:56:52,331 --> 01:56:54,374
Charles.

1376
01:56:55,792 --> 01:56:58,702
I know you can hear me.

1377
01:56:58,896 --> 01:57:02,766
We're still connected.

1378
01:57:05,663 --> 01:57:07,364
Charles!

1379
01:57:07,721 --> 01:57:09,843
Show yourself!

1380
01:57:10,194 --> 01:57:12,497
Charles!

1381
01:57:13,101 --> 01:57:15,575
Show yourself!

1382
01:57:44,925 --> 01:57:47,453
Foolish child.

1383
01:57:55,539 --> 01:57:57,104
Peter.

1384
01:58:13,826 --> 01:58:15,625
End him.

1385
01:58:37,109 --> 01:58:40,722
(Great fighter. She's my hero.
I want to be like her. )

1386
01:58:41,597 --> 01:58:43,298
Raven.

1387
01:58:50,532 --> 01:58:52,698
The great hero.

1388
01:58:57,150 --> 01:58:59,373
- I'm going out there.
- I'm going with you.

1389
01:58:59,374 --> 01:59:00,898
No.

1390
01:59:01,390 --> 01:59:02,780
It's me he wants.

1391
01:59:02,805 --> 01:59:04,855
Charles, you can't give yourself up.

1392
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:06,922
If he has you,
he has us all.

1393
01:59:06,923 --> 01:59:08,587
The whole world.

1394
01:59:08,612 --> 01:59:10,294
You are feeble.

1395
01:59:10,319 --> 01:59:12,448
Just like the others.

1396
01:59:12,473 --> 01:59:14,276
Charles!

1397
01:59:14,301 --> 01:59:15,336
Come!

1398
01:59:15,361 --> 01:59:17,688
Rescue your weaklings!

1399
01:59:17,713 --> 01:59:20,807
Give your life for theirs!

1400
01:59:21,938 --> 01:59:23,639
No.

1401
01:59:31,283 --> 01:59:33,030
He was right.

1402
01:59:33,475 --> 01:59:36,678
There is still some part of me
connected to him.

1403
01:59:36,703 --> 01:59:37,798
Charles!

1404
01:59:37,823 --> 01:59:39,294
I can get inside his head.

1405
01:59:39,319 --> 01:59:41,819
Will you do nothing?

1406
01:59:42,751 --> 01:59:45,203
Thank you for letting me in.

1407
02:00:02,646 --> 02:00:04,495
You want what I have?

1408
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:07,094
You want to feel
what I feel?

1409
02:00:18,328 --> 02:00:20,371
Welcome to my world!

1410
02:00:21,832 --> 02:00:23,870
You're in my house now!

1411
02:00:33,728 --> 02:00:36,394
You'll need a bigger house.

1412
02:01:55,269 --> 02:01:56,991
You betray me?

1413
02:01:57,016 --> 02:01:58,628
No.

1414
02:01:58,845 --> 02:02:01,025
I betrayed them.

1415
02:02:28,625 --> 02:02:29,889
Let's jump.

1416
02:02:29,914 --> 02:02:31,359
What?

1417
02:02:36,132 --> 02:02:37,674
Cover me.

1418
02:02:39,594 --> 02:02:41,373
I got you.

1419
02:02:46,268 --> 02:02:47,825
Come on!

1420
02:03:08,849 --> 02:03:11,661
They lack strength, Charles.

1421
02:03:17,553 --> 02:03:19,056
Jean.

1422
02:03:24,472 --> 02:03:26,345
Come here.

1423
02:03:38,215 --> 02:03:39,607
Help...

1424
02:03:42,049 --> 02:03:43,582
me.

1425
02:03:48,256 --> 02:03:49,809
Stay here.

1426
02:03:58,917 --> 02:04:01,020
They can't stop him.

1427
02:04:01,134 --> 02:04:03,006
Jean.

1428
02:04:04,721 --> 02:04:07,370
Help me!

1429
02:04:30,081 --> 02:04:31,661
Hank!

1430
02:04:32,465 --> 02:04:34,119
Hank!

1431
02:04:40,576 --> 02:04:43,703
It's over, Charles.
You're finished.

1432
02:04:43,728 --> 02:04:46,021
You're mine now.

1433
02:04:47,764 --> 02:04:50,794
You will never win.

1434
02:04:50,819 --> 02:04:53,096
And why is that?

1435
02:04:53,125 --> 02:04:55,265
Because you are alone.

1436
02:04:57,062 --> 02:05:01,116
And I am not!

1437
02:05:12,633 --> 02:05:14,210
Let...

1438
02:05:14,235 --> 02:05:15,999
go.

1439
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,664
Unleash your power, Jean.

1440
02:05:19,370 --> 02:05:21,367
No fear.

1441
02:06:08,357 --> 02:06:11,322
Unleash your power!

1442
02:06:11,347 --> 02:06:13,569
Let go, Jean!

1443
02:06:13,594 --> 02:06:16,322
JEAN, LET GO!

1444
02:06:51,304 --> 02:06:53,374
He's getting away.

1445
02:07:10,448 --> 02:07:14,233
All is revealed.

1446
02:08:15,943 --> 02:08:18,318
Charles!
Charles!

1447
02:08:19,142 --> 02:08:20,309
- We've lost him!
- Charles.

1448
02:08:20,310 --> 02:08:22,144
- He's gone.
- No, Charles.

1449
02:08:22,145 --> 02:08:23,645
Charles...

1450
02:08:23,646 --> 02:08:25,440
No, he's not.

1451
02:08:26,193 --> 02:08:28,145
I can still feel him.

1452
02:08:51,853 --> 02:08:53,987
Thank you, Jean.

1453
02:08:55,428 --> 02:08:57,129
Charles?

1454
02:08:57,500 --> 02:08:59,827
Charles, do you know where you are?

1455
02:09:02,549 --> 02:09:04,780
I'm on a beach.

1456
02:09:10,416 --> 02:09:12,448
In Cuba.

1457
02:09:13,867 --> 02:09:15,530
With you.

1458
02:09:15,531 --> 02:09:17,469
What beach?

1459
02:09:24,433 --> 02:09:26,148
Charles Xavier.

1460
02:09:52,500 --> 02:09:54,292
I'm sorry.

1461
02:09:54,570 --> 02:09:57,732
I should never have taken
those from you.

1462
02:10:00,435 --> 02:10:02,151
Hold on!

1463
02:10:06,457 --> 02:10:08,287
What did I miss?

1464
02:10:10,628 --> 02:10:13,255
It seems only by the grace of God...

1465
02:10:13,256 --> 02:10:14,631
that the ominous destruction...

1466
02:10:14,656 --> 02:10:16,577
seen from one end of the globe
to the other, has stopped.

1467
02:10:16,587 --> 02:10:20,457
At a debriefing held earlier today,
CIA Special Agent Moira MacTaggert...

1468
02:10:20,482 --> 02:10:22,514
revealed to an investigative committee...

1469
02:10:22,515 --> 02:10:25,642
The committee was further stunned
to learn that fugitive Erik Lehnsherr

1470
02:10:25,643 --> 02:10:28,227
aided in defeating this
powerful and unknown mutant.

1471
02:10:28,252 --> 02:10:30,606
I think our prayers were answered.

1472
02:10:31,107 --> 02:10:32,691
Thank you, Mr. President.

1473
02:10:32,692 --> 02:10:34,689
The potential destructive power
of mutants is sure to fuel

1474
02:10:34,699 --> 02:10:36,611
new controversy and debate...

1475
02:10:36,612 --> 02:10:40,741
at a time when mutants were becoming
accepted around the world.

1476
02:11:07,523 --> 02:11:10,358
Mystique told me he is your father.

1477
02:11:11,022 --> 02:11:13,183
Are you gonna tell him?

1478
02:11:14,481 --> 02:11:16,182
I might...

1479
02:11:16,274 --> 02:11:17,958
one day.

1480
02:11:18,988 --> 02:11:22,217
I think for now, I'm just gonna
stick around here for a while.

1481
02:11:27,701 --> 02:11:29,573
Me, too.

1482
02:11:39,926 --> 02:11:43,553
The world's already begun
rebuilding its arsenals.

1483
02:11:43,554 --> 02:11:46,284
It's human nature, Charles.

1484
02:11:47,667 --> 02:11:49,818
I still have hope.

1485
02:11:50,084 --> 02:11:51,785
Oh, yes.

1486
02:11:52,605 --> 02:11:54,397
"Hope".

1487
02:11:54,524 --> 02:11:56,903
I was right about Raven.

1488
02:11:57,234 --> 02:11:59,698
I was even right about you.

1489
02:12:02,281 --> 02:12:04,483
What about the rest
of the world?

1490
02:12:05,302 --> 02:12:08,925
Doesn't it ever wake you up
in the middle of the night?

1491
02:12:10,581 --> 02:12:13,792
The feeling that one day
they'll come for you...

1492
02:12:13,793 --> 02:12:15,972
and your children.

1493
02:12:17,350 --> 02:12:19,291
It does, indeed.

1494
02:12:19,316 --> 02:12:21,867
What do you do
when you wake up to that?

1495
02:12:23,261 --> 02:12:25,753
I feel a great swell of pity
for the poor soul...

1496
02:12:25,778 --> 02:12:29,291
that comes to my school
looking for trouble.

1497
02:12:34,230 --> 02:12:37,149
You're sure I can't
convince you to stay?

1498
02:12:38,109 --> 02:12:40,402
You're psychic, Charles.

1499
02:12:40,403 --> 02:12:43,114
You can convince me
to do anything.

1500
02:12:45,074 --> 02:12:47,194
Goodbye, old friend.

1501
02:12:47,785 --> 02:12:50,033
Good luck, Professor.

1502
02:12:54,667 --> 02:12:57,186
Forget everything you think you know.

1503
02:12:58,181 --> 02:13:01,259
Whatever lessons you learned
in school...

1504
02:13:01,379 --> 02:13:03,927
whatever your parents taught you.

1505
02:13:05,315 --> 02:13:08,859
None of that matters!

1506
02:13:09,599 --> 02:13:12,017
You're not kids anymore.

1507
02:13:12,018 --> 02:13:14,345
You're not students.

1508
02:13:17,788 --> 02:13:20,099
You're X-Men.

1509
02:14:06,320 --> 02:14:11,389
