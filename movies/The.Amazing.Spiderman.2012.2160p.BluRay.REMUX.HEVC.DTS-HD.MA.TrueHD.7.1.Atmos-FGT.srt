1
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,480
Five, four, three...

2
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,275
...two, one.

3
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,901
Ready or not, here I come.

4
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,603
Hey, Dad?

5
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,814
Dad!

6
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,131
You'll stay with Aunt May
and Uncle Ben for a little while.

7
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,466
- I wanna go with you.
- No.

8
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,973
Doesn't like crust on his sandwiches...

9
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,392
...and he likes to sleep with a little light on.

10
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,686
- Mary. Come on, come on.
- Oh, God.

11
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,400
Dad.

12
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,944
Be good.

13
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,548
- Sorry.
- Morning, Flash.

14
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,011
Good morning, Parker.

19
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,190
- Mm-hm.
- I really like your photos.

20
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,608
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

21
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,611

Uh...

00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:46,119
Cool. Uh, can you take pictures
of my boyfriend's car?

24
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,288
You know, I really wanna
frame a good one...

25
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,539
...for his birthday.

26
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:53,168
That's really nice of you.
Wow, that's such a nice thought. Um...

27
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,295
Yeah, I'll have a look at the old, uh...

- Okay.

29

Parker.

30
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,718
- Yes, sir?
- You want to keep that skateboard?

31
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,386
- Yeah.
- Keep it off the ground.

32
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,888
- Sure. Yeah.
- Wheels up.

33
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,181

00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,058

Come on!

45
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,387
Hey, Parker, come on.

46
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:46,930
Get a picture of this.

47
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,267
No, I'm not gonna take a picture of it.
Put him down, man.

48
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,394
- Come on.
- Gordon, don't eat it.

49
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:53,603
Take the picture.

50
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,230
Put him down, Flash.

51
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,982
Take the picture.

52
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,734
Put him down, Eugene!

53
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,236
Aw...

54
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,114
Hey, man.

55
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:05,657
Oh!

56
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,784
Come on! Get up, Parker!

57
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,664
Get up! Come on! Come on!

58
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:13,832
- Get up!
- Ooh!

59
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,794
Still not taking the picture.

60
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,629
Stay down, Parker!

61
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,631
Who wants one more?

62
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,383
- One more! Huh? Huh?
- Flash!

63
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,218
Flash...

64
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,304
...we still on for after school today?

65
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,597
My house, 3:30?

66
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,973
I hope you did homework.

67
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,641
Last time, I was...

68
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,435
...disappointed in you.

69
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,687
- Okay, move.
- No, how about we go to class?

70
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,063
Hm? How about it?

71
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,443
Whatever.

72
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,428
I thought that was great what you did.

73
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,555
It was stupid...

74
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,223
...but it was great.

75
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,977
You should go to the nurse.
You might have a concussion.

76
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,064
What's your name?

77
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,690
You don't know my name?

78
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,859
No, I know your name.

79
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,736
I want to know if you know your name.

80
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,031
Peter.

81
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,284
- Parker. Peter Parker.
- Okay. Okay, good.

82
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,543
I'd still go to the nurse though.

83
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,962
You're Gwen, right?

84
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,338
Gwen Stacy.

85
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,340
All right.

86
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,259
Hey.

87
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,221
I'm making spaghetti
and meatballs tonight.

88
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,057
You're serious?
Spaghetti and meatballs.

89
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,936
Since when don't you like
spaghetti and meatballs, huh?

90
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,146
- Oh, my God.
- What's up?

91
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,856
- What happened to your face?
- Oh.

92
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,401
I'm all right. Just... I fell, skating.

93
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,152
It's all right.

94
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,863
Ben Parker, don't you even...

95
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,992
...think about leaving
that filthy box in my kitchen.

96
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,201
My bowling trophies.

97
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,579
Oh, well, then, by all means
leave that box in my kitchen.

98
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,206
- What happened to you?
- He fell.

99
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:21,167
Why you kids ride those
things, I'll never know.

100
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,919
Because it's stupid and dangerous.

101
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,713
Remember when we were stupid?

102
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,880
No.

103
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,174
- Trust me, we were.
- All right. Good to know.

104
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,927
- Where's the flood?
- Follow me. I'll show you.

105
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,804
- You serious?
- Yes.

106
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,097
All right.

107
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,475
It's the condenser tray.

108
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,687
Too much water for the condenser tray
or the heat exchange tubing.

109
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,772
This has got to be the fill line.

110
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,316
That's the only thing that
makes any sense. Heh.

111
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,818
Can you fix it?

112
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,238
No, not tonight.
I'll go by the hardware store tomorrow.

113
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,824
Good deal. And meanwhile,
put this on your face.

114
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,536
How's the other guy look?

115
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:01,249
Come on. I know a right
cross when I see one.

116
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,211
Yes or no? Do I have to call
somebody's father?

117
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,922
- No, no.
- All right.

118
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,175
Well, I wouldn't tell your Aunt May.

119
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,636
I pity the poor kid who'd have
to suffer her wrath.

120
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,890
Before you come up, see if...

121
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,476
- ...there's anything else worth saving.
- Okay.

122
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,995
- Plumbers don't fix appliances.
- Yes, they do.

123
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,373
- They fix pipes and pump things.
- If you ask them to...

124
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,339
I forgot all about that thing.

125
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,548
It was your dad's.

126
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,426
- Yeah.
- He asked us to keep it safe.

127
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,808
He saw it in the window of that
leather shop over on 9th Avenue.

128
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,645
He was 19. What does a 19-year-old
kid need with a briefcase?

129
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,605
And guess who sold it to him.

130
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,440
- I don't know.
- Your mother.

131
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,691
That's how they met.

132
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,779
He asked you to keep this safe?
There's nothing in here.

133
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,697
Have you looked?
There's nothing here.

134
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,991
Your father was a very
secretive man, Peter.

135
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,661
Yeah, I know.

136
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,378
Who's that?
Do you know who that is?

137
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:31,172
Some guy who worked
with your dad, I guess.

138
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,971
Just take this off the table, all right?

139
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,182
We're gonna eat. Off.
And wash your hands.

140
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,226
- Now.
- All right.

141
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,394
Go on.

142
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,639
<i>I need you to be a good boy.</i>

143
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:22,932
Where are you going?

144
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,267
There's something, uh...

145
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,436
...your mom and I have to do.

146
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,827
What is this?

147
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,958
"Zero, zero, decay rate algorithm."

148
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,379
Yeah, one sec, one sec.

149
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,180
Come in.

150
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,141
- You okay?
- Yeah. What's up?

151
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,644
Oh, my God.
You look just like him.

152
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,605
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

153
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,945
Listen, um...

154
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,571
...I don't have much education.

155
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,198
You know that, Peter.

156
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:06,035
Hell, I stopped being able to help
with your homework when you were 10.

157
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,788
What I'm trying to say is...

158
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,708
...I know it's been rough
for you without your dad.

159
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,043
And I know we don't talk much about them.

160
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,672
- Yeah, it's all right.
- No, it is not all right.

161
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:21,342
I wish I could change it, but I can't.

162
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,595
Curt Connors.

163
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,016
That's the name of the guy
in the picture with your dad.

164
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,518
They worked together for years
and they were close.

165
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,062
But after that night,
we never saw him again.

166
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,189
He never even called.

167
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,566
Not once.

168
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,695
Go figure.

169
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,451
She's pretty.

170
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:51,748
Uncle Ben.

171
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,166
What?

172
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,251
You're a pretty great dad.

173
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,559
- Excuse me.
- What?

174
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,311
- Can I help you?
- Oh, uh...

175
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,855
I don't know.
I'm here to see Dr Connors.

176
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,817
Right. You'll find yourself to the left.

177
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,404
You are here for the internship?

178
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,656
Yeah. Yeah.

179
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:07,907
Okay.

180
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,951
You'll find your badge to the left.

181
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,453
Oh.

182
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,501
- Having trouble finding yourself?
- No.

183
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,002
Yeah, I got it.

184
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,881
Okay, Mr Guevara.

185
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,137
<i>Welcome to Oscorp.</i>

186
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,140
<i>Born from the mind of our founder,
Norman Osborn...</i>

187
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,977
<i>...the Oscorp Tower houses
108 floors of innovation.</i>

188
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:41,149
<i>Our scientific minds are pushing
the boundaries of defense, biomedical...</i>

189
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,110
<i>...and chemical technologies.
The future lies within.</i>

190
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,570
Welcome to Oscorp.

191
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:49,657
I'm Gwen Stacy, a senior at Midtown Science
and head intern to Dr Connors.

192
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,993
I'll be with you for the duration of your visit.

193
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,079
Where I go, you go. That's the rule.

194
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,331
- Remember that all will be fine.
- Come on!

195
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,875
- If you forget that...
- Listen!

196
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,711
Look, listen.
Tell them Rodrigo Guevara is here.

197
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,172
Just tell them Rodrigo Guevara is here!

198
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,506
My name's Rodrigo!

199
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,509
I guess I don't need to tell you
what happens if you forget.

200
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,386
Shall we?

201
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,687
Come around this way.

202
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,067
Good afternoon, Gwen.

203
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,235
Dr Connors.

204
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:31,073
Welcome. My name is Dr. Curtis Connors.

205
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,493
Yes, in case you're wondering,
I'm a southpaw.

206
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,162
- Ha-ha.
- I'm not a cripple, I'm a scientist...

207
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,748
...and the world's foremost
authority on herpetology.

208
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,334
That's reptiles, for those
of you who don't know.

209
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,960
Like the Parkinson's patient...

210
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,838
...who watches on in horror as her body...

211
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,425
...slowly betrays her, or the man
with macular degeneration...

212
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:53,429
...whose eyes grow dimmer
each day, I long to fix myself.

213
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:57,433
I want to create a world without weakness.

214
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,561
Anyone care to venture a guess just how?

215
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:03,064
- Yes.
- Stem cells?

216
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,815
Promising. But the solution...

217
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,777
...I'm thinking of is more radical.

218
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,949
- No one?
- Cross-species genetics.

219
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:23,626
Person gets Parkinson's when the brain
cells that produce dopamine...

220
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,795
...start to disappear.

221
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,630
But a zebra fish has the ability...

222
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,007
...to regenerate cells on command.

223
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,093
If you could give this ability...

224
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,137
...to the woman you're talking
about, that's that. She's...

225
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,515
She's curing herself.

226
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,768
Yeah, you just have to look
past the gills on her neck.

227
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,314
And you are...?

228
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,360
He's one of Midtown Science's...

229
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,028
- ...best and brightest.
- Really?

230
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,196
Second in his class.

231
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:53,906
- Oh.
- Second?

232
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,158
- Yeah.
- Sure about that?

233
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,785
I'm pretty sure.

234
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:05,167
I'm afraid duty calls. I'll leave you in the
more-than-capable hands of Miss Stacy.

235
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,211
Nice meeting you all.

236
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,841
If you'd like to gather round.

237
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,802
<i>Welcome to Oscorp's tree of life.</i>

238
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,597
<i>Our planet's tree of life is immense.</i>

239
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:21,183
- <i>At Oscorp's Cross-Species Division...</i>
- Hi.

240
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,353
<i>...we endeavor to explore
exciting new methods...</i>

241
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,981
- Ahem.
- What are you doing, "Rodrigo"?

242
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,277
Oh, yeah.

243
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,695
What are you doing here?

244
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,030
I work here. I don't.

245
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,781
I was gonna say I work here...

246
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,160
...but it seems like you do work here.
So you know that I don't.

247
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,954
- You following me?
- No, I'm not following you, no.

248
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,497
I had no idea you worked here.

249
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,874
Why would you be here?

250
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,876
I just snuck in because...

251
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,461
I love science.

252
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,421
- You love it.
- I'm passionate about it.

253
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,214
So you snuck in...?

254
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,550
- I have to lead this tour group.
- I know.

255
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,637
I'll ask you more about this later.
Do not get me in trouble.

256
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,056
- I promise you I won't.
- Stay with the group.

257
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:04,185
All right, guys? I'm gonna take you
to the bioreactor room now.

258
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,482
Sorry. Yo.

259
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,984
Sorry.

260
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:39,006
We received the results from the mRNA
sequences this morning.

261
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,967
They were disappointing.

262
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,891
Define "disappointing."

263
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,392
Another dead end.

264
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,228
It's the decay rate algorithm.

265
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,897
- And this is to be expected.
- Expected?

266
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,398
You said you were close.

267
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,734
We are close, but it's gonna take time.

268
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,110
He doesn't have time.

269
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,571
Norman Osborn is dying, Dr Connors.

270
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,365
Save him.

271
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,536
Or we'll both lose our heads.

272
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,389
All right, give me the badge.

273
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,934
Give it to me.

274
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,981
Sorry.

275
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,194
Aah. Aah, aah.

276
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,252
Disgusting. Now I smell like beer.

277
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,005
I didn't mean to do that.

278
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,590
I didn't mean to...

279
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,508
I didn't... I didn't...

280
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,011
Get your hand off her!

281
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:50,846
I'm trying to get my...

282
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:55,434
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Are you kidding?

283
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,770
- I'm sorry.
- Are you kidding me?

284
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,064
- Hey, get him, Rudy!
- Hey!

285
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,526
Man, I'm sorry!

286
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,778
Man, are you all right?

287
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,240
- Take him down!
- Come on.

288
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,453
Get him, man! Get him!

289
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,499
No, man, no. Not my board.

290
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:19,959
Please, dude, don't...

291
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:22,962
Sorry!

292
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:27,925
Sorry. Sorry.

293
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,385
I'm so sorry.

294
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,891
<i>Coney Island, next stop.</i>

295
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,018
<i>Next and final stop, Coney Island.</i>

296
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:50,823
Ah... Hey.

297
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,200
Hey. Hey.

298
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:54,576
Sorry. I'm late.

299
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,412
- I got...
- We've been so worried.

300
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,705
I know. I'm sorry.

301
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,206
Watch out!

302
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,464
That's a fly, Peter.

303
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,178
Yeah.

304
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,643
I'm so sorry...

305
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:20,978
...I kept you guys up.

306
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:24,481
I'm insensitive, I'm irresponsible...

307
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,442
...and I'm hungry.

308
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,531
Meat loaf.

309
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,285
Drinking?

310
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:37,494
What's this?

311
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,038
I don't think so.

312
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,873
This is your meat loaf.

313
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,127
This beats all other meat loafs.

314
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,422
Something is very wrong.

315
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,090
Yeah.

316
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,301
Nobody likes your meat loaf.

317
00:25:58,474 --> 00:25:59,975
I got it.

318
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,814
He took the frozen macaroni and cheese.

319
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,816
I noticed that.

320
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,612
Why didn't you tell me you
didn't like my meat loaf?

321
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:14,073
You could have said that
to me 37 years ago.

322
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,909
How many meat loafs have I made for you?

323
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,895
Aah.

Peter.

332
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,333
- Mm.
- What are you doing?

333
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,001
I'm, uh...

334
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,797
- Homework.
- Be careful.

335
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,548
Sure.

336
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,184
Dr Connors.

337
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:34,106
- Uh... You don't remember me. I, uh...
- The intern from the other day.

338
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,358
Yeah, yeah. That's right, yeah.

339
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,819
I'm sure you're very nice,
but this is a home.

340
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:41,321
I ask you to make
an appointment with my office.

341
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:42,864
I'm Richard Parker's son.

342
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,331
Peter?

343
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:58,088
I'm afraid I can't help you much.
I don't know why they left or where they...

344
00:29:58,255 --> 00:29:59,881
...were going.

345
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,260
Good reflexes.

346
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:04,803
Thank you.

347
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,893
- Thank you.
- I read your book.

348
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,520
- Oh?
- Yeah.

349
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:14,855
It's something, you know.

350
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:18,483
So you really think it's possible,
cross-species genetics?

351
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,693
Yes, of course.

352
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,321
Your father and I were
mocked for our theories.

353
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,240
Not just in the community at large,
but at Oscorp, as well.

354
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,534
They called us mad scientists.

355
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:31,038
And then your father bred the spiders...

356
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,581
...and everything changed.

357
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,416
The results were beyond encouraging.

358
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,543
They were spectacular.

359
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,673
We were gonna change
the lives of millions.

360
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,800
Including my own.

361
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:45,886
Then it was over.

362
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:49,681
He was gone.

363
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,351
Took his research with him.

364
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:56,021
And I knew without him, I...

365
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,197
I...

366
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,950
I was angry.

367
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,205
So I stayed away from you...

368
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,290
...and your family.

369
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,376
And for that, I'm truly sorry.

370
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,386
Say...

371
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,137
Say it worked.

372
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,473
Say you got it to work.

373
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:35,936
Like, how much would
the foreign species take over?

374
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,980
What could the side effects be?

375
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,779
It's hard to say,
considering no subject survived.

376
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,572
The problem was always...

377
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,157
The decay rate algorithm?

378
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,620
- Right.
- Right.

379
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,164
Can I, uh...?

380
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,999
Of course.

381
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:21,857
Extraordinary.

382
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,317
How did you come up with this?

383
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,618
Peter, how about coming
to see me at the Tower...

384
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,704
- ...one day after school?
- Yeah.

385
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,666
Thank you.

386
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,397
Number one, Reggie. Run it, buddy.

387
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,107
Let's go, Reggie.

388
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,528
Rejected!

389
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,657
You did that on purpose, Flash!

390
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,910
I should've.
You better watch your back.

391
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,540
Hey.

392
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,418
All right?

393
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,718
Give it up.

394
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,516
Come on, man.

395
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,267
Oh...

396
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,435
One sec.

397
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:46,233
- Come on, man.
- Why don't you take it from me?

398
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,448
- That's right. Take it.
- Go ahead. Take it.

399
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:05,877
Oh!

400
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,428
Just take it.

401
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,808
All right, how about this?

402
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:21,643
All right?

403
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:22,811
How about that?

404
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:29,109
- Come on, Flash.
- Flash, stop playing, man.

405
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:31,403
- Take it from him!
- Come on, Flash. Take it.

406
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,904
Yo, Flash, let's go.

407
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,573
- Let's go!
- Do it, Flash.

408
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,491
- Stop playing, man.
- Let's go, Flash.

409
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,785
- What are you doing?
- What's up?

410
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,079
What you doing?

411
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,001
All right, bring it!
Come on, Parker! Come on!

412
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,142
Peter's behavior is just unacceptable.

413
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:04,144
They won't make us pay
for the backboard.

414
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:06,187
I don't care about the backboard.

415
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,064
- Was that true?
- What?

416
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,025
What I heard in there just now.

417
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:13,153
Did you humiliate that boy?

418
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,196
Yeah, I did.

419
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,365
- But...
- But what?

420
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,992
- This guy deserved it.
- Did he?

421
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,869
- Yeah.
- Is he the kid that hit you?

422
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,456
Is he?

423
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,458
Yeah, yeah, but...

424
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,710
So all this is about getting even.

425
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,714
If so, I guess you must feel pretty
good about yourself now, right?

426
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:33,882
Am I right or wrong?

427
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:37,469
Yeah, I thought so.

428
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,430
Well, thanks to this little
escapade of yours...

429
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,557
...I had to change shifts at work...

430
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:46,394
...so you have to pick up Aunt May
tonight at 9:00. Understood?

431
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,355
- Is that understood?
- Yeah.

432
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,231
Okay, good.

433
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,693
She looks familiar.

434
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,697
The girl on your computer.

435
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:02,661
Yeah. He's got you on his computer.
I'm his probation officer.

436
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,080
Don't forget Aunt May.

437
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,585
Okay.

438
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:16,174
He's a character.

439
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,342
That's my uncle.

440
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:21,096
He's a pathological liar.
He thought you were someone else.

441
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,765
Oh, man, you don't have me
on your computer?

442
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:27,060
I took a photo of the debate team,
and you're in the debate team.

443
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:28,937
- Right.
- So...

444
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:31,439
...he must have seen...
I was touching up stuff.

445
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,775
- Touching up stuff?
- Come on.

446
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,611
I was... I'm not gonna answer that.

447
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,199
- Did you get expelled?
- No, no.

448
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:43,576
I didn't get expelled.
I got community service.

449
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:49,749
Um, so you want to... I don't know...?

450
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,167
Um...

451
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,335
Want to what?

452
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:54,003
I don't know.

453
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,880
Just, uh...

454
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,884
Um...

455
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,596
I don't know... We could...

456
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,558
We could do something else, or we could...

457
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,185
- if you don't feel like, we could...
- Yeah.

458
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,895
- Yeah?
- Yeah, either one.

459
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,023
- Really?
- Sure.

460
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,652
Okay. All right, good. Sounds good.

461
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:18,820
Cool.

462
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,822
Okay.

463
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,324
- I can't right now, I can't right now.
- Yeah, no.

464
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,660
- I'm so busy right now.
- I know, me too. Ugh.

465
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,832
But, uh, maybe, uh...

466
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:33,168
- Yeah, just, you know...
- Some other...

467
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,003
- Time, all right.
- Ha-ha-ha. Okay.

468
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,838
- Bye.
- All right.

491
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:03,007
Whoo!

492
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:07,470
We have protein structure, rDNA...

493
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,557
...chromatography, transgenics testing,
that's X-ray video.

494
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,142
That's the only one on the planet.
We have, um...

495
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,104
- Human line testing over...
- I remember that.

496
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:17,939
I've seen that before.

497
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:19,399
The Ganali device.

498
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:22,318
Yeah, I remember a picture
of that in my dad's office.

499
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,946
The idea was so simple.
You load it with an antigen.

500
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:28,575
It creates a cloud which can be dispersed
over a neighborhood, even a city.

501
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:32,120
Theoretically, you could cure
polio in an afternoon.

502
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,289
That's incredible.

503
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:37,709
Well, others disagreed.
What if the device were loaded with a toxin?

504
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:41,337
What if you wanted to opt out?
You can't run away from a cloud after all...

505
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,464
...so here it lies, gathering dust.

506
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,926
What you see here is
a computer model of a lizard.

507
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:50,305
Many of these wonderful creatures
have so brilliantly adapted...

508
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,974
...that they can regenerate
entire limbs at will.

509
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:54,976
You can imagine my envy.

510
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:59,480
We're trying to harness this capability
and transfer it into our host subject:

511
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,900
Freddy the three-legged mouse.

512
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,277
Enter the algorithm now.

513
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,365
Need to take that?

514
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,832
<i>System ready for gene insertion.</i>

515
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,626
Okay.

516
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:21,544
Check.

517
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,631
See what I'm trying to do?

518
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,674
- Pre-empt the proteins.
- The immune response.

519
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,009

532
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,707
And thank you.

533
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:04,337
Meet Fred and Wilma,
our three-legged mice.

534
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,466
Here you go.

535
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,970
Hey, buddy, I got you.

536
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,849
Okay. Careful, don't want
to stick you by mistake.

537
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,893
Human trials aren't until next week.

538
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:22,855
There.

539
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,823
Hey.

540
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,367
Hey, I thought you, uh...

541
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:37,620
- Didn't you forget something?
- What?

542
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:42,375
Now, don't answer that,
but I'm glad to know it's working.

543
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:47,338
You owe your aunt an apology big time.

544
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:52,218
Be a man. Get in there and apologize.

545
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:57,181
I'm sorry, Aunt May, I, uh...

546
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,393
Honestly, you don't have
to apologize to me. It's your...

547
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,353
- The hell he doesn't.
- Ben.

548
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,106
Look, I'm sorry, I got distracted.

549
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,191
- Oh, he got distracted.
- Yeah.

550
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,486
Your aunt, my wife,
had to walk 12 blocks alone...

551
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:14,115
...in the middle of the night and then
wait in a deserted subway station...

552
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:17,368
- ...because you got distracted.
- Ben, sweetheart, honestly...

553
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,579
...I am completely capable of walking home...

554
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:21,789
You will not defend this boy!

555
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,417
- I'm not defending...
- You are! Listen to me, son.

556
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:25,918
Yeah, go ahead.

557
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,628
You're a lot like your father.

558
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,298
You really are, Peter,
and that's a good thing...

559
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:33,593
...but your father lived by
a philosophy, a principle, really.

560
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,096
He believed that if you could do
good things for other people...

561
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,724
...you had a moral obligation to do those things.

562
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,476
That's what's at stake here.

563
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:42,643
Not choice.

564
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,812
Responsibility.

565
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,484
That is nice. That's great.

566
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,612
That's all well and good.
So where is he?

567
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,698
- What?
- Where is he?

568
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:57,825
Where's my dad?

569
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:01,496
He didn't think it was his responsibility
to be here to tell me himself?

570
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:02,997
Oh, come on, how dare you?

571
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:04,874
How dare I? How dare you?

572
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:10,505
Where you going?

573
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,465
Peter, come back here, please.

574
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:25,144
Ben, leave him alone for a little while.
He'll be all right.

575
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,158
Peter!

576
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,371
Peter?

577
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,378
Peter!

578
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,467
It's 2.07.

579
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:00,930
It's 2.07.

580
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:02,431
Yeah. No, I know.

581
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:05,434
Yeah, you're holding up the line. No.

582
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,895
You can leave a penny,
you can't take a penny.

583
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,273
- What?
- You can leave...

584
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:13,067
...a penny anytime,
you have to spend 10 dollars...

585
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:15,153
...to take a penny. It's store policy.

586
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,738
- You're holding up my line.
- I don't have 2 cents.

587
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,574
You can't afford milk, step aside.

588
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,993
Daddy didn't give you enough
milk money today?

589
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,494
We're talking about 2 cents.

590
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,704
Just step aside, kid.

591
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:32,628
Really?

592
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,393
Yo, not cool, bro.

593
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,272
Hey, man, stop!

594
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:52,899
Somebody stop that guy!

595
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,442
Hey, kid, little help?

596
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:55,985
Not my policy.

597
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:59,238
Somebody stop that dude! Hey!

598
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:00,740
Hey, stop!

599
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,826
- Somebody stop that dude!
- Oh!

600
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,211
Hey!

601
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:45,493
Oh, God, oh, God.

602
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,203
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

603
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,455
Call an ambulance!

604
00:45:49,622 --> 00:45:52,041
Someone call an ambulance!
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

605
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:54,335
Oh, God, oh, my God.

606
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,715
Oh, God.

607
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,470
No.

608
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,599
Oh, Jesus.

609
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,689
Witnesses gave a description
to the sketch artist.

610
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,524
I need you to take a look.

611
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,697
No, I don't know him.

612
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:25,449
I didn't expect you would, ma'am.

613
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:28,536
Homicide detectives are on it.
We'll see what they turn up.

614
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:30,371
Okay.

615
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,336
Can I have that?

616
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:38,879
Sure.

617
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,175
There's one other thing. He has a star...

618
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:45,511
<i>...tattooed on his left hand.</i>

619
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:17,501
<i>Peter, I know things
have been difficult lately...</i>

620
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,795
<i>...and I'm sorry about that.</i>

621
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:22,590
<i>I think I know what you're feeling.</i>

622
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:40,399
Hey, Parker.

623
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,527
- Not today.
- Come on, I just want to talk.

624
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:50,618
It feels better, right?

625
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,120
Look, your uncle died.

626
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:55,247
I'm sorry.

627
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:56,874
I get it.

628
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,834
I'm sorry.

629
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,795
Okay?

630
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:08,344
Peter.

631
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,013
- Unh. Get...
- Stay away from him.

632
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,181
- You understand?
- Hey!

633
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:55,766
- Stay away from Joey.
- Hey!

634
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,311
You like beating on girls?

635
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,021
You like beating on old men?

636
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,815
Hey, pal, keep walking.

637
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:05,401
- You're in the wrong place.
- When were you in Queens?

638
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,236
- Unh!
- I asked you a question.

639
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:08,737
- Nicky, no!
- That the gun?

640
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,448
- Unh!
- You gonna kill me too?

641
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,576
Hey! Stop it!

642
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:17,830
- Hey, get off!
- Wait, oh, don't hit Nicky!

643
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:22,001
- Back up!
- This guy is crazy!

644
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:23,878
Get him!

645
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,634
Get back here, man! Get him!

646
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,392
Follow him!

647
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,356
- Go around, man!
- I'll follow you!

648
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:53,991
Go, go, go!

649
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,285
There he is!

650
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:57,453
Can't get away!

651
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,763
<i>He has a star tattooed on his left hand.</i>

652
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,693
- Oh, yeah?
- Come on!

653
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,661
I know what you look like!

654
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,621
You hear me?

655
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,415
I've seen your face!

656
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,830
Is that all you got?

657
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,000
Just take it, take it.

658
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:34,174
<i>Engineered from genetically
enhanced spiders...</i>

659
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:38,762
<i>...Oscorp's BioCable tensile strength
is unparalleled. We're just beginning...</i>

660
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:42,683
<i>...to understand all the potential
industrial applications.</i>

661
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:46,353
<i>A single pellet can safely store
several hundred meters...</i>

662
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,355
<i>...of the lightweight cable.</i>

663
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,115
Aah! Mother...

664
00:52:55,631 --> 00:53:00,302
<i>Attention, all units in Precinct 13,
receiving a 10-30...</i>

665
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:02,763
<i>...on West 19th Street and Broadway.</i>

666
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:05,683
<i>Assailant is Caucasian male, mid-30s...</i>

667
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,769
<i>...170 to 180 pounds...</i>

668
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:10,312
<i>...shoulder-length blond hair.</i>

669
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:13,107
<i>Last seen on foot heading
eastbound on 19th Street.</i>

670
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,586
- Hey.
- Uhn!

671
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,803
You got a description?

672
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:45,973
- Well, no, he wears a mask.
- A mask?

673
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,307
Most of his victims...

674
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:50,853
...are suspects with serious rap sheets.
They're calling him a vigilante.

675
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,397
Okay, he's not a vigilante,
he's an anarchist.

676
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:56,191
Help me, somebody!
Arrest me!

677
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:57,484
Get me out of here.

678
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,237
Hey, look!

679
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,333
Spandex. Spandex.

680
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:15,127
Everything...

681
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:16,295
...spandex.

682
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:20,674
Extraordinary velocity vector is a function
of both mass and acceleration.

683
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:22,634
Aw, come on, you know
better than anyone...

684
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,262
...the weight on any pendulum
has no effect on speed.

685
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:29,183
It doesn't affect frequency,
but it's totally a factor in momentum.

686
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,012
Hey, Aunt May.

687
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,515
Yeah. Eggs?

688
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:10,849
Organic, got it.

689
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:45,676
Ahem. In the future,
if you're gonna steal cars...

690
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:47,803
...don't dress like a car thief, man.

691
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:49,513
What are you? You a cop?

692
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:54,601
Really? You seriously think I'm a cop?
Cop in a skin-tight red-and-blue suit?

693
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,270
You know, you're...

694
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,438
You've got a mind...

695
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:00,065
...of the true scholar, sir.

696
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:02,609
I was going more for the guys
who do the luge.

697
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,278
Good thinking.

698
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:05,988
Get out the window.

699
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:08,907
There you go. You got it.
Whoa.

700
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:17,291
Crotch!

701
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:22,462
- Just let me go.
- Is that a real knife?

702
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:25,465
- Yes, it's a real knife.
- My weakness, it's small knives.

703
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:29,303
- Just let me go.
- Anything but knives! Oh, it's so simple.

704
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,929
- That was cool.
- What is this?

705
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:33,682
Webbing I developed.
I don't think you want to know.

706
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:34,850
Let me go!

707
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:39,438
- Okay, one second. Hold on, one second.
- Knock it off, man. No!

708
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:42,983
- Achoo!
- Come on, let me go. Stop it!

709
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:44,860
- Ha-ha-ha.
- That isn't funny.

710
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:46,486
- It is kind of funny.
- Help!

711
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:47,696
Shh.

712
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:58,832
Ooh. This could've gone a lot worse.

713
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,959
Now hold still.

714
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,841
Oh! Boys in blue here.

715
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:10,510
- Yo, I got him.
- Freeze!

716
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:12,512
- He's not going anywhere.
- Don't move.

717
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:13,680
You serious?

718
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,015
Who are you?

719
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:18,310
- No one grasps the concept of the mask.
- Freeze!

720
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:25,150
I just did 80 percent of your job. Huh?
And that? That's how you repay me?

721
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:30,030
Hold it right there!

722
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:50,425
Woo-hoo!

723
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:51,927
Well, that was fun.

724
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:55,013
Bus! Hey there, everybody.

725
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:00,102
What are you doing?

726
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:04,523
Whoo!

727
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:05,774
Hey, watch out.

728
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:07,067
I'm swinging here.

729
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:08,735
I'm swinging here.

730
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:18,912
Woo-hoo!

731
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:29,965
So 38 of New York's finest
versus one guy in a unitard.

732
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,092
Am I correct?

733
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:47,649
You don't have to wait up for me.

734
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:49,109
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

735
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:50,277
Yes, I do.

736
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:51,778
- Okay.
- Where were you?

737
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:52,988
I was out.

738
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:55,115
Did you get the eggs?

739
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:58,160
Nope. Forgot the eggs.

740
00:58:58,326 --> 00:58:59,536
I'm gonna get them now.

741
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:01,288
No, you most certainly will not.

742
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:03,457
Not at this hour.

743
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:07,169
Look at me, Peter.

744
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,506
Take off the damn hood and look at me.

745
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:22,309
Peter. Where do you go?

746
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:23,935
Who does this to you?

747
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,896
Please go to sleep, Aunt May.

748
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:28,065
- Please tell me.
- Aunt May, please...

749
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,275
...please, please go to sleep.

750
00:59:30,442 --> 00:59:33,487
I can't sleep. Don't you understand?
I can't sleep.

751
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:47,501
Peter, listen to me.

752
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:49,419
Secrets have a cost.

753
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,129
They're not for free.

754
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:53,507
Not now, not ever.

755
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,725
Cross-species genetics is finally working.

756
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:06,686
I've used the lizard DNA to help
Freddy regrow that limb.

757
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,438
It's a miracle.

758
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,190
No, it's hard work and promise.

759
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:14,277
- It's a step closer to the primate lab.
- He doesn't have time for every little step.

760
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:17,072
- Little?
- I just mean he can't wait.

761
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:18,907
Well, he'll have to.

762
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:20,992
Unless he wants to be a lab rat.

763
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:23,036
That's not what I'm saying.

764
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:24,996
So, what are you saying?

765
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:27,332
You have to start human trials.

766
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:31,128
- Now.
- No, I don't, and no, I won't.

767
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:33,255
- Well, then he's going to die.
- People die.

768
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:36,466
Even Norman Osborn.

769
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:37,634
We are not finished.

770
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:39,386
Human trials?

771
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:42,139
Where are you going to find
the people to volunteer?

772
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,891
As far as anyone's concerned,
it's for a flu shot.

773
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,936
I might think the Veterans Hospital
is a place to start.

774
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:49,437
You've gotta be kidding me.

775
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:51,648
I don't think I am.

776
01:00:58,113 --> 01:01:01,700
It's a little late for shock and indignation.
About 15 years late.

777
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,743
I have no idea what you're talking about.

778
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,412
Richard Parker wore it well.

779
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:08,415
On you, it's a cheap suit,
as it was then.

780
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:10,041
I had nothing to do with that.

781
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,751
Is that what you told his son?

782
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:19,843
- I don't know what you're saying.
- You don't know...

783
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:21,428
...or you don't wanna know?

784
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,265
I'll remind you what happened.

785
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:28,894
Richard Parker said just about the same
thing then that you are saying now.

786
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:34,441
The clock is ticking, Dr Connors.

787
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:37,194
I, um...

788
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:46,453
I won't.

789
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:50,290
Fine.

790
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:57,589
The formula is ours now anyway.

791
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:01,551
Say goodbye to that arm
you have dreamed of.

792
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,261
I'm shutting you down.

793
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:06,348
Have your office cleared out
by the morning.

794
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:10,018
Your toys can be taken
away too, you know.

795
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:13,230
Right, Freddy?

796
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:29,496
- Hey.
- Hi.

797
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:31,706
- How's it going?
- Where you headed?

798
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:35,377
- Uh... Monday, B track.
- Oh, it's Thursday.

799
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:37,504
- It's Thursday?
- What happened?

800
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:39,339
- What?
- Your eye, it looks bruised.

801
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:40,757
Oh, yeah, no, I don't...

802
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:42,550
Maybe I got a rash or...

803
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,511
It's bad. Have you gone to the nurse?

804
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:46,304
Mm-hm.

805
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,473
Do you like branzino?

806
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:50,850
Like, a fish.

807
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:52,852
Mm-hm. No, no. I know. I know.

808
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,230
Well, if you want...

809
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:59,901
...you can come to this
address at 8:00 tonight.

810
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:02,362
My mom's making branzino.

811
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,281
So...

812
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:07,826
It's apartment 2016.
I didn't write that part down.

813
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:09,327
I don't know why I... Heh.

814
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:11,329
- I'll remember it.
- Oh, okay.

815
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:12,539
2016.

816
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,443
Hi. Heh.

817
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:24,861
How did you get out there?

818
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:27,280
The fire escape.

819
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:29,949
Your doorman's intimidating.

820
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,494
It's 20 storeys.

821
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,287
Yeah. It's all right.

822
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:40,460
- This is your room.
- Yes, this is my room.

823
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:42,295
Books.

824
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:44,798
- Shoes.
- Ha-ha-ha.

825
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:46,091
Oh, hey, uh...

826
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:48,510
I got your mom, um...

827
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:50,053
...these.

828
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:51,304
Oh, lovely.

829
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:53,139
- Beautiful, right?
- Beautiful.

830
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:54,682
They were nice.

831
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:56,643
- No, they're beautiful.
- I'm sorry.

832
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:59,562
No, it's impressive.
They actually held together very well.

833
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,272
- I'm gonna keep these.
- Heh.

834
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:03,483
You have your suit in there?

835
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:08,196
My suit?

836
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:10,740
It's for dinner. Are you gonna...?

837
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,033
Are you gonna wear that?

838
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,494
- That's, um...
- Hey, hon.

839
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:21,751
- You must be Peter.
- Dad, this is Peter.

840
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:25,630
Nice to meet you, sir.

841
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:27,966
Nice to meet you.

842
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:29,717
Dinner's ready.

843
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:31,845
Hope you like branzino.

844
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:33,555
Who doesn't?

845
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:34,407
<i>Emma, it's Curt.</i>

846
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:37,368
- Is he there?
- <i>I'm afraid not, doctor.</i>

847
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:40,371
<i>The car is taking him to the
Veterans Hospital in Brooklyn.</i>

848
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:41,748
No. He can't, Emma.

849
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:44,209
You have to stop him. He...

850
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:47,086
<i>I would, but I always
lose him on the bridge.</i>

851
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:50,131
<i>I'll make sure Dr Ratha returns
your call as soon as possible.</i>

852
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:03,269
I'm going to Holton Avenue,
across the river. I'm in a hurry.

853
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,480
You want me to take
the tunnel or the bridge?

854
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:06,898
Bridge! Take the bridge.

855
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:08,399
All right, we'll do that.

856
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:10,485
Hey, you all right back there?

857
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:13,530
- Unh!
- You tweaking, man?

858
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:16,282
Just drive.

859
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,076
Okay.

860
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:27,669
You're having trouble there?
The head goes on the other...

861
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:29,379
Help Gwen's friend with his fish.

862
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:30,755
Oh, I...

863
01:07:30,922 --> 01:07:32,006
I got no idea.

864
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:33,716
First time.

865
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,426
- Branzino.
- George.

866
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:38,388
- Tell us about your day.
- Did you catch that spider guy yet?

867
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:42,183
No, we didn't catch him yet. But we will.
He's an amateur...

868
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:45,061
...who's assaulting civilians
in the dead of night.

869
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:47,105
He's clumsy, he leaves clues...

870
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:48,648
...but he's still dangerous.

871
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:50,984
He's assaulting people?

872
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:53,820
I'm not sure.

873
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:55,446
I mean, I saw that video...

874
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:57,574
...with him and the car thief, and...

875
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:00,868
I think most people
would say that he was...

876
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:02,996
...providing a public service.

877
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:05,665
Most people would be wrong.

878
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:10,420
If I wanted the car thief off the street,
he'd already be off the street.

879
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:11,838
So why wasn't he then?

880
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:16,884
Let me illuminate you.

881
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:19,679
The car thief was leading us
to the people who run...

882
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:22,056
...the operation.
It's a six-month-long sting.

883
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:25,226
It's called strategy.
I'm sure you're aware of the term?

884
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:27,895
- You've heard about that in school?
- Yeah.

885
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:30,356
- Good.
- <i>I know.</i>

886
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:33,192
- He didn't know you had a plan.
- You seem to know...

887
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,111
...a lot about this.
Know something we don't?

888
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:37,572
- Whose side are you on?
- I'm not on anyone's side.

889
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:40,825
- I saw a video on the Internet...
- Oh. You saw the video on the Internet.

890
01:08:40,992 --> 01:08:43,202
- Well, then the case is closed.
- Well, no.

891
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,955
If you watch the video...
Maybe send you a link?

892
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,790
It looks like he's trying to help.

893
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,835
On the Internet he's being
made out to look like a hero.

894
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:53,546
No, no. I'm not saying he's a hero.

895
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:56,049
- What are you trying to say?
- He's trying to help.

896
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:57,550
He's trying to do something
the police can't.

897
01:08:57,717 --> 01:08:59,093
Something the police can't?

898
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,803
- I don't know.
- What do you think we do?

899
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:04,474
Sit around eating doughnuts
with our thumbs planted up our asses?

900
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:06,684
- George. George.
- Daddy.

901
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:08,102
- Up your what?
- Howard.

902
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:11,314
He stands for what you stand for.
Protecting innocent people from bad guys.

903
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:13,566
I stand for law and order.
That's what I stand for.

904
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:15,318
Okay? I wear a badge.

905
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:18,529
This guy wears a mask like an outlaw.

906
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:21,240
He's hunting down criminals
that all look the same...

907
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:23,576
...like he's got some sort
of personal vendetta.

908
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:26,746
But he's not protecting
innocent people, Mr Parker.

909
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:28,748
Let's get some air, Peter.

910
01:09:29,374 --> 01:09:32,210
- Dad, we need to talk.
- Yes, we do.

911
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,755
Thank you for having me. I'm sorry...

912
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:38,174
...if I insulted you.
It was not my intention.

913
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:41,678
- You're welcome.
- Branzino was real good, Mrs Stacy.

914
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:43,930
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

915
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,184
- Dad.
- Yeah?

916
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:56,859
Well, that was something.

917
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:01,406
I'm sorry. I thought he was going
to arrest me at one point.

918
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:04,200
No, I wouldn't have let him arrest you.

919
01:10:08,955 --> 01:10:10,873
- What happened to your face?
- I wanna tell you something.

920
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,042
Oh. Heh.

921
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:14,794
Okay.

922
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:21,217
I've been bitten...

923
01:10:25,513 --> 01:10:26,514
So have I.

924
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:33,312
Okay.

925
01:10:34,814 --> 01:10:37,316
Okay, okay, okay.
I gotta tell you this one thing.

926
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:40,695
I gotta tell you this one thing about
the vigilante and the car thief.

927
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:44,073
- Oh, okay.
- What?

928
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,492
- No, no, no.
- I don't want to talk about that.

929
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,327
Forget that.
I won't talk about that.

930
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:50,747
- I'm gonna talk about me, okay?
- What about you?

931
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:54,751
It's impo... I wish I could just...

932
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,169
I can't. It's hard to say.

933
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:57,336
Just say it.

934
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:59,630
- I don't know.
- Say it.

935
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:03,760
What? What?

936
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:08,931
What?

937
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:14,854
Okay, then forget it.

938
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:24,447
You...?

939
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:26,324
Shh, shh.

940
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,208
- You're Spider-Man.
- Shut up.

941
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:41,714
Gwen?

942
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:45,176
Gwen... Uh...

943
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:47,261
Your father wants you to come inside.

944
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:48,888
Okay.

945
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:50,056
- Okay?
- Yeah.

946
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:53,893
Gwen.

947
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:55,728
I'm coming.

948
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:28,845
Oh, I'm in trouble.

949
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:55,454
Will you please find out
what is going on, Alfred?

950
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:02,753
Oh...

951
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:03,921
Excellent.

952
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:07,967
Hey!

953
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:12,179
Hey! What is that?

954
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:14,223
- Oh, my God!
- I don't know!

955
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:15,808
Get back in the car!

956
01:13:20,897 --> 01:13:22,273
Help!

957
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:24,859
Help!

958
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:07,151
Incoming!

959
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:29,173
Somebody help!

960
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:31,384
Help me! My kid is trapped!

961
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:42,311
I want my dad!

962
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:43,688
Dad!

963
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:45,231
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Help!

964
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:47,400
- Hey, buddy. It's okay.
- Get away.

965
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:49,485
- Aah. Help!
- Hey, look.

966
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:52,905
Just a normal guy, all right?

967
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:55,616
Wanna hold this?

968
01:14:57,201 --> 01:14:58,202
Hold my mask.

969
01:14:58,619 --> 01:14:59,620
All right.

970
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,540
What's your name?

971
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:03,708
Jack?

972
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:06,085
- Yes.
- Let's get you out of here.

973
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:09,213
Okay, stay very still.

974
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:11,632
- All right.
- Okay, I got you.

975
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:18,514
Okay, look.
I'll undo the belt. You hold on...

976
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:20,725
...to that seat in front of you.
On three?

977
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:23,644
- All right.
- Okay, one, two, three.

978
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:27,940
See how easy that was?
You did a great job.

979
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:29,817
All right, okay.

980
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:39,118
- Aah!
- Uhn!

981
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:44,790
Jack, climb now.

982
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:46,584
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

983
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:53,966
Put it on, the mask.

984
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:55,551
It's gonna make you strong.

985
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:57,470
Jack, trust me.

986
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:58,637
Put it on.

987
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:02,016
There you go. That's it.
That's it, buddy.

988
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:03,309
Okay, now, climb.

989
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:04,477
Come on, Jack.

990
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:10,566
Do me a favor.
A little faster, okay, bud?

991
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:13,152
You're doing great, buddy.
You're doing great.

992
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:14,403
That's it. Keep coming.

993
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:15,988
Keep it coming.

994
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:17,198
Keep coming.

995
01:16:18,115 --> 01:16:19,450
- No!
- Aah!

996
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,800
Jack. Oh, God.

997
01:16:35,966 --> 01:16:37,468
Thank God.

998
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:40,513
You okay?

999
01:16:43,557 --> 01:16:45,017
My son. My son.

1000
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:46,977
Oh, my son.

1001
01:16:47,144 --> 01:16:48,896
My son.

1002
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,443
Who are you?

1003
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:58,364
Spider-Man.

1004
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:47,413
Beautiful.

1005
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:57,464
Settle down, guys.

1006
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,258
Settle down, boys. Settle down.

1007
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:00,759
- Come on.
- Listen.

1008
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:02,636
At approximately 9 p.m. last night...

1009
01:18:02,803 --> 01:18:05,222
...an incident took place
on the Williamsburg Bridge.

1010
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:08,517
<i>Much of what occurred
is speculation at this point.</i>

1011
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:10,561
<i>However, several eyewitnesses...</i>

1012
01:18:10,728 --> 01:18:14,148
<i>...to the crime, as well
as our own preliminary findings...</i>

1013
01:18:14,315 --> 01:18:17,276
<i>...have positively placed
one individual at the scene.</i>

1014
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:20,487
<i>Which is why, this morning
I am issuing a warrant...</i>

1015
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:23,991
<i>...for the masked vigilante
known as Spider-Man.</i>

1016
01:18:29,914 --> 01:18:31,832
<i>And lastly, city council members...</i>

1017
01:18:31,999 --> 01:18:35,461
<i>...met with homeowners and airport
officials in the first of four meetings...</i>

1018
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,136
It's so beautiful.

1019
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:46,138
Knows how to bite though.

1020
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:48,057
Who else knows about this?

1021
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:50,517
- Just you.
- Really?

1022
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:54,897
Hey, you don't...

1023
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:58,234
You don't believe what the police
are saying, do you?

1024
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:00,611
Of course not.

1025
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,989
Does it scare you?

1026
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:05,991
What you can do?

1027
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:09,828
No.

1028
01:19:10,955 --> 01:19:12,039
No.

1029
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,125
What did that thing on the bridge look like?

1030
01:19:15,668 --> 01:19:18,128
It was real big.
Too big to be human.

1031
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:20,047
You gotta lay low.

1032
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:22,216
No, can't do that.

1033
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:23,968
You've got to.

1034
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:26,303
I mean, why...?

1035
01:19:26,637 --> 01:19:29,098
Because of last night.

1036
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:31,267
Those people on the bridge.

1037
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:35,437
Whatever was attacking them
would have killed them.

1038
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:39,608
So I gotta go after it.

1039
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:42,152
That's not your job.

1040
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:45,155
Maybe it is.

1041
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:51,620
I really liked kissing you.

1042
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:55,749
You're an amazing kisser.

1043
01:19:58,544 --> 01:19:59,712
Well, you know, it was...

1044
01:19:59,878 --> 01:20:01,880
It was good for me too.

1045
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:06,176
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

1046
01:20:14,393 --> 01:20:15,394
Yo!

1047
01:20:15,602 --> 01:20:16,729
Who did that?

1048
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:39,460
Hello!

1049
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:51,305
It's not nice to snoop.

1050
01:20:54,224 --> 01:20:56,101
I gave everyone the week off.

1051
01:20:58,354 --> 01:20:59,355
Yeah.

1052
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:01,607
Shouldn't you be at school?

1053
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:05,402
No, I got a free track.

1054
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:07,571
I wanted to ask you a question.

1055
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,783
How would a predator track a reptile?

1056
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:13,786
Oh, they don't.
Most reptiles are at the top...

1057
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:15,204
...of their food chain.

1058
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:16,872
Kings of their domain.

1059
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:18,540
They gotta have vulnerabilities.

1060
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:21,293
Why the sudden interest
in the cold-blooded?

1061
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:26,090
Just asking a question.

1062
01:21:26,256 --> 01:21:29,093
I got school stuff.

1063
01:21:29,259 --> 01:21:31,261
Biology profiles to do.

1064
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:33,972
- Mm.
- So because of the cold blood...

1065
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:36,016
...would they react
to changes in temperatures?

1066
01:21:36,183 --> 01:21:37,559
You'd have to catch one first.

1067
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:41,772
Did you know there's a rumor
of a new species in New York?

1068
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:43,440
Beautiful and quite large.

1069
01:21:44,608 --> 01:21:46,568
What do you know about it?
You seen it?

1070
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:48,737
No, it's not yet classified.

1071
01:21:51,698 --> 01:21:53,700
But it can be aggressive...

1072
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:55,661
...if threatened.

1073
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:04,545
Doc, you all right?

1074
01:22:04,711 --> 01:22:07,339
Never been better, Peter.
Never been better.

1075
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:09,049
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1076
01:22:09,216 --> 01:22:11,969
Afraid I have to ask you to leave.
I have a new project...

1077
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:14,555
...I'm working on. I need to be alone.

1078
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:17,474
Good. Good, good.

1079
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:19,852
Good.

1080
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:23,147
Don't worry, Mr Parker. I'll be back.

1081
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,483
Wonderful things are coming.

1082
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:29,528
Wonderful things.

1083
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:45,377
Fred?

1084
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:52,384
Mr Mayor, if there was a giant dinosaur...

1085
01:22:52,551 --> 01:22:55,053
...running around you
would be the first to know.

1086
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:57,764
So tell your son he can
rest easy, all right?

1087
01:22:57,931 --> 01:22:59,975
Yeah. You and me both, sir.

1088
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:02,352
Okay. Bye-bye.

1089
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:04,396
Mr Parker, why are you...

1090
01:23:04,563 --> 01:23:06,398
- ...not in school?
- Got a free track.

1091
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:07,816
Okay, well, I do not.

1092
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:09,234
So make your point quickly.

1093
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:11,778
Fine, there may not be
a dinosaur running around.

1094
01:23:11,945 --> 01:23:14,239
There is something more
dangerous, and I know who.

1095
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:15,991
- You know who?
- Dr Curtis Connors.

1096
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:17,534
- He's a biochemist.
- Of Oscorp?

1097
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:19,203
- That's right.
- Dr Connors...

1098
01:23:19,369 --> 01:23:21,371
...who's my daughter's mentor.
Is that who?

1099
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:22,748
- That's the one.
- Okay.

1100
01:23:22,915 --> 01:23:26,210
Recently, Dr Connors gave Gwen
a college recommendation.

1101
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:28,420
It was beautiful.
When I read it, I cried.

1102
01:23:28,587 --> 01:23:29,963
You would have me believe...

1103
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:33,133
...that he is running around
dressed up like a dinosaur?

1104
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:36,970
Not dressing up and not a dinosaur.
He has transformed himself into a lizard.

1105
01:23:40,224 --> 01:23:41,767
Let me ask you a question.

1106
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:45,062
Do I look like the mayor
of Tokyo to you?

1107
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:47,689
I'm telling you the absolute truth.

1108
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:50,901
This man has worked for his whole
life on cross-species genetics.

1109
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:54,613
He lost an arm, he tried to grow it back,
but the equation was imbalanced.

1110
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:57,241
He has turned into a lizard.
He's using lizard DNA.

1111
01:23:57,407 --> 01:24:01,119
He is dangerous, and he is planning
something horrific. I know. I know.

1112
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:03,747
Okay. All right, I get it.

1113
01:24:04,623 --> 01:24:05,666
Here's what we'll do.

1114
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:08,919
You'll go back to hanging out
with the citizens of Tokyo.

1115
01:24:09,086 --> 01:24:13,507
I'm gonna go back to protecting the citizens
of this fine, fair city of ours.

1116
01:24:13,674 --> 01:24:15,926
Sergeant Butler, please escort Mr Parker...

1117
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:17,511
- ...back to school.
- Captain Stacy...

1118
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:19,054
I'm not messing around.

1119
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:22,266
Just bring him in. Just call him in.
You have to call him in.

1120
01:24:22,432 --> 01:24:24,059
He is a danger to everybody.

1121
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:26,478
- Just, please, listen to me.
- Let's go.

1122
01:24:30,816 --> 01:24:32,568
- Jimmy.
- Mm?

1123
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,238
Get me everything we have
on Dr Curtis Connors.

1124
01:24:36,405 --> 01:24:38,740
- Okay? Right away.
- Yeah.

1125
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:06,310
Subject: Dr Curtis Connors.

1126
01:25:06,476 --> 01:25:08,020
Current temperature: 89.7.

1127
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:09,646
Steady for 48 hours.

1128
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:12,316
Blood panels reveal lymphocyte
and monocyte readings...

1129
01:25:12,482 --> 01:25:14,151
...consistent with subject's past.

1130
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:21,575
Clotting rate vastly improved.

1131
01:25:21,742 --> 01:25:23,243
Marked enhancement...

1132
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:24,745
...in muscle response...

1133
01:25:24,911 --> 01:25:26,288
...strength and elasticity.

1134
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:36,214
Eyesight similarly improved.

1135
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:38,884
Subject no longer requires
corrective lenses.

1136
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:46,141
This is no longer about curing ills.

1137
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:49,311
This is about finding perfection.

1138
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:00,656
In attempt to redress regenerative relapse...

1139
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:04,576
...dosage has been increased to 200 milligrams.

1140
01:27:39,379 --> 01:27:41,131
You stopped me once.

1141
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:44,342
You won't stop me again.

1142
01:27:46,344 --> 01:27:49,347
I'm getting stronger every day!

1143
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:29,638
Oh, that sucked.

1144
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:42,734
Peter Parker.

1145
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:01,962
Come in.

1146
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:05,757
You should maybe, uh...

1147
01:29:05,924 --> 01:29:07,759
...consider coming in through the lobby.

1148
01:29:09,386 --> 01:29:12,430
Also, my father is under the impression...

1149
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:15,433
- ...that you require psychiatric attention.
- Oh, really?

1150
01:29:15,684 --> 01:29:17,269
Peter.

1151
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:18,812
What happened?

1152
01:29:18,979 --> 01:29:20,313
You should see the other guy.

1153
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:26,570
The other guy, in this instance,
being a giant mutant lizard.

1154
01:29:26,736 --> 01:29:27,737
Hey, Gwen, honey.

1155
01:29:27,904 --> 01:29:30,115
Do you want cocoa?
Howard's making some.

1156
01:29:30,282 --> 01:29:31,867
Shh.

1157
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:36,121
No, Dad, I do not want cocoa.

1158
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:38,957
- Honestly, I'm 17 years old.
- Okay.

1159
01:29:39,124 --> 01:29:43,169
I remembered somebody saying her fantasy
was to live in a chocolate house.

1160
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:44,796
Well, that's impractical.

1161
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:46,381
And fattening.

1162
01:29:49,634 --> 01:29:50,719
Chocolate house.

1163
01:29:53,597 --> 01:29:55,390
- Sorry, Dad.
- It's good.

1164
01:29:55,557 --> 01:29:58,351
I can't have cocoa right now
because I'm work...

1165
01:29:58,518 --> 01:30:01,605
I'm doing this, um...

1166
01:30:01,771 --> 01:30:03,398
I have cramps.

1167
01:30:03,732 --> 01:30:06,318
- Oh.
- I feel kind of pukey and just sort of...

1168
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:08,778
- Like, emotional. I keep crying.
- It's okay. Good.

1169
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:10,655
- Good.
- It's brutal.

1170
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:12,866
You don't want to know.

1171
01:30:13,033 --> 01:30:14,200
- It's, like, bad.
- Got it.

1172
01:30:14,367 --> 01:30:16,328
- Thanks, Daddy.
- All right.

1173
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:43,855
Easy, Bug Boy.

1174
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:46,066
What'd you call me?

1175
01:30:51,112 --> 01:30:52,948
I'm going to be all right.

1176
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:55,825
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes.

1177
01:30:57,202 --> 01:30:59,704
I know what this is.

1178
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:01,206
What is it?

1179
01:31:02,165 --> 01:31:05,293
Every day, for as long as I can
remember, my father...

1180
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,920
...has left every morning...

1181
01:31:07,087 --> 01:31:09,756
...and he's put a badge on his chest...

1182
01:31:09,923 --> 01:31:12,217
...and strapped a gun to his hip.

1183
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:17,263
And every day,
for as long as I can remember...

1184
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:19,891
...I haven't known if he was
gonna make it home.

1185
01:31:29,442 --> 01:31:31,277
I got you.

1186
01:31:32,529 --> 01:31:33,697
Okay?

1187
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:37,409
Okay?

1188
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:41,079
I gotta stop him, though.

1189
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:44,666
I have to, because I created him.

1190
01:31:47,961 --> 01:31:49,421
What do you mean?

1191
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:53,133
I gave him an equation...

1192
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:57,595
...that made all of this possible.

1193
01:32:05,228 --> 01:32:08,106
Something my father had been
working on, you know.

1194
01:32:08,273 --> 01:32:11,276
Secretly. Now I realize
why he kept it a secret.

1195
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:16,531
Point is, this is my responsibility.

1196
01:32:19,868 --> 01:32:22,037
I have to fix it.

1197
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:26,791
Peter.

1198
01:32:27,834 --> 01:32:29,544
Hey.

1199
01:32:32,839 --> 01:32:34,966
Let's get out of here.

1200
01:32:35,133 --> 01:32:36,926
Let's just get out of here.

1201
01:32:37,093 --> 01:32:38,803
Just for a minute. Can we?

1202
01:32:39,512 --> 01:32:41,473
- No. No.
- Yeah. Yes.

1203
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:42,807
- Yes.
- No.

1204
01:32:42,974 --> 01:32:44,142
Yes.

1205
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:46,811
If my parents see me leaving, I'm dead.

1206
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:53,485
Your parents aren't
gonna see you leaving.

1207
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:08,458
<i>Peter Parker.</i>

1208
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:10,293
<i>Spider-Man.</i>

1209
01:33:10,668 --> 01:33:13,880
<i>I'm not the one who needs help.</i>

1210
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:15,757
<i>There will be no more loneliness...</i>

1211
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:17,383
<i>...no more outcasts.</i>

1212
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:21,304
<i>Species-wide distribution could enhance...</i>

1213
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:23,848
<i>...humanity on an evolutionary scale.</i>

1214
01:33:24,307 --> 01:33:26,643
<i>One has to adapt to survive.</i>

1215
01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:32,732
"That, changing like the snake,
I might be free...

1216
01:33:32,899 --> 01:33:36,528
...to cast off flesh wherein I dwell confined."

1217
01:33:36,694 --> 01:33:39,864
<i>Would you give it all up
after all you know...</i>

1218
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:43,785
<i>...you can do? All the power you feel.</i>

1219
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:49,707
<i>I can save them!</i>

1220
01:33:56,339 --> 01:33:58,675
<i>You won't get in the way of my plan...</i>

1221
01:33:58,842 --> 01:34:00,468
<i>...Peter Parker!</i>

1222
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:28,121
Go. Go!

1223
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:06,492
Nowhere to hide, Peter.

1224
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:26,471
All these souls, lost and alone.

1225
01:35:26,638 --> 01:35:29,307
I can save them. I can cure them.

1226
01:35:29,474 --> 01:35:32,227
There's no need to stop me, Peter.

1227
01:35:41,694 --> 01:35:43,780
You're not thinking straight, doc.

1228
01:35:47,492 --> 01:35:49,118
Stop this. This isn't you.

1229
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:55,291
Let's talk this out.

1230
01:35:56,376 --> 01:35:57,377
Doc!

1231
01:36:03,216 --> 01:36:04,259
Oh, boy.

1232
01:36:09,847 --> 01:36:10,890
You don't want to talk?

1233
01:36:12,267 --> 01:36:13,268
There you go.

1234
01:36:16,854 --> 01:36:18,147
Don't... Uhn!

1235
01:36:18,314 --> 01:36:20,275
...make me...

1236
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:21,651
...have to...

1237
01:36:22,151 --> 01:36:23,152
...hurt you!

1238
01:36:30,994 --> 01:36:32,328
That is disgusting.

1239
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:43,756
Gwen.

1240
01:37:07,697 --> 01:37:09,907
- I'm gonna throw you out the window.
- What?

1241
01:37:21,711 --> 01:37:22,962
Uh-oh.

1242
01:37:23,129 --> 01:37:26,007
Somebody's been a bad lizard.

1243
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:16,557
This is Lieutenant Williams from
the New York City Police Department.

1244
01:38:16,724 --> 01:38:18,601
We've got this building surrounded.

1245
01:38:27,777 --> 01:38:29,570
Alpha, let's move ahead. Go!

1246
01:38:41,416 --> 01:38:42,708
- Hey.
- <i>Where are you?</i>

1247
01:38:42,875 --> 01:38:45,211
I'm fine. I'm okay.
I'm in the sewer, tracking him.

1248
01:38:45,378 --> 01:38:47,338
I gotta stop him before anyone gets hurt.

1249
01:38:47,505 --> 01:38:48,631
But we need an antidote.

1250
01:38:48,798 --> 01:38:51,384
- Do you know how to run a serum?
- <i>I do it all the time.</i>

1251
01:38:51,551 --> 01:38:53,970
Okay, great.
Okay, I need you to go to Oscorp.

1252
01:38:54,137 --> 01:38:57,140
<i>I need you to access the cross-species file.
It's a blue serum.</i>

1253
01:38:57,306 --> 01:38:59,434
File 12389.

1254
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:00,685
<i>Okay, got it.</i>

1255
01:39:00,852 --> 01:39:02,603
On my way.

1256
01:39:34,093 --> 01:39:37,722
<i>I spent my life as a scientist trying
to create a world without weakness...</i>

1257
01:39:37,889 --> 01:39:40,057
<i>...without outcasts.</i>

1258
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:42,768
<i>I sought to create
a stronger human being...</i>

1259
01:39:42,935 --> 01:39:44,854
<i>...but there's no such thing.</i>

1260
01:39:45,021 --> 01:39:50,109
<i>Human beings are weak, pathetic,
feeble-minded creatures.</i>

1261
01:39:50,276 --> 01:39:54,155
<i>Why be human at all when
we can be so much more?</i>

1262
01:39:54,322 --> 01:39:56,616
<i>Faster. Stronger.</i>

1263
01:39:56,782 --> 01:39:58,201
<i>Smarter.</i>

1264
01:39:58,367 --> 01:40:01,204
<i>This is my gift to you.</i>

1265
01:40:09,712 --> 01:40:11,380
Oscorp.

1266
01:40:13,633 --> 01:40:14,759
- Captain Stacy!
- What?

1267
01:40:14,926 --> 01:40:18,638
We have a confirmed sighting, sir.
The Lizard's headed toward Canal Street.

1268
01:40:18,804 --> 01:40:21,140
- What about Spider-Man?
- Inside the high school.

1269
01:40:21,307 --> 01:40:23,226
I want that Spider-Man off the street.

1270
01:42:10,207 --> 01:42:12,710
<i>The lizard creature has
released a biological agent.</i>

1271
01:42:12,877 --> 01:42:14,670
<i>All efforts to stop him have failed...</i>

1272
01:42:14,837 --> 01:42:18,049
<i>...and he is now proceeding
north on 7th Avenue. Over.</i>

1273
01:42:22,303 --> 01:42:23,429
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Where are you?

1274
01:42:23,596 --> 01:42:26,307
- <i>Peter, hi. I'm at Oscorp.</i>
- You have to get out of there now.

1275
01:42:26,474 --> 01:42:28,851
- The antidote is cooking.
- <i>No, no, no.</i>

1276
01:42:29,018 --> 01:42:31,479
<i>Connors is on the way.
He's coming to you right now.</i>

1277
01:42:31,646 --> 01:42:34,190
He needs the device.
He's gonna infect the whole city!

1278
01:42:34,357 --> 01:42:35,524
Eight minutes left.

1279
01:42:35,691 --> 01:42:38,235
<i>You're gonna wait eight minutes
after what I told you?</i>

1280
01:42:38,402 --> 01:42:39,737
You leave right now.

1281
01:42:39,904 --> 01:42:40,946
<i>That is an order, okay?</i>

1282
01:42:41,113 --> 01:42:42,198
I'll get everybody out.

1283
01:42:42,365 --> 01:42:43,866
<i>Did you hear wh...?</i>

1284
01:42:44,033 --> 01:42:47,078
Gwen! Gwen!
You Mother Hubbard. Are you serious?

1285
01:43:03,594 --> 01:43:04,762
He's heading south.

1286
01:43:15,523 --> 01:43:17,525
Stand down now, or we will open fire.

1287
01:43:17,692 --> 01:43:20,945
You are surrounded.
There is no escape.

1288
01:43:21,404 --> 01:43:22,822
Go, go!

1289
01:44:24,759 --> 01:44:26,135
Clear!

1290
01:44:26,302 --> 01:44:27,428
Clear up top!

1291
01:44:29,263 --> 01:44:31,849
- Clear, sir!
- All clear here, sir!

1292
01:44:57,333 --> 01:44:58,876
Freeze!

1293
01:44:59,543 --> 01:45:00,711
Down on the ground.

1294
01:45:00,878 --> 01:45:02,338
Your hands behind your head.

1295
01:45:02,505 --> 01:45:04,131
Now!

1296
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:08,969
Parker.

1297
01:45:10,846 --> 01:45:11,847
It's headed to Oscorp!

1298
01:45:12,014 --> 01:45:14,391
And your daughter's there right now.

1299
01:45:27,154 --> 01:45:28,447
You gotta let me go.

1300
01:45:43,045 --> 01:45:44,046
Hold your fire!

1301
01:45:50,886 --> 01:45:53,389
Well, Paul, if I didn't see it,
I wouldn't believe it.

1302
01:45:53,556 --> 01:45:55,975
I won't venture to say
what it is crawling up...

1303
01:45:56,141 --> 01:45:58,060
...the north side of the Oscorp Tower...

1304
01:45:58,227 --> 01:46:01,480
...but clearly it is not human
and it is very, very strong.

1305
01:46:17,788 --> 01:46:20,499
<i>Time remaining: one minute.</i>

1306
01:47:32,738 --> 01:47:34,823
<i>Antidote complete.</i>

1307
01:47:47,670 --> 01:47:49,380
Oh, man.

1308
01:47:49,546 --> 01:47:52,383
<i>We're getting the latest details.
This is just coming in.</i>

1309
01:47:52,549 --> 01:47:56,220
<i>The New York Police Department
has called for a city-wide evacuation...</i>

1310
01:47:56,387 --> 01:47:58,347
<i>...everything south of 54th Street.</i>

1311
01:47:59,181 --> 01:48:00,975
<i>If you are south of 54th Street...</i>

1312
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:03,602
<i>...you have to move out
of the area immediately.</i>

1313
01:48:13,070 --> 01:48:15,656
<i>Spider-Man appears to be
heading towards Oscorp.</i>

1314
01:48:15,823 --> 01:48:16,865
<i>He looks injured...</i>

1315
01:48:17,032 --> 01:48:19,702
<i>...and it's really not clear
if he's gonna make it.</i>

1316
01:48:19,868 --> 01:48:22,496
That's the guy who saved
my boy on the bridge.

1317
01:48:22,663 --> 01:48:24,039
Troy, they're clearing us out.

1318
01:48:24,206 --> 01:48:26,625
Something bad's going down in Midtown.

1319
01:48:26,792 --> 01:48:29,378
Still friends with Matthews,
that crane operator on 6th?

1320
01:48:29,545 --> 01:48:31,463
- Yeah.
- Get him on the phone for me.

1321
01:48:31,630 --> 01:48:33,716
The cops are evacuating everybody.

1322
01:48:33,882 --> 01:48:36,093
Get him on the phone for me.

1323
01:48:53,694 --> 01:48:56,321
Hey, Charlie, get me
Enriquez on 54th Street!

1324
01:48:56,488 --> 01:48:58,574
- You got it.
- Angelo, get your mug over here.

1325
01:48:58,741 --> 01:49:01,076
Wolski! You're getting some overtime!

1326
01:49:02,411 --> 01:49:04,413
<i>All tower cranes on 6th...</i>

1327
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:08,292
<i>...swing your jib arms over the avenue.
Boom angles at 90 degrees.</i>

1328
01:49:08,459 --> 01:49:10,794
<i>Spider-Man needs those
big boys high and lined up.</i>

1329
01:49:10,961 --> 01:49:13,005
<i>Let's give him a clear approach. Over.</i>

1330
01:49:46,747 --> 01:49:48,415
Come on, Parker.

1331
01:51:44,156 --> 01:51:46,241
- Hey.
- Dad!

1332
01:51:46,408 --> 01:51:48,577
- I have to get this to Spider-Man.
- Get in.

1333
01:51:48,744 --> 01:51:50,579
- It can stop the Lizard.
- Get in the car.

1334
01:51:50,746 --> 01:51:53,624
- You don't understand!
- Yes, I do.

1335
01:51:53,790 --> 01:51:56,043
Your boyfriend is a man of many masks.

1336
01:51:56,210 --> 01:51:57,377
I get it.

1337
01:51:57,544 --> 01:51:58,629
Give me this.

1338
01:51:58,795 --> 01:52:00,631
Get in the car.

1339
01:52:04,218 --> 01:52:06,303
Please make sure he's okay.

1340

Poor Peter Parker.

01:53:50,949 --> 01:53:54,745
No mother, no father...

1344
01:53:55,871 --> 01:53:57,622
...no uncle.

1345
01:53:58,790 --> 01:54:00,542
All alone.

1346
01:54:01,918 --> 01:54:02,919
He's not alone.

1347

<i>Detonation in T-minus 45 seconds.</i>

1348

Hey! Gift from Gwen.

1349
01:54:37,662 --> 01:54:39,122

No!

1363

- Aah.
- Unh!

1364
01:57:09,105 --> 01:57:10,232
The captain.

1365

Captain!

- The Lizard.
- It's okay.

1367
01:57:18,406 --> 01:57:19,616
We stopped him.

1368
01:57:20,283 --> 01:57:22,285
- Okay.
- Let's get you out of here.

Look at me. Stay with me.

1372
01:57:27,958 --> 01:57:30,043
- Help's on the way, okay?
- You need to...

1373
01:57:30,210 --> 01:57:33,713
You need to be gone
when they get here.

1374
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:35,215
Okay?

1375
01:57:35,382 --> 01:57:36,675
I'm not going anywhere.

1376
01:57:37,259 --> 01:57:39,678
I was wrong about you, Peter.

1377
01:57:40,387 --> 01:57:41,930
This city needs you.

1378
01:57:43,932 --> 01:57:45,517
Here.

1379
01:57:45,684 --> 01:57:46,851
You're gonna need this.

1380
01:57:51,273 --> 01:57:53,233
You're gonna make enemies.

1381
01:57:55,652 --> 01:57:57,487
People will get hurt.

1382
01:57:59,072 --> 01:58:00,991
Sometimes the people closest to you.

1383
01:58:04,911 --> 01:58:06,913
So I want you to promise me
something, okay?

1384
01:58:08,832 --> 01:58:12,627
Leave Gwen out of it.

1385
01:58:15,171 --> 01:58:16,798
Promise me that.

1386
01:58:18,883 --> 01:58:20,760
Huh?

1387
01:58:22,429 --> 01:58:24,097
You promise me.

1388
01:58:32,814 --> 01:58:34,649
Oh...

1389
01:59:37,796 --> 01:59:39,047
<i>An eerie calm...</i>

01:59:41,424 --> 01:59:44,719
<i>Apparently, some sort
of aerosolized antidote...</i>

<i>...was launched from Oscorp Tower...</i>

<i>...which seems to have

<i>...knowing that the alleged mastermind...</i>

1396

<i>...on the street for a report

1399
02:00:02,654 --> 02:00:04,698
<i>John, what do you see?</i>

1400
02:00:37,564 --> 02:00:39,607
Sweetheart, it's all right.

1401
02:00:41,776 --> 02:00:43,653
It's all right.

1402
02:00:44,738 --> 02:00:46,156
It's all right.

1403
02:00:46,656 --> 02:00:47,657
Rough night.

1404
02:00:49,701 --> 02:00:51,369
It's gonna be all right.

1405
02:01:45,131 --> 02:01:46,841
Where have you been?

1406
02:01:49,844 --> 02:01:51,429
Hi.

1407
02:01:56,267 --> 02:01:57,894
My father died.

1408
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:03,608
There was a funeral.

1409
02:02:05,068 --> 02:02:11,157
They shot off rifles and
they made speeches.

1410
02:02:14,702 --> 02:02:16,663
Two of my teachers showed up.

1411
02:02:18,081 --> 02:02:19,457
And Flash showed up.

1412
02:02:24,379 --> 02:02:27,006
Everyone was there but you.

1413
02:02:41,604 --> 02:02:43,731
Can't do this. Can't do this.

1414
02:02:45,984 --> 02:02:48,027
I'm sorry. I can't, um...

1415
02:02:48,194 --> 02:02:49,612
What are you saying?

1416
02:02:49,779 --> 02:02:51,614
I can't see you anymore.

1417
02:02:53,575 --> 02:02:55,034
I can't.

1418
02:03:20,643 --> 02:03:22,645
He made you promise, didn't he?

1419
02:03:26,649 --> 02:03:30,528
To stay away from me,
so I'd be safe.

1420
02:03:57,013 --> 02:03:58,890
What a pretty girl.

1421
02:03:59,057 --> 02:04:00,224
Yeah.

1422
02:04:00,391 --> 02:04:02,185
That's what Uncle Ben said.

1423
02:04:03,227 --> 02:04:04,896
Did you ask her out?

1424
02:04:08,650 --> 02:04:09,984
Why?

1425
02:04:11,069 --> 02:04:12,528
Can't.

1426
02:04:13,821 --> 02:04:15,198
Why?

1427
02:04:17,784 --> 02:04:19,494
I'm just no good for her.

1428
02:04:22,664 --> 02:04:26,125
Peter Parker, if there's one thing
you are, it's good.

1429
02:04:27,168 --> 02:04:30,213
Anyone has a problem
with that can talk to me.

1430
02:04:47,939 --> 02:04:50,984
<i>Peter, I know things have been...</i>

1431
02:04:51,150 --> 02:04:54,612
<i>...difficult lately, and I'm sorry about that.</i>

1432
02:04:55,029 --> 02:04:57,991
<i>I think I know what you're feeling.</i>

1433
02:04:58,157 --> 02:05:00,743
<i>Ever since you were a little boy...</i>

1434
02:05:00,910 --> 02:05:05,331
<i>...you've been living with so
many unresolved things.</i>

1435
02:05:06,541 --> 02:05:08,835
<i>Well, take it from an old man:</i>

1436
02:05:09,419 --> 02:05:12,505
<i>Those things send us down a road.</i>

1437
02:05:12,672 --> 02:05:15,008
<i>They make us who we are.</i>

1438
02:05:15,258 --> 02:05:20,513
<i>And if anyone's destined
for greatness, it's you, son.</i>

1439
02:05:21,097 --> 02:05:23,516
<i>You owe the world your gifts.</i>

1440
02:05:24,100 --> 02:05:26,978
<i>You just have to figure out
how to use them.</i>

1441
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:30,857
<i>And know that wherever they take you...</i>

1442
02:05:31,024 --> 02:05:33,317
<i>...we'll always be here.</i>

1443
02:05:34,152 --> 02:05:36,738
<i>So come on home, Peter.</i>

1444
02:05:37,613 --> 02:05:39,449
<i>You're my hero.</i>

1445
02:05:39,615 --> 02:05:41,117
<i>And I love you.</i>

1446
02:05:49,542 --> 02:05:51,252
- What's up, Parker?
- What's up?

1447
02:05:51,419 --> 02:05:52,879
Hey. How's it going?

1448
02:05:53,838 --> 02:05:55,214
You coming along, man?

1449
02:05:56,799 --> 02:05:58,176
Cool shirt.

1450
02:05:59,510 --> 02:06:00,636
Yeah.

1451
02:06:00,803 --> 02:06:02,305
Dude's crazy.

1452
02:06:02,472 --> 02:06:03,848
But chicks dig him.

1453
02:06:06,642 --> 02:06:09,353
Come on, guys, you heard the bell.
Get to class.

1454
02:06:18,821 --> 02:06:21,699
<i>I had a professor once
who liked to tell his students...</i>

1455
02:06:21,866 --> 02:06:25,119
...that there were only
10 different plots in all of fiction.

1456
02:06:26,079 --> 02:06:28,164
Well, I'm here to tell you he was wrong.

1457
02:06:28,331 --> 02:06:29,749
There is only one:

1458
02:06:30,666 --> 02:06:32,168
"Who am I"?

1459
02:06:32,877 --> 02:06:34,796
Mr Parker.

1460
02:06:34,962 --> 02:06:35,963
Tardy again.

1461
02:06:37,924 --> 02:06:39,759
At least we can always count on you.

1462
02:06:39,926 --> 02:06:42,678
Sorry, Miss Ritter,
won't happen again, I promise.

1463
02:06:42,845 --> 02:06:44,931
Don't make promises you can't keep.

1464
02:06:47,183 --> 02:06:49,352
Yeah, but those are the best kind.

1465
02:06:49,519 --> 02:06:51,354
Okay, class, open your books.

1466
02:06:51,521 --> 02:06:53,523
Let's begin on page one.

1467
02:09:48,781 --> 02:09:51,367
Hello, doctor.

1468
02:09:51,534 --> 02:09:52,868
Did you tell the boy?

1469
02:09:53,035 --> 02:09:54,078
Tell him what?

1470
02:09:54,245 --> 02:09:57,999
Did you tell the boy
the truth about his father?

1471
02:09:59,667 --> 02:10:01,043
No.

1472
02:10:01,210 --> 02:10:03,713
Well, that's very good.
So we'll let him be...

1473
02:10:03,879 --> 02:10:04,880
...for now.

1474
02:10:05,881 --> 02:10:07,967
You should leave him alone!
