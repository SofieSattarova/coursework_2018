1
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,500
"Edge City"

2
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,900
Another one coming down.

3
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,100
Hang on.

4
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,900
THE MASK

5
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,000
I got those...

6
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,300
concert tickets you wanted.

7
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,800
You're kidding!

9
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,600
For Friday night?

10
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,600
Stanley, this is great.

11
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,300
What time do I pick you up?

12
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,300
Here's the thing.

13
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,100
My best girlfriend is here
and she'd die to go to this...

14
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,900
so could we get an extra ticket
for her?

15
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,300
They're sold out. That means
there's no more.

16
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,500
I can't let her sit home all alone.

17
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,600
I'll tell you what.

18
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,100
Go with your friend.

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,700
I couldn't do that.

20
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,200
No, come on.

21
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,800
Stanley, you are the nicest guy.

22
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,000
Really, you are.

23
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,900
- Isn't he the nicest guy?
- The best.

24
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,700
That was the most sickening display

25
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,200
- I've ever seen.
- I disagree.

26
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,900
I'm wearing her down.

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,300
Buddy, you need a little
change of pace.

28
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,300
Tonight, I'll take you
on a love safari.

29
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,800
Deep into the darkest heart
of the urban jungle.

30
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,900
Tell me more, bwana.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,800
The Coco Bongo Club.
Hottest new joint in town.

32
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,400
Only the cr me de la cr me
need apply.

33
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,700
- How do we get in?
- Are you kidding?

34
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,100
Leave it to me.
Trust me, buddy.

35
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,400
This will be the perfect...

36
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,900
night on the town.

37
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,500
Hold the phone.

38
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,800
Killer at three o'clock.

39
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,900
Stand back and observe.

40
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,400
Where do I open an account?

41
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,200
New accounts,right here.

42
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,800
You're lucky, I was on my way out--

43
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,500
Hold this for me, please?

44
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,800
I'll hold anything you want.

45
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,200
Can you help me?

46
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,000
So...

47
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,300
what kind of account do you want?

48
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,700
Well, I'm not sure exactly. I'm
just terrible with things like that.

49
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,100
That's an interesting tie, Mister...

50
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,500
Ipkiss, Stanley Ipkiss.

51
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,200
Tina Carlyle, it's a pleasure.

52
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,000
Pleasure's all mine.

53
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,000
May l?

54
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,400
What?

55
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,300
I'm such a mess.

56
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,000
Oh, of course.

57
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,300
That's what they're there for.

58
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,600
As I was saying, that tie...

59
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,700
reminds me of those,
what do you call it, ink blot tests.

60
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,700
- A Rorschach test.
- Right.

61
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,000
It sort of looks like...

62
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,900
a young woman riding bareback.

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Sort of...

64
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,600
Lady Godiva or something.

65
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,500
Of course.

66
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,100
What do you see, Mr. Ipkiss?

67
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,100
I don't know.

68
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,100
Bright colors...

69
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,700
It's a power tie.

70
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,600
Supposed to make you feel...

71
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,700
powerful.

72
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,200
Does it work?

73
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,500
Now, how about that account?

74
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,700
We have...

75
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,900
several different plans.

76
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,300
Savings.

77
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,900
Checking.

78
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,500
Savings and checking.

79
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,900
Savings and CD's.

80
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,200
Checking and CD's.

81
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,200
Savings, checking and CD's.
T-Bills.

82
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,200
Or we can throw your money
in a big mattress.

83
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,300
Now, I have some forms
for you to fill out.

84
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,200
That's it, sweetheart.
Now just a little bit to the right.

85
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,200
Keep it down back there.

86
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,900
We'll try.

87
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,200
- What do you think?
- Layout's not bad. But...

88
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,200
the motion detectors are a pain.

89
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,500
But you can pull this off, right?

90
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,500
You talking to the Doctor.

91
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,500
I do have one question.

92
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,400
Which is?

93
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,000
What's Niko have to say about this?

94
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,600
Nothing.

95
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,500
- This isn't his grift.
- Get real, man.

96
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,500
Everything is his grift.

97
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,800
He owns you, he owns this club,
he owns this whole stinking town.

98
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,200
Things change.

99
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,100
You mess with Niko, you end up
taking a dirt nap.

100
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,000
He's the only one who's napping...

101
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,800
and I'm about to give him
a serious wake-up call.

102
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,000
But we need cash...

103
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,300
so first we take the bank...

104
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,900
then we take Niko...

105
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,200
and then, my friend,
school is out.

106
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,700
And this whole city is our playground.

107
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,000
Bub, watch where you're going!

108
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,200
Hang on, hang on!

109
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Don't get your panties in a twist.

110
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,800
What the hell is it?

111
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,000
I don't know...

112
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,300
about seven hundred bucks, eh?

113
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,100
Now, what can I do for you, bub?

114
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,100
I'm here for the Civic.

115
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,000
The brake drums are shot
and you need a new transmission.

116
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,800
What?!

117
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,900
All I wanted was an oil change.

118
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,100
Lucky we caught these problems
before they caused serious trouble.

119
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,100
Sign right here, and press down hard.

120
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,800
- There's no price.
- There will be.

121
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,400
I've no car.
I need a car tonight.

122
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,900
Bring around the loaner.

123
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,800
The loaner?

124
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,000
The loaner?

125
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,600
It's a classic.

126
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,100
Gals, meet my buddy Stanley Ipkiss.

127
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,600
Humungo in the banking business.

128
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,800
- Not really.
- Let's get in this joint.

129
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,800
How you doing, buddy?

130
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,700
- It's Charlie!
- How you doing?

131
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,300
- How you doing, my friend?
- Long time no see.

132
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,000
Good to see you.

133
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,800
Come on, gals.

134
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,900
See you on the inside.

135
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,300
This is a mistake.

136
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,200
You crossed the rope.
Never cross the rope.

137
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,400
- My friends are inside.
- Lose him.

138
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,200
This isn't fair.

139
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,600
Watch it, I'm a bleeder.

140
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,800
Put me down now, or I am
never coming back here.

141
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
Jeez.

142
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,200
Mr. Ipkiss!

143
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,000
Hi.

144
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,900
Are you okay?

145
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,500
Me?

146
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,900
I'm great..

147
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,900
Really good.

148
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,200
I never felt better, really.

149
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,300
I'm just...

150
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,600
catching some air.

151
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,600
Your car, sir.

152
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,000
That's not my car.

153
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,600
It matches the ticket.

154
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,200
Alright...

155
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,300
I'll take it.

156
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,200
But I am very angry!

157
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,200
Believe this?

158
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,900
You drive in in a Porsche...

159
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,500
Hey, Mister!

160
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,200
Hold on!

161
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,500
I know CPR!

162
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
Hey, you!

163
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,000
What are you doing down there?

164
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,700
I'm just looking for...

165
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,600
my mask!

166
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,400
I got it.

167
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,800
Do you have any idea what time it is?

168
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,600
Actually, no.

169
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,900
My new carpet!

170
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,800
Well ,this is coming right out
of your security deposit.

171
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,900
You know...

172
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,100
What?

173
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Nothing.

174
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,500
Well, that's what you are, Ipkiss,
a big nothing.

175
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,600
Aren't you due at the lab
to get your bolts tightened?

176
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,400
I should have said that.

177
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
Hey, you.

178
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,700
Milo!

179
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,400
No jumping up allowed.
It's against doggie ordinance.

180
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,900
What do you want?

181
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,700
You want me to throw that?

182
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,400
I'm very tired.

183
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,200
I'll throw it one time.

184
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,300
I won't throw it with you
attached to it.

185
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,600
You ready?

186
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,200
Get it.

187
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,500
Ipkiss!

188
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,800
Turn down those cartoons!

189
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,400
Alright, Mrs. Peenman!

190
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,200
Dr. Neuman, you say that everybody
wears a mask?

191
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,000
That's correct.

192
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,000
We all wear masks,
metaphorically speaking.

193
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,100
We suppress the id,
our darkest desires...

194
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,100
and adopt a more socially
acceptable image.

195
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,500
The book is "The Masks We Wear"
by Dr. Arthur Neuman.

196
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,300
Thank you for being here.

197
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,700
What's the matter with you?

198
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,900
What is it?

199
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,200
What are you looking for?

200
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,300
You like this thing? You like it?

201
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,100
"The Masks We Wear".

202
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,500
"That's correct.

203
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,100
We all wear masks,
metaphorically speaking".

204
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,300
Yeah, right.

205
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,500
Smoking!

206
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,600
It's party time.

207
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,100
P-A-R-T-Y

208
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,300
Why? Because I gotta.

209
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,000
MANAGER

210
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,900
QUIET PLEASE

211
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,100
Snooze!

212
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Look, ma, I'm road kill!

213
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,900
- Get out of the road!
- I think he wants to communicate.

214
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,700
squeeze me gently

215
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,700
Hey, mister...

216
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,700
you got the time?

217
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,400
As a matter of fact, I do, Cubbie!

218
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,700
Look at that!

219
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,900
Time to honk your nose and pull
your underwear over your head.

220
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,200
Come on!

221
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,200
Step right up here, don't be shy!

222
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,400
Nobody likes...

223
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,800
a bashful leather head.

224
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,900
Move it!

225
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,400
For my first trick...

226
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,800
I'll do something for you, son.

227
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:17,400
We have a giraffe. There you go, son.
Now get out of here, you bother me.

228
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
Now...

229
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Sorry, wrong pocket.

230
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,900
For you...

231
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,900
a little body English.

232
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,100
A French poodle.

233
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,400
The dog was rabid, had to put it down.

234
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,700
At last but not least, my favorite.

235
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,300
A Tommy gun.

236
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,600
This is incredible.

237
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,200
With these powers I could be...

238
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,200
a superhero.

239
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,400
I'd fight crime,
protect the innocent...

240
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,100
work for world peace.

241
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,700
But first...

242
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
RIPLEY'S AUTO FINISHING

243
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,600
Hold onto your lug nuts...

244
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,700
it's time for an overhaul.

245
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,600
It was a dream.

246
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,600
It was a dream.

247
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
I must lay off the cartoons.

248
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,600
Lt. Kellaway. You know anything
about the disturbance last night?

249
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,300
Disturbance?

250
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,600
Some prowler broke in
and attacked Mrs. Peenman.

251
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,200
Attacked?

252
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,900
You didn't hear anything?

253
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,300
She unloaded a couple of rounds
of buckshot 5 feet from here.

254
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,400
Look at the floor.

255
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,000
He put that right in my floor,
then he jumped out...

256
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,500
the window. Officer,
are you writing notes?

257
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,400
This is...

258
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,700
impossible.

259
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,600
Those pyjamas are impossible.
This happened.

260
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,300
See, I have...

261
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,500
an inner ear problem.

262
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,800
- Sometimes I can't hear anything.
- Is that so?

263
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:39,500
Here's my card. If you recall
anything unusual about last night...

264
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,100
anything at all, call me.

265
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,800
You bet. Thank you.

266
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,000
And good luck...

267
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,400
cracking the case.

268
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,100
Oh, my God, I'm late!

269
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,300
Keys, keys...

270
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,200
Where's the keys?

271
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,500
Damn.

272
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,500
Get the keys.

273
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,700
Find them.

274
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,900
Get the keys.

275
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,600
I am so late.

276
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,800
Good boy.

277
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,100
Come on, Milo. Give them to me.
Drop it.

278
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,600
I want a proctologist standing by.

279
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,700
The best one you can find.

280
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,600
Can you tell me what happened?

281
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,500
- No, you can quote me.
- Looks like some Mob tactic.

282
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,800
She broke the case. Come on,
get these rubbernecks out of here.

283
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,500
Where were you last night?
We looked all over for you.

284
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,500
Did you happen to look outside,
in the gutter?

285
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,100
Did you check the paper?

286
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,000
Your girlfriend got a great review.

287
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,100
Bombshell Explodes at Coco Bongo

288
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,000
You're 50 minutes late.
That's like stealing.

289
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,800
I'm sorry, Mr. Dickey. It'll never
happen again. I've been a jerk.

290
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,700
If you weren't busy oogling
girlie pictures...

291
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,000
you might get some work done.

292
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,900
Sir. She's a perspective
client of Stanley's.

293
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,400
Really?

294
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,200
The next time she comes in...

295
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,700
send her to my office.

296
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,000
You bet.

297
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,300
Gee, I wish "my" daddy
owned a bank.

298
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,600
Then I could be a rich
little creep too.

299
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,600
You think she'll ever come back?

300
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,200
Oh, man, forget her. Listen to me.

301
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,900
Girls like her always look for
the BBD: Bigger Better Deal.

302
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,300
You don't know that.

303
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,400
She's an artist. She's...

304
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,700
- sensitive.
- Forget her.

305
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,900
She'll rip out your heart,
put it in a blender and hit "frappe".

306
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:53,800
You don't need her.
You need somebody down to earth.

307
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:58,000
Somebody with some integrity.
Somebody with...

308
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,300
red hair...

309
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,300
full, pouting lips...

310
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,600
a white blouse, green jacket...

311
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,000
and a name tag.

312
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,300
You really narrowed it down.

313
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,600
Too bad she's already taken.

314
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,100
Hello there, may I be of assistance?

315
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
Stanley Ipkiss?

316
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,800
Hi! I'm Peggy Brandt
from the Tribune.

317
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,800
I canceled my subscription because
they kept stealing--

318
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,700
No, actually, I want to ask you
a few questions.

319
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,400
Really? About what?

320
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,200
Ripley Auto Finishing.
You're a customer, aren't you?

321
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,400
Me?

322
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,500
I don't even have a car.

323
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,200
You know, 'cause they pollute.

324
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,700
You don't own an '89 Civic?

325
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,000
Oh, that car, yeah.

326
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,600
It's coming back to me.

327
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,100
Miss... What was your name?

328
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,500
Peggy Brandt.

329
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,700
Wait a minute.

330
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,500
Peggy Brandt?

331
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,100
Of "Ask Peggy"?

332
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,000
That's right.

333
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
You printed one of my letters
last year.

334
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,500
Remember? "Nice Guys Finish Last."

335
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,100
You're Mister Nice Guy?

336
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:25,800
Do you realize how much mail
we got about that letter?

337
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:29,200
100's of women are looking
for a guy like you.

338
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,500
Really?

339
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,700
You know how hard it is to find
a decent man in this town?

340
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,500
Most think monogamy is a kind of wood.

341
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,300
Why are you covering this story?

342
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:51,000
Because "Dear Peggy" pays dick.
I'm starving to death.

343
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,300
I'm looking to become a real reporter.

344
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,400
When you were at Ripley Auto
did you see anything suspicious?

345
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,700
Anything?

346
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,700
I won't make trouble for you.

347
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,300
I just want the truth.

348
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,600
God, I wish I knew the truth.
You know, I really do.

349
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,500
If you think of anything...

350
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,400
this is my number.

351
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,300
This is my...

352
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,800
you know, personal number.

353
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,500
100's of women are looking
for a guy like me?

354
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,900
Sure.

355
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,900
I'm one of them.

356
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,200
120 yards.

357
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,000
Hello, Dorian.

358
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,900
Thanks for dropping by.

359
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,300
Next time, call.
Leave the delivery boys at home.

360
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,900
The cops...

361
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,900
tried to shut the club
down this morning.

362
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:28,600
They say you've been using the place
to run your own small-time scams.

363
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,200
When I hear things like that...

364
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,700
I start losing my concentration.

365
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,500
My game...

366
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,700
it goes straight to hell.

367
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,400
You could too.

368
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
205 yards.

369
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,200
I'm fed up with you...

370
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,600
but....

371
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,300
I'll cut you a break.

372
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,900
One week to get out of town.

373
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,100
After that...

374
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,800
I'll use your empty little skull
to break in my new nine iron.

375
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,700
Are you okay?

376
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,300
Your car, sir.

377
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,800
I am now.

378
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,100
Tina, come on.

379
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,800
You can't.

380
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,300
You can't.

381
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,300
Go on.

382
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,400
I don't believe it.

383
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,100
Stupid.

384
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,800
She would never...

385
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
No way!

386
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,200
Hold on, Sugar.

387
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,500
Daddy's got a sweet tooth tonight.

388
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,800
Somebody,stop me.

389
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,500
Can't make the scene
if you don't have the green.

390
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,700
I better make a little stop.

391
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,000
EDGE CITY POWER
"SERVICE WORTH WAITING FOR"

392
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,800
How's it going, Freeze?

393
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,300
It's looking good here.

394
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,700
You're on your own. I must
go downstairs, make sure I'm seen.

395
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,800
Do it.

396
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:50,400
The doctor is about to operate.

397
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,400
Sorry, fellas. Waste not, want not.

398
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,900
Cops!

399
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,400
Not on the list, not in the club.

400
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,500
How do?

401
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,800
You on the list?

402
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:13,100
No, but I believe my friends are.
Perhaps you know them?

403
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,900
Franklin, Grant...

404
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,200
and Jackson.

405
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,100
That's it! No one gets in.

406
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,500
Now we present the most beautiful
flower of the Congo Bongo...

407
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,700
Miss Tina Carlyle.

408
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,800
Beautiful.

409
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,500
Love makes me treat you...

410
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,000
The way that I do
Gee, baby...

411
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,400
ain't I good to you

412
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,500
There's nothing too good...

413
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,100
for a boy that's so true

414
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,300
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

415
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,900
I bought you a fur coat
for Christmas

416
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,500
A diamond ring...

417
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,400
a Cadillac car...

418
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,600
And everything

419
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,400
Love makes me treat you...

420
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,900
the way that I do

421
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,900
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

422
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,000
Love makes me treat you...

423
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,400
the way that I do

424
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,400
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

425
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,100
There's nothing too good...

426
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,000
for a man so true

427
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,800
Gee,baby, ain't I good to you

428
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,600
I know how to make a man happy
I'll treat you right

429
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,800
- Why are you here?
- There's trouble.

430
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,400
You better come upstairs.

431
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,200
Come on, let's go.

432
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,700
They got me paying taxes...

433
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,600
for what I gave to you

434
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,600
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

435
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,900
Let's rock this joint.

436
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,100
Smoking.

437
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,500
What happened?

438
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,900
Someone hit the joint before us.

439
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,900
Get that, Doc.

440
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,400
Suck on that.

441
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,400
Son of a bitch!

442
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,200
Who did this, man?

443
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,000
Who?!

444
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,200
Him!

445
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,800
That's the guy.

446
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,200
The guy dancing with Tina?

447
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,100
He's dead meat.

448
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,300
Come on.

449
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,800
I want this place cleared now.

450
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:48,000
Club's closed. Move it!
You think I'm joking? Come on, move it!

451
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,100
Party's over, let's go!

452
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,100
Get out of here.

453
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,700
Get lost!

454
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,900
Okay, Twinkle Toes.

455
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,400
Where is my money, tell me now.

456
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,000
You've got 17.5 %  in T-bills
amortized over the fiscal year.

457
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,300
8 %  in stocks and bonds.

458
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,900
Carry the 9, divide by the GNP...

459
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,600
Fortunately, funeral bouquets
are deductible.

460
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,100
Ice this deadbeat.

461
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,500
Shoot him!

462
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:33,800
Thanks.

463
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,100
You got me, partner.

464
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,000
Hold me close,Red.

465
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,900
It's getting dark.

466
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,800
Tell Auntie Em to let Old Yeller out.

467
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,100
Tell Tiny Tim I won't be coming home
this Christmas.

468
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,900
Tell Scarlet I do give a damn.

469
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,400
Pardon me.

470
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,700
Thank you.

471
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,700
You love me.

472
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,800
You really love me.

473
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,800
You're not going anywhere.

474
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,900
Drop it, Tyrel!

475
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,300
Drop it.

476
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:13,400
You got a warrant?
Or did you come for a nightcap?

477
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,500
What I got is probable cause.

478
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,900
Your boys knocked over Edge City Bank.

479
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,800
Easy. You're giving me a woody.

480
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,500
And one was wearing a big,
green mask.

481
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,200
For once, you're right.

482
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,700
Except it wasn't one of my boys.

483
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:33,300
Maybe if you tried a little
actual police work...

484
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,800
Cuff him.

485
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,400
We got a stiff upstairs.
It's a guy from the heist.

486
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,400
Call that high-priced
lawyer of yours.

487
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,700
We'll go downtown for a chat.

488
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,700
Get him out of here.

489
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,900
I know you're in there.

490
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,300
Police!

491
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,600
Open up!

492
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,400
Oh, my God.

493
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,600
I know you're in there!

494
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,300
Open up!

495
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:37,300
Come on, I'm getting blisters
on my fingers.

496
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,600
Stop it.

497
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,000
I'm coming, okay.

498
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,500
I'll be right there.

499
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,900
Let's go, move it!

500
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,900
Alright!

501
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,300
Hi, Lieutenant.

502
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,000
This isn't the best time right now.
I just--

503
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:09,000
Won't you come in?

504
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,300
Where were you last night?

505
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,900
Here, mostly.

506
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:16,900
Something wrong?

507
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
What do you know about The Mask?

508
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,200
"Mask?"

509
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,900
Don't insult my intelligence.

510
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,800
He robs the bank you work in,
then I find this in the Coco Bongo.

511
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,500
There can't be 2 idiots
with these pajamas.

512
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:34,100
May I see those pajamas?

513
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,000
Those pajamas?

514
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,900
Those pajamas...

515
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,400
were stolen.

516
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,100
Somebody stole your pajamas?

517
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,700
What is this city coming to...

518
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:01,000
when a man's pajama drawer is
no longer safe!

519
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,800
Look at that guy.

520
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:11,000
- Nobody's that fast at my bank.
- I'll say.

521
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,300
That's one hell of a rubber mask.

522
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,700
Lab reports?

523
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:22,300
We got fingerprints from currency,
but nothing matches Tyrel's men.

524
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,900
He beat them to the punch.

525
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,800
Get the bank employee files and run
down the prints on a guy named Ipkiss.

526
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,400
You figure it was an inside job?

527
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:35,100
I need some prints to lock
this whack job up till doomsday.

528
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,600
50 grand...

529
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:44,200
to whoever finds that green bastard
before the cops.

530
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:47,700
I want you to get the word out
to every street hustler...

531
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,500
every low life in this town.
Understand?

532
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,700
I want him here tomorrow, alive.

533
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,000
You still here?

534
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Come on, let's go.

535
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,800
What are you looking at?

536
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:06,900
You.

537
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,600
You're losing it.

538
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:12,400
I'm not losing anything...

539
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,400
except maybe some extra baggage.

540
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,000
What's that mean?

541
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,700
You didn't fight much last night
when that freak kissed you.

542
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:25,000
Did it look like I had much
of a choice?

543
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,800
Maybe you did...

544
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,800
maybe you didn't. Who knows, right?

545
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,800
I'll tell you one thing.

546
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,300
It's going to be payback for anybody
who crosses me.

547
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:54,500
We have a crisis here and you
stroll in an hour late?

548
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,600
If I must put up with--

549
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,400
Back off, monkey boy...

550
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:03,200
or I'll tell your dad you treat
this place like your piggy bank.

551
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,200
Or we should call the IRS...

552
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,500
and arrange a vacation for you
at Club Fed?

553
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,600
That'll be all.

554
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,600
Genius.

555
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:22,300
That was genius. Buddy, I have chills.

556
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,300
God! What side of whose bed
did you wake up on, man?

557
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,800
I'm not sure.

558
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,200
I haven't exactly been myself lately.

559
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,400
You don't look real fabulous.

560
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,400
Really, do I look bad?

561
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,200
Don't worry. This'll put the color
back in your cheeks.

562
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:44,600
2 tickets to the charity ball
at the Coco Bongo Club, Saturday.

563
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,100
Anybody who's anybody will be there.

564
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,100
Want to be my date?

565
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,000
Wait just a minute.

566
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:01,500
- Why are you here?
- I wanted to thank you.

567
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,500
I don't have much to open an account
with anymore.

568
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,900
What about the club?
You were doing great.

569
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,900
It's not your problem.
I'll be okay.

570
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,600
Come here.

571
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,800
You didn't stop by just to see me,
did you?

572
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,700
It's okay, tell me.

573
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,100
The guy they say robbed this place...

574
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,000
- The Mask?
- I think he was at the club.

575
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,300
Really?

576
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,000
They say he's pretty...

577
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,200
weird looking.

578
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,900
Yeah, but...

579
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,400
you should see him dance.

580
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:52,600
Did anyone find out who he is?

581
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,800
Why, you interested?

582
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,800
Just curious, I guess.

583
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:04,400
I better be going.

584
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,500
Thanks for everything.

585
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,700
You'd like to see him again?

586
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,400
I wouldn't mind.

587
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,100
I know him, you know.

588
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,800
You do?

589
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:25,000
We're old college buddies,
him and me.

590
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,800
It's funny you mention
he dances because...

591
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,900
I taught him a couple of
dance moves myself.

592
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,200
Think you could have him
meet me tonight?

593
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,300
Maybe I could work something out.

594
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,300
- How about at Landfill Park?
- Sunset.

595
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,300
- Perfect.
- Super.

596
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:52,100
Thanks, Stanley.
You really are a nice guy.

597
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,200
This is an interesting place.

598
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:04,500
Looks like fourth-
or fifth-century Scandinavian.

599
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,900
Possibly a representation of one
of the Norse night gods, maybe Loki.

600
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,600
Loki?

601
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,100
Who is Loki?

602
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,700
The Norse god of mischief.

603
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:22,700
Supposedly he caused such trouble that
Odin banished him from Valhalla forever.

604
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:27,500
Then he could have banished him
into that mask.

605
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,600
I'm talking about mythology,
Mr. Ipkiss.

606
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,600
This is a piece of wood.

607
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,100
but your book...!

608
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,700
My book is about
masks as a metaphor.

609
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,900
A metaphor,not to be taken literally.

610
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,900
You suffer from a mild delusion.

611
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,500
Alright.

612
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,600
I'll prove it to you.

613
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,400
But I am not responsible
for the consequences.

614
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,300
Just sit back and enjoy the ride,
Mr. Expert.

615
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,500
You don't scare me.
Go right ahead.

616
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,800
See you.

617
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:38,300
You said Loki was a night god.
Maybe it works at night.

618
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,800
I should warn you that I don't work
personally with really sick people.

619
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:47,300
There are private institutions
for those things.

620
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,400
I can arrange for a safe environment
for you tonight, if you want.

621
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,300
I must see Tina.

622
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,200
But what can I do?

623
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,100
Do I go as myself...

624
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,800
or The Mask?

625
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:10,400
If I tell you, you promise
to leave my office right now?

626
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,900
Go as yourself...

627
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,200
and as The Mask.

628
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:25,700
Because they are both
one and the same beautiful person.

629
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:30,600
Got the cross-check on
the fingerprints. It's Ipkiss.

630
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,000
I'm looking at him.

631
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:34,600
Keep the SWAT team standing by.

632
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:38,300
If he's half as bad as they say,
we'll have a full dance card.

633
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,100
Pickle relish?

634
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,100
- Get in the car.
- But I ordered onion rings.

635
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,600
LANDFILL PARK

636
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,800
What are you doing here?

637
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:19,500
I wanted to make sure that you
2 got together all right.

638
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,400
That's nice.

639
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,800
I hardly ever stop by here.

640
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,000
It's hard to believe it was...

641
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,300
a garbage heap.

642
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:35,600
It's really beautiful
right around sunset.

643
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:39,600
The methane emissions
really pick up the colors.

644
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,100
All those...

645
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,800
pinks and greens.

646
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,300
My friend will be along here
any minute. I better go.

647
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,000
Stanley, wait.

648
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,900
Hello, cherie.

649
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,100
We meet again!

650
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,400
Is it fate?

651
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,500
Is it meant to be?
It is written in the stars...

652
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:14,000
that we are destined to fraternize?

653
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:17,000
I'd like to think so.

654
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:25,800
Kiss me, my dear, and I will reveal
my croissant.

655
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:30,600
I will spread your p t . I will dip
my ladle in your vichyssoise.

656
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,200
She's so coy.

657
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,200
I love it.

658
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,800
Our love is like a red, red rose.

659
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:51,400
And I am a little thorny.

660
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,000
Je t'adore! Je t'adore!

661
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,200
Shoot the window. I don't care!

662
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,900
This is Kellaway.
I need back-up.

663
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,800
Cigarette?

664
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,100
Now, like Napoleon...

665
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,700
I will divide and conquer.

666
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,800
Police!

667
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,100
Merde.

668
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,500
Freeze.

669
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,200
Put your hands up.

670
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:36,500
But you told me to freeze.

671
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,800
Alright, alright, unfreeze.

672
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,900
You're under arrest.

673
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,800
It wasn't me.

674
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,300
It was the one-armed man.

675
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,000
Alright, I confess.

676
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,400
I did it, you hear?
And I'm glad, glad, I tell you!

677
00:58:55,800 --> 00:59:00,100
What are they going to do to me, Sarge?
What are they going to do?

678
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:03,500
Sorry, son, that's not my department.

679
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,800
Search him.

680
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,400
Where's a camcorder when you need one?

681
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,900
It's going to be a long night.
My wife'll kill me.

682
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,600
- What is it?
- Cops got Ipkiss at Landfill Park.

683
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:26,300
Let me cover it. I need this story.
You go home to Claire.

684
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,600
I don't know. Ramsey said--

685
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,900
I will take care of Ramsey.

686
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,700
Thanks a million, I owe you one.

687
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,400
Really big sunglasses, nerf ball...

688
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,900
Bike horn...

689
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:41,800
Small-mouthed bass...
bowling pin...

690
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,400
mouse-trap...

691
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,200
rubber chicken...

692
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,300
- Little to the left. That's it.
- I don't know.

693
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,400
Funny eyeball glasses...

694
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,700
I've never seen those in my life.

695
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,000
- bazooka.
- I have a permit for that.

696
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,000
- Picture of Kellaway's wife...
- What?

697
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,200
CALL ME LOVER!

698
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:04,300
Margaret! Son of a bitch!

699
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,700
I figured you had a sense of humor.

700
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,000
you married her!

701
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:15,100
That's got to hurt.

702
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,500
Get him!

703
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,600
It's over. Raise your hands...

704
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:44,700
or we'll fire.

705
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,400
Hit it!

706
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:14,300
They call me Cuban Pete
I'm the king of the rumba beat

707
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,900
When I play the maracas

708
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,800
I go chick-chicky boom

709
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,500
Yes, I'm Cuban Pete

710
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,800
I'm the craze of my street

711
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:27,000
When I start to dance everything goes
Chick-chicky boom, chick-chicky boom

712
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,200
The senoritas sing...

713
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,600
and they swing

714
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,600
It's very nice

715
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,700
Full of spice

716
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:40,000
They dance and bring a happy ring
Never a care

717
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:44,000
Singing a song
All the day long

718
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:50,400
If you like the beat
Take a lesson from Cuban Pete

719
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,700
I'll teach you to
chick-chicky boom

720
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,800
He's a modest guy

721
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:59,200
Although he's the hottest guy

722
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:03,200
In Havana

723
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:05,300
Si, senorita, I know...

724
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,000
that when I chicky boom

725
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,300
It's very nice
so full of spice

726
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,500
I place my hand on your hip

727
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,300
And if you will give me your hand

728
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,300
Then we shall try
Just you and I

729
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:24,300
- Not bad.
- Shut up and help me down.

730
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:28,000
I'll teach you to chick-chicky boom
Chick-chicky boom

731
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:52,100
Dance and I'll blow your brains out.

732
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:57,800
Give me that thing.

733
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,500
See you!

734
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:04,700
There! Let's get him.
Snap out of it. This dance is over!

735
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,200
Let's go! Follow me, officers!

736
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:17,200
He's down the alley. Follow me.
Come on. Grab your gun.

737
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:39,900
Stanley, get in!

738
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,200
There!

739
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,500
Halt, or I'll shoot!

740
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:49,700
Shoot! Shoot!

741
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,400
Seat belts.

742
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,800
I missed him.

743
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:02,600
Come on, we all missed him.

744
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,600
THE MASK ROBS BANK

745
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,400
I saw it.

746
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,100
I saw everything.

747
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,400
What's happening to you, Stanley?

748
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,800
It's crazy.

749
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:28,000
I'm losing control.

750
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,100
When I put that mask on...

751
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,300
I can do anything.

752
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:35,300
Be anything.

753
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:40,600
It's wrecking my life.

754
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:44,700
My life is wrecked. Wrecked.

755
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:49,300
I don't know what's happening to you...

756
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:53,000
but I do know this:

757
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:57,500
that letter you sent my column...

758
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,600
that was from a guy with more guts...

759
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,500
and more heart...

760
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:06,900
than any of the creeps
I've met in this city.

761
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Whatever that mask is...

762
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:11,500
you don't need it.

763
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,800
You...

764
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:17,000
Stanley Ipkiss...

765
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,300
are already all you'll ever need to be.

766
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,700
Gosh, Peg...

767
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,200
do you really mean that?

768
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,900
Actually...

769
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:35,000
no.

770
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:36,700
What?

771
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:41,700
Where were you? I've been vamping
for 20 minutes.

772
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:43,700
Is this him?

773
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:45,700
You got the 50 thou'?

774
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:48,800
Give her the money.

775
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,300
Right.

776
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:56,100
With the mask on, he turns
into that green thing.

777
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,000
What are you doing?

778
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:06,300
Sorry. You really are a great guy,
I just can't lose my condo.

779
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,400
It's so hard to find an apartment
in this city.

780
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:15,900
You said you wouldn't hurt him!

781
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,200
I lied.

782
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,200
Tell me.

783
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:42,800
How's this mask work?

784
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,700
I don't know. You just...

785
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:47,900
put it on.

786
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:02,000
Boss...

787
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,400
be careful, huh?

788
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,500
What a rush.

789
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:31,700
You okay?

790
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,800
I'm better than ever, you idiot.

791
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,000
What do we do with Ipkiss?

792
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:43,300
The police want the mask.

793
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:46,400
We'll give them The Mask.

794
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:58,900
The money better be here...

795
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,600
or you can lp-kiss your ass good-bye.

796
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,000
Get over there.

797
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:05,000
Can't believe it. Hardened cops
dancing in the street...

798
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:07,600
and broadcast on the 11 o'clock news.

799
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:10,500
- The SWAT team was offered Vegas.
- I'm history.

800
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:14,600
The Captain'll have my badge
for breakfast with a pension on top.

801
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:18,200
It's not all your fault.
Something will turn up.

802
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:22,000
Sure, Ipkiss will fall
right into my lap.

803
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:30,700
Get him off of me!

804
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:37,000
Wait!

805
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,800
I can explain everything.

806
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:42,700
You can explain everything?
Explain this!

807
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:47,300
Get him up! Let's go!
I got a cell for you, pal.

808
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:12,400
Forget about me, buddy.

809
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,700
Find a new place to live.

810
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,600
I'll be in here for a long, long time.

811
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,700
You, with the face.

812
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:37,300
You got a visitor.

813
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,000
- Why?
- Is it true?

814
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,400
You're The Mask.

815
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:55,700
Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
If I get...

816
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:58,800
a good lawyer and a deal...

817
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:01,000
I'll be out in about 10,000 years.

818
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:03,400
It's risky, coming here.

819
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:06,000
Your boyfriend might be upset.

820
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:11,700
He'll be at the charity ball tonight.

821
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,100
Like what? The Lambada?

822
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:18,300
This is serious. There must be a way
to stop him.

823
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,500
How does it work?

824
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,700
I don't know.

825
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,100
It's like...

826
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:29,600
it brings your innermost desires
to life.

827
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:31,900
If deep down inside...

828
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:36,400
you're a bit repressed and
hopelessly romantic...

829
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,600
you become some sort of...

830
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:41,300
a love-crazy wild man.

831
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,400
And if you're like Dorian?

832
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,300
Then we're all in big trouble.

833
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:49,300
And if I were you,
I'd get out of town. Fast.

834
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:53,500
Thanks.

835
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:55,600
For what?

836
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,900
Lots of things.

837
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,100
Sharing a sunset with me.

838
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:09,400
For being the only guy who treated me
like a person, not...

839
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:10,700
a party favor.

840
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,800
For being any kind of romantic...

841
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:18,700
even a hopeless one.

842
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:26,300
You're welcome.

843
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:29,000
That night at the club I knew...

844
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:32,000
I'd found someone special.

845
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,400
The Mask.

846
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:40,400
It was the guy inside The Mask.

847
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:44,000
It was you all along.

848
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:52,100
Lady, time's up.

849
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,100
Could I have just...

850
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,000
one more minute?

851
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,400
I've got to disappear for a while now.

852
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:04,100
Don't know where but I'll let you know
as soon as I can.

853
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,800
Somebody help me!

854
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,300
Guard, guard!

855
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:00,600
A woman's being chased in the alley.

856
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:02,600
She needs help.

857
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:05,400
Sure. Keep it down.

858
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:08,200
Serve and protect, man!

859
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:31,100
Good boy. Come on.

860
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,400
Jump up. Can you jump up?

861
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:40,100
Remember how I taught you not to
jump up on people? Forget that.

862
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,200
Come on! Get up here.

863
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,300
Get up. Get up here!

864
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,700
Get up. Get up here. That's it.

865
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,300
You can do it.
Come on. Come on!

866
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,500
Put some effort into it!

867
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:17,000
Baby, there you are.

868
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,900
I was worried about you.

869
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,000
- You talk to the cops?
- Only to see what Ipkiss told them.

870
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:27,200
That's right, you and Stanley.
You two are getting awfully close.

871
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:30,300
Bet you helped him with the bank job.

872
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,200
- That's ridiculous.
- Oh, is it?

873
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:37,000
Look what I found in her car.

874
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:40,200
Going away alone, baby?

875
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,500
Boys, I want you to...

876
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:49,100
get her something pretty to wear.

877
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:54,200
We're going to a party tonight.

878
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:57,000
We'll have one hell of a time, right?

879
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,000
Get out of my sight.

880
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:02,700
Jump up.

881
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:03,900
Get up. Come on.

882
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:08,700
Come on, Milo. Jump, please.

883
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:10,900
Do it for Daddy.

884
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,500
That's it!

885
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:20,500
God, I can't believe it.

886
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,700
Good boy. Good boy.

887
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:29,700
See that man over there?

888
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,400
He's got keys.

889
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:35,000
Go get those keys.

890
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:37,700
Go get them. Go get the keys.

891
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:41,100
That's it.

892
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,500
The key.

893
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:51,600
No, not the cheese, the keys.

894
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,800
Drop the cheese...

895
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:58,700
and get the keys.

896
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,400
Over there, over there.

897
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:21,900
Oh, man. Come on.

898
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,400
Come here. Good boy. That's a good boy.

899
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:28,200
Give it, give me the keys.
Give me the keys.

900
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:31,000
Come on, drop it, drop it.

901
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:33,200
It's sundown.

902
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:35,100
It's almost time.

903
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,300
I wouldn't, darling.

904
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:41,800
DANGER
EXPLOSIVES

905
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:44,800
Wouldn't want to start the
celebration early.

906
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:30,700
Hold it!

907
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:32,500
I am warning you...

908
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:34,900
I am seriously stressed out here.

909
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:36,100
Easy.

910
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:38,100
Come on.

911
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,500
Don't be an idiot.

912
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:44,200
You're in a police station. There is no
way you'll walk out of here like this.

913
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:47,400
You're know, you're right.

914
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,900
- Absolutely right.
- What are you doing?

915
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:55,800
You'll take me out...

916
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:57,600
as your prisoner.

917
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:00,400
Put it on! Put it on!

918
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,300
Come on.

919
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:06,100
- I'm really very sorry about this.
- I'm sure.

920
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:10,900
You got the wrong guy.

921
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:12,400
It's a bum rap.

922
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,100
I got my rights.

923
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:16,200
Where are you taking Ipkiss?

924
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:19,300
Ixnay! Ehay's otgay an ungay.

925
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:22,900
I get it. Pig Latin, right?

926
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,900
Eesay ouyay aterlay.

927
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:27,500
Come on!

928
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:37,700
Sit back and relax.

929
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:42,600
I must change for the party.

930
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:55,100
TONIGHT, CASINO

931
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:00,800
WAR ORPHANS FUND

932
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:15,600
I need cigarettes.

933
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:18,000
- Which brand?
- It doesn't matter, I don't smoke.

934
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:20,800
But for you, I would shoot
the Surgeon General.

935
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,200
Mayor Tilton, may we have a word?

936
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:28,700
I always have time for the press
and my loyal constituents.

937
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,500
Let me out of these cuffs,
you drive like a maniac.

938
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,900
Sorry, we're late for the ball.

939
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,700
Alice and the rabbit'll be
disappointed.

940
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:14,400
Now you're being cynical.

941
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:18,400
Who are you?

942
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:21,500
I'm just an ex-employee...

943
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,200
who's come for his back pay.

944
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,600
Or should I say payback?

945
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,800
Kill him.

946
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:52,300
Come on.

947
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:15,800
Ladies and gentlemen...

948
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,900
I will be the host...

949
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
for the rest of the evening.

950
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:33,100
Get your dog away from me.

951
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,500
Sorry, he seems to be attracted to you.

952
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:39,700
Where's everyone?
Something's not kosher.

953
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:41,000
- Exactly.
- Watch it!

954
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:42,300
Sorry.

955
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,800
I must lock you in.

956
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:47,500
Use the radio.

957
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,000
You know, call for back-up
or something.

958
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:56,800
This could be dangerous.
Stay here and be a good boy.

959
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,700
Daddy has to go kick some ass.

960
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:06,900
He's a dead man.

961
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,800
Down! Get down!

962
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:13,700
Take it easy, I got the point.

963
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:26,200
Blow it!

964
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:36,300
Bastard.

965
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,100
What's the matter, darling?

966
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:40,200
This is your big production number.

967
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:42,700
And you know it's important...

968
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:45,100
to go out with a big bang.

969
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,900
Why are you here?

970
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,500
Take this gun and start
sneaking people out the back.

971
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:04,800
Step back.

972
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:08,300
- Do you know who I am?
- A dead man if you don't step back.

973
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:10,300
What about some respect?

974
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:13,100
- What kind of thug are you?
- All set, Dorian.

975
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:16,900
That's it.

976
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,200
This party's over...

977
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:22,200
in 10 minutes.

978
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:26,300
This is the moment when a man...

979
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,600
shows what he's really made of.

980
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:30,900
Crap.

981
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,800
Drop it.

982
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:46,900
Smart dog.

983
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:56,800
Boss, look who decided to crash
the party.

984
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:59,200
How's it going?

985
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:01,100
Bring him up here!

986
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:04,500
Wait! No!

987
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:08,200
This is no time for last requests.

988
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:10,800
But all I wanted was a kiss.

989
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:13,200
A kiss?

990
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:15,200
Just one...

991
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:17,300
Iast kiss.

992
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,300
I can't shut it off.

993
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:23,100
There's always time...

994
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:27,000
for one last kiss.

995
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,200
From the real Dorian.

996
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:37,900
The one I used to love.

997
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,300
Nobody ever kissed me
like Dorian Tyrel.

998
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:43,400
Romeo!

999
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:45,500
This place will blow!

1000
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,900
Just wait!

1001
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,300
I've decided...

1002
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:05,000
to give her one last thrill.

1003
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:17,400
Get it!

1004
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,000
Run, Milo!

1005
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:42,100
Stanley, hurry!

1006
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:43,800
Don't worry.

1007
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:45,700
It's all over now.

1008
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:57,600
Got you.

1009
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:11,800
I'll take you apart.

1010
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:16,200
I hope you can enjoy the victory
with one freaking eye!

1011
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:35,700
Good doggie.

1012
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:36,800
Good doggie.

1013
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:57,500
I'm winning!

1014
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:22,700
JACKPOT

1015
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Oh, my God!

1016
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:40,300
This must be a new breed.

1017
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:41,800
Easy, boy!

1018
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:46,800
Good boy!

1019
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:19,500
Did you miss me?

1020
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:28,300
I guess not!

1021
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:38,800
Now, you have to ask yourself
one question:

1022
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:41,400
"Do I feel lucky?"

1023
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:42,400
Well...

1024
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:46,800
do you...

1025
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:48,500
punks?

1026
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,100
That's a spicy meatball.

1027
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,500
How do?

1028
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:44,400
This guy's incorrigible.

1029
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,500
You were good, kid, real good...

1030
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:18,200
but as long as I'm around
you'll be second-best.

1031
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,100
Police! Hands up!

1032
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:45,000
Officers, arrest those men.

1033
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,600
I've always wanted to say that.

1034
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:51,800
Come on.

1035
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:54,500
Give me that gun.

1036
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:03,500
He stole all our jewelry.
Take me to headquarters...

1037
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,500
Stop that man!

1038
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:09,900
I've got you now.

1039
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:12,100
Watch it, Chunky!

1040
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:15,100
- Mayor Tilton, I'm so--
- What's wrong with you?

1041
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:16,900
That man is The Mask.

1042
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:21,000
No. Dorian Tyrel was The Mask.
I saw it with my own eyes.

1043
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:23,200
This man here saved our lives.

1044
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:26,400
- With a little help.
- You're a real hero.

1045
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:29,000
It's nothing...

1046
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,100
any American with...

1047
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:34,400
balls of steel wouldn't do
for his community.

1048
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:36,600
Come on.

1049
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:41,100
Mayor Tilton, did you see that dog?

1050
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:44,000
Leave the dog alone.

1051
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:46,800
I want you in my office
first thing tomorrow.

1052
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:50,000
- Yes, Your Honor.
- That doesn't sound good at all.

1053
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:53,600
No, it doesn't.
What would sound good to you?

1054
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:55,900
- Breakfast.
- Shut up!

1055
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:17,400
Sure you know what you're doing?

1056
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:21,800
I'm sure.

1057
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:23,800
Then do what you must.

1058
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,200
Sure you won't miss this guy?

1059
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:42,600
When he's gone, all that's left is me.

1060
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,100
Smoking!
